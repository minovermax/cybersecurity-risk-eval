{"cik": "1575360", "company": "FTD Companies, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-18", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business and our common stock are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Form 10-K. Based on information currently known, we believe that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors relating to our business and our common stock.\nIf any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected, and the trading price of our common stock could materially decline.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur management has concluded, and our independent registered public accounting firm has emphasized in their report on our financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, that, due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to amend or refinance our current credit facility, our potential failure to satisfy covenant requirements during the remaining term of our credit facility and the uncertainty as to whether we will have sufficient liquidity to fund our business activities, substantial doubt exists as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our plans to alleviate the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern may not be successful and we may be forced to limit our business activities or be unable to continue as a going concern, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our generating profitable operating results; having sufficient liquidity; maintaining compliance with the revised covenants and other requirements under the Amended Credit Agreement; and refinancing or repaying the indebtedness outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement, including in connection with a sale or merger of the Company or other strategic transaction. We will need to refinance or repay the outstanding indebtedness under the Amended Credit Agreement no later than its September 2019 maturity. In the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 as well as every quarter since, management\u2019s assessment has been that there is substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs part of our efforts to address these issues, as previously announced during the third quarter of 2018, our board of directors has initiated a review of strategic alternatives. The strategic alternatives under consideration include, but are not limited to, a sale or merger of the Company, our continuing to pursue value-enhancing initiatives as a standalone company, and potential financings or equity transactions. We also announced a corporate restructuring and cost savings plan, under which opportunities to optimize operations, drive efficiency, and reduce costs have been identified.\nOn March 13, 2019, we entered into the Amended Credit Agreement, which includes, among other terms, a minimum Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA covenant; further limitations on capital expenditures; a covenant requiring that, on or before June 1, 2019, the Company shall consummate one or more transactions (i) that would permit the Company and its subsidiaries to continue as a going concern, which must provide for the repayment in full of the obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement no later than June 1, 2019, or (ii) from which all or substantially all of the aggregate net cash proceeds are used to repay obligations and permanently reduce the commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement; and updated limits on our combined usage of the revolving credit facility portion of the Amended Credit Agreement throughout its remaining term. In addition, the consolidated net leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio covenants were deleted for the period ending March 31, 2019 and subsequent periods, as was the requirement that the auditor\u2019s report on the Company\u2019s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 not contain a going concern explanatory paragraph.\nBased on our 2019 year-to-date results of operations and outlook for the remainder of the term of the Amended Credit Agreement, we currently anticipate that we will be in compliance with the Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA covenant and will have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations into July 2019 but may not have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations beyond then. In addition, there can be no assurances that we will be able to complete one or more transactions that will enable us to repay all or a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our Amended Credit Agreement by June 1, 2019, or at all. If we are unable to meet the revised covenants of the Amended Credit Agreement and we are unable to obtain waivers or further amendments from our lenders, the lenders could exercise remedies under the Amended Credit Agreement and repayment of the indebtedness outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement could be accelerated. We may not have sufficient capital to repay the obligations due under the Amended Credit Agreement upon maturity, or earlier if called for repayment by the lenders following a failure to meet the revised covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement.\nAs noted above, we will need to refinance or repay the indebtedness outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement no later than its September 2019 maturity date or earlier if called for repayment by the lenders following a failure to meet the revised covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement. There can be no assurance that we will be able to affect a financing on acceptable terms or repay this outstanding indebtedness, when required or if at all, including as a result of our strategic alternatives review. In this regard, there can be no assurance that the strategic alternatives review will result in any particular strategic alternative or strategic transaction. If we are not successful in our initiatives or do not have sufficient liquidity to fund our business activities, we may be forced to limit our business activities or be unable to continue as a going concern, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements included in this Form 10-K do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of our efforts to address these issues.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. This level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund operations, our flexibility in operating our business, and our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, including implementation of our strategic plan.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had $217.7 million of principal indebtedness outstanding with a maturity date of September 19, 2019. Such indebtedness includes $118.7 million outstanding under a term loan and $99.0 million outstanding under revolving loans. In addition, deferred financing fees of $6.2 million are accrued and included in interest payable on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018. Such fees are payable at the time our outstanding debt is either repaid, refinanced, or accelerated. We will need to refinance or repay the outstanding indebtedness no later than its September 2019 maturity, or earlier if called for repayment by the lenders following a failure to meet the revised covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement. Our substantial indebtedness could have significant consequences for our business and financial condition. For example:\n\u2022\nOur failure to comply with the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, including failure to meet payment obligations or as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default on our debt. Upon an event of default, our lenders could elect to cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to become immediately due and payable, and we would be unable to access our revolving credit facility. An event of default could materially and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\u2022\nWe may be required to dedicate a greater percentage of our cash flows to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flows to fund our strategic initiatives, make capital expenditures, investments in new technologies, and fund other general corporate requirements.\n\u2022\nOur ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital needs, strategic initiatives, capital expenditures, and other general corporate requirements could be limited. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required, it could affect our liquidity, business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, our ability to borrow additional amounts under our revolving credit facility, which is a significant source of liquidity, is subject to restrictions on our usage of the revolving credit facility and an obligation to make regularly scheduled payments, and in some circumstances prepayments, of the term loan portion of the Amended Credit Agreement. Failure to meet our borrowing conditions under our revolving credit facility could materially and adversely impact our liquidity.\n\u2022\nOur debt imposes operating and financial covenants and restrictions on us, including limitations on our ability to use cash flows for the benefit of our subsidiaries. Compliance with such covenants and restrictions may adversely affect our ability to adequately finance our operations or capital needs, pursue attractive business opportunities that may arise, sell assets, and make capital expenditures.\n\u2022\nWe may continue to experience increased vulnerability to and limited flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in or challenges relating to our business and industry, thus creating competitive disadvantages compared to other competitors with lower debt levels and borrowing costs.\n\u2022\nWe may continue to experience increased vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions, including the increases in interest rates under the Amended Credit Agreement, and if our borrowings bear interest at variable rates or if such indebtedness is refinanced at a time when interest rates are higher.\nWe cannot assure you that our cash flows, combined with additional borrowings under the current and any future credit agreements, will be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness by its maturity date, or earlier if called for repayment by the lenders following a failure to meet the revised covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement, or to fund other liquidity needs. Based on our 2019 year-to-date results of operations and outlook for the remainder of the term of the Amended Credit Agreement, we currently anticipate that we will be in compliance with the Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA covenant and will have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations into July 2019 but may not have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations beyond then. In addition, there can be no assurances that we will be able to complete one or more transactions that will enable us to repay all or a portion of the outstanding indebtedness by June 1, 2019 or at all. If we are unable to meet the revised covenants of the Amended Credit Agreement and we are unable to obtain waivers or further amendments from our lenders, the lenders could exercise remedies under the Amended Credit Agreement and repayment of the indebtedness outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement could be accelerated. We may not have sufficient capital to repay the obligations due under the Amended Credit Agreement upon maturity, or earlier if called for repayment by the lenders following a failure to meet the revised covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. For additional information regarding our Amended Credit Agreement see Footnote 6-\u201cFinancing Arrangements\u201d and the MD&A.\nDepending on the results of our strategic alternatives review process, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the September 2019 maturity date of the Amended Credit Agreement. There can be no assurance that we will be able to affect a refinancing on acceptable terms or repay this outstanding indebtedness, when required or if at all, including as a result of the strategic alternatives review noted above. In this regard, there can be no assurance that the strategic alternatives review will result in any particular strategic alternative or strategic transaction. The terms of any alternative debt may give the holders rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. The terms of any new debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than are currently in place. If we are unable to refinance our debt, we may default under the terms of our indebtedness, which could lead to an acceleration of the debt. We may not have sufficient capital to repay the obligations due under the Amended Credit Agreement upon maturity, or earlier if called for repayment by the lenders following a failure to meet the revised covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement.\nIf we are unable to successfully implement our strategic alternatives review or our corporate restructuring and cost savings plan, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nDuring the third quarter of 2018, our board of directors initiated a review of strategic alternatives focused on maximizing stockholder value. The strategic alternatives expected to be considered include, but are not limited to, a sale or merger of the Company, continuing to pursue value-enhancing initiatives as a standalone company, a capital structure optimization that may involve potential financings, or the sale or other disposition of certain of our businesses or assets. At that same time, we also announced a corporate restructuring and cost savings plan, under which we identified and implemented opportunities to optimize our operations, drive efficiency, and reduce costs.\nThe results of our efforts will not be known until sometime in the future. Successful execution of any particular strategic alternative or strategic transaction or our corporate restructuring and cost savings plan requires sustained management focus, organization, and coordination over time, as well as success in building relationships with third parties. If we are unable to execute our strategy or our corporate restructuring and cost savings plan successfully, our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, our Amended Credit Agreement includes a covenant requiring that, on or before June 1, 2019, the Company shall consummate one or more transactions (i) that would permit the Company and its subsidiaries to continue as a going concern, which must provide for the repayment in full of the obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement no later than June 1, 2019, or (ii) from which all or substantially all of the aggregate net cash proceeds are used to repay obligations and permanently reduce the commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete such a transaction by June 1, 2019, or at all. We may not have sufficient capital to repay the obligations due under the Amended Credit Agreement upon maturity, or earlier if called for repayment by the lenders following a failure to meet the revised covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement.\nCompetition could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe consumer market for flowers and gifts is highly competitive and fragmented, as consumers can purchase the products we offer from numerous sources, including traditional local retail florists, supermarkets, mass merchants, gift retailers, floral and gift mass marketers, specialty markets, and other online retailers. We believe the primary competitive factors in the consumer market are strength of brand, price, quality of products, selection, fulfillment capabilities, customer service, website performance, and ordering convenience. In both the U.S. and the U.K., our key competitors include online floral and gift retailers, including such companies as 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc., and certain mass merchants. In addition, the specialty foods category is also highly fragmented, with competition from online retailers, specialty companies, and mass merchants. Further, we compete with personalized gift retailers as well as mass merchants and other general gift companies which also offer personalized products.\nWe face intense competition in the consumer market. We expect that the sales volumes at supermarkets and mass merchants will continue to increase, and that other online floral mass marketers will continue to increase their competition with us. Some of our competitors may have significant competitive advantages over us, may engage in more significant discounting, may devote significantly greater resources to marketing campaigns or other aspects of their business, or may respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities or customer requirements.\nThe floral network services market is highly competitive as well, and retail florists and supermarkets may choose from a variety of providers that offer similar products and services. In addition, the number of retail florists has been declining over a number of years. As the number of retail florists decline, competition for the business of the remaining retail florists may intensify. We believe the primary competitive factors in this market are price, order volume, customer service, services offered, strength of brand, and fulfillment capabilities. Our key competitors in the U.S. floral network services market include providers of online or e-commerce services, retailers and wholesalers of floral-related products, and other floral network services. In the international market, our key competitors include other floral network service providers.\nIncreased competition in the consumer market or the floral network services market may result in lower revenues, reduced gross margins, loss of market share, and increased marketing expenditures. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to compete successfully or that competitive pressures will not materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur operations could be adversely affected if we fail to integrate and retain our executive leadership team or face difficulties attracting and retaining qualified personnel.\nSince early 2016, we have undergone significant transitions in our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and other key executive positions. Our success depends, in part, upon the performance of our executive leadership team. If we are unable to integrate new senior executives, if they fail to perform effectively, if we are unable to retain them, or if we are unable to attract additional qualified senior executives as needed, our strategic and other initiatives could be adversely impacted and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Further, if we are unable to recruit, retain, and motivate key personnel to maintain the current business of the Company and support our strategic and other initiatives, our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows similarly could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to online security risks, and a security breach or inappropriate access to, or use of, our networks, computer systems, or services or those of third-party vendors could expose us to liability, claims, and a loss of revenue.\nThe success of our business depends on the security of our networks and, in part, on the security of the network infrastructures of our third-party vendors. In connection with conducting our business in the ordinary course, we store and transmit customer and member information, including personally identifiable information. Unauthorized or inappropriate access to, or use of, our networks, computer systems, or services, whether intentional, unintentional or as a result of criminal activity, could potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information, including credit card information, of our customers and of third parties. A number of other websites have publicly disclosed breaches of their security, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their sites. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose members, customers, or vendors. A party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our proprietary information or the information of our members or customers, cause interruption in our operations, or damage our computers or those of our members or customers.\nA significant number of our members and customers authorize us to bill their payment card accounts (credit or debit) directly for all amounts charged by us. These members and customers provide payment card information and other personally identifiable information which, depending on the particular payment plan, may be maintained to facilitate future payment card transactions. We rely on third-party and internally-developed encryption and authentication technology to provide the security and authentication to effectively secure transmission of confidential information, including payment card numbers. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction data being breached or compromised. Non-technical means, for example, actions by an employee, can also result in a data breach. Under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store, we could be liable to the banks that issue the payment cards for their related expenses and penalties. In addition, if we fail to follow payment card industry security standards, even if there is no compromise of customer information, we could incur significant fines or lose our ability to give our members and customers the option of using payment cards. If we were unable to accept payment cards or are limited in our acceptance of payment cards, our businesses could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. Security breaches, including any breach related to us or the parties with which we have commercial relationships, could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss, litigation, and possible liability. We cannot assure you that the security measures we take will be effective in preventing these types of activities. We also cannot assure you that the security measures of our third-party vendors, including network providers, providers of customer and billing support services, and other vendors, will be adequate. In addition to potential legal liability, these activities may adversely impact our reputation or our revenues and may interfere with our ability to provide our products and services, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business. In addition, the coverage and limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches.\nSignificant problems with our key systems or those of our third-party vendors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe systems underlying the operations of our business are complex and diverse and must efficiently integrate with third-party systems, such as credit card processors. Key systems include, without limitation, order transmission, distribution, fulfillment and processing, including the systems for transmitting orders through our floral networks and to third-party suppliers; billing; website and database management; customer support; telecommunications network management; and internal financial systems. Some of these systems are outsourced to third parties, and others, such as certain of our customer service telephone systems, are not redundant. All information technology and communication systems are subject to reliability issues, denial of service attacks, integration and compatibility concerns, and security threatening intrusions. The continued and uninterrupted performance of our key systems is critical to our success. Unanticipated problems affecting these systems could cause interruptions in our services. In addition, if our third-party vendors face financial or other difficulties, our business could be adversely impacted. Any significant errors, damage, failures, interruptions, delays, or other problems with our systems or those of our third-party vendors could adversely impact our ability to satisfy our customers and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur revenues, operating results, and cash flows fluctuate on a seasonal basis and may suffer if revenues during peak seasons do not meet our expectations, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur business is seasonal, and our quarterly revenues and operating results typically exhibit seasonality. Revenues, operating results, and cash flows tend to be lower for the third quarter because none of the most popular floral and gift-giving holidays, which include Mother\u2019s Day, Valentine\u2019s Day, Christmas, Easter, and Thanksgiving, fall within that quarter. In addition, depending on the year, Easter and the U.K. Mother\u2019s Day sometimes fall within the first quarter and sometimes fall within the second quarter. Furthermore, depending on the year, certain of the most popular floral and gift-giving holidays, such as Valentine\u2019s Day, may occur on a weekend or government holiday, which historically has negatively impacted orders.\nOur ProFlowers and Gourmet Foods businesses experience a greater level of seasonality than our other businesses and have historically generated an operating loss and used cash for operations during the third quarter. Historically, a significant portion of the revenues and operating profit of these businesses have been generated in the first half of the year. Our Personal Creations business is also highly seasonal with approximately half of its revenues and substantially all of its operating profit generated in the fourth quarter during the winter holiday season.\nOur operating results may suffer if revenues during our peak seasons do not meet expectations, as we may not generate sufficient revenues to offset increased costs incurred in preparation for peak seasons. Our working capital and level of indebtedness may also fluctuate during the year as a result of the factors set forth above. Moreover, the operational risks described elsewhere in these risk factors may be significantly exacerbated if those risks were to occur during a peak season. For example, severe weather prior to or on Valentine\u2019s Day, Mother\u2019s Day, or other popular floral or gift-giving holidays could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Similarly, we could be materially and adversely affected if we do not accurately estimate customer demand and appropriately manage inventory levels within our businesses.\nWe are dependent on third parties who fulfill orders and deliver goods and services to our customers, and their failure to provide our customers with high-quality products within the required timeframe and maintain a high level of customer service may harm our brands and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe believe that our success in promoting and enhancing our brands depends on our ability to provide our customers high-quality products within the required timeframe and maintain a high level of customer service. Our business depends, in part, on the ability of our floral network members and third-party suppliers that fulfill our orders to do so at high-quality levels. We work with our floral network members and third-party suppliers to develop best practices for quality assurance; however, we generally do not directly control or continuously monitor any floral network member or third-party supplier. A failure to maintain our relationships with key floral network members and third-party suppliers or the failure of our floral network members and third-party suppliers to fulfill orders to our customers\u2019 satisfaction, at an acceptable level of quality, and within the required timeframe, could adversely impact our brands and cause us to lose customers, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAdditionally, because we depend upon third parties for the delivery of our products, strikes or other service interruptions affecting these shippers could have an adverse effect on our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis. If any of our shippers are unable or unwilling to deliver our products, we would have to engage alternative shippers, which could increase our costs. A disruption in any of our shippers\u2019 delivery of our products could cause us to lose customers or could increase our costs, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIf the supply of flowers and/or strawberries becomes limited, the price of our floral and/or strawberry products could rise or our products may become unavailable, which could result in our not being able to meet consumer demand and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nMany factors, such as weather conditions, agricultural limitations, restrictions relating to the management of pests and disease, and fair trade and other social or environmental issues, affect the supply of flowers and strawberries and the price of our floral and strawberry products. If the supply of high-quality flowers and/or strawberries available for sale is limited, the wholesale prices of flowers and strawberries could rise, which would cause us to increase our prices or could result in a reduction in our profits. An increase in our prices could result in a decline in consumer demand for our floral and strawberry products, which would decrease our revenues. Alternatively, we may not be able to obtain high-quality flowers and/or strawberries in an amount sufficient to meet consumer demand. Even if available, flowers and strawberries from alternative sources may be of lesser quality or be more expensive than those we currently offer. A large portion of our supply of flowers is sourced from Colombia, the U.S., Kenya, Holland, Ecuador, Thailand, and Costa Rica. In addition, a large portion of our supply of strawberries is sourced from the U.S. and Mexico.\nThe availability and price of our products could be affected by a number of other factors affecting suppliers, including:\n\u2022\nsevere weather;\n\u2022\nagricultural limitations;\n\u2022\ndisease, infestation, and other biological problems;\n\u2022\nimport duties and quotas;\n\u2022\ntime-consuming import regulations or controls at ports, including adequate staffing of inspection and custom agents at ports of entry;\n\u2022\nchanges in trading status;\n\u2022\neconomic uncertainties and currency fluctuations;\n\u2022\nforeign government laws and regulations;\n\u2022\npolitical, social, and economic instability, terrorist attacks, and security concerns in general;\n\u2022\nnationalization;\n\u2022\navailability of adequate labor resources for our suppliers;\n\u2022\nfair trade and other social or environmental certifications, requirements, or practices;\n\u2022\ngovernmental bans or quarantines;\n\u2022\ndisruption in transportation and delivery;\n\u2022\ntrade restrictions, including U.S. retaliation against foreign trade practices or withdrawal from, or renegotiation of international trade agreements; and\n\u2022\ntransportation availability and costs.\nOur consumer businesses rely heavily on email and social media marketing campaigns, and any disruptions or restrictions on these campaigns or an increase in the associated costs could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe generate a significant portion of our consumer orders from the emails we send to customers who have previously ordered products from us. We also engage in a number of third-party email marketing campaigns in which such third parties include our marketing offers in the emails they send.\nAn increase in the number of customers to whom we are not able to send emails, or who elect to not receive or are unable to receive our emails could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. From time to time, internet service providers block bulk email transmissions or otherwise experience technical difficulties that result in our inability to successfully deliver emails to our customers. Third parties may also block, impose restrictions on, or start to charge for the delivery of emails through their email systems. Due to the importance of email to our businesses, any disruption or restriction on the distribution of emails or increase in the associated costs could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe also utilize a number of social media platforms to generate consumer traffic to our websites. If we are unable to effectively use or maintain a presence using these platforms or if our competitors increase their spending on these types of platforms, our marketing spend could increase or our consumer traffic could decrease thus adversely affecting our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nUse of social media may adversely impact our reputation and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThere has been a substantial increase in the use of social media platforms, including blogs, social media websites and other forms of internet-based communications, which allows access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. Negative commentary regarding us or the products we sell may be posted on social media platforms or other electronic means at any time and may be adverse to our reputation or business. Customers value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy. The harm may be immediate without allowing us an opportunity for redress or correction. We maintain Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts. In addition, as laws and regulations rapidly evolve to govern the use of these platforms and devices, the failure by us, our employees or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of these platforms and devices could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on our company-operated distribution facilities and third-party distributors to fulfill certain of our customers\u2019 orders and to distribute our products into the carrier delivery system. A disruption in service at one or more of these distribution facilities, delivery failures, or delays could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur consumer businesses fulfill many customer orders through company-operated distribution facilities. We may be unable to fulfill our customers\u2019 orders through one or more of our various distribution facilities in a timely manner, or at all, due to a number of factors that may affect one or more of such distribution facilities, including:\n\u2022\na failure to maintain or renew one or more of our existing lease agreements for any of our company-operated distribution facilities;\n\u2022\na prolonged power or equipment failure;\n\u2022\na lack of availability of labor resources;\n\u2022\nan employee strike or other labor stoppage;\n\u2022\na disruption in the transportation infrastructure;\n\u2022\nweather issues at our distribution facilities or along the delivery routes;\n\u2022\na refrigeration failure; or\n\u2022\na fire, flood, hurricane, tornado, or other natural disaster.\nIn the event we are unable to fulfill our customers\u2019 orders through one or more of our distribution facilities, we will attempt to fulfill the orders via another source to ensure timely delivery. However, we cannot guarantee that our other distribution facilities or third-party suppliers will have the capacity or the variety of flowers, strawberries, or gifts to fulfill all affected orders in a timely manner. In addition, if operations from one or more of our distribution facilities become permanently disrupted due to any of the factors noted above or other factors, we may not be able to secure a replacement distribution facility in a location on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we experience temporary or permanent disruptions at one or more of our distribution facilities.\nThe success of our business is dependent on our floral network members and on the financial performance of the retail floral industry.\nA significant portion of our profitability is dependent on our floral network members. Certain relationships with floral network members are non-exclusive and subject to their discretion in terms of network participation. The amount of revenues and profits we generate from individual floral network members can vary significantly. We have lost, and may continue to lose, floral network members as a result of declines in the number of local retail florists as a result of economic factors and competition, as well as our members choosing not to do business with us. There can be no assurance that the decline in the number of floral network members will not increase in the future or that we will not lose floral network members that generate significant revenues for our business, either of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn addition, the operating and financial success of our business has been, and is expected to continue to be, dependent on the financial performance of the retail floral industry. There can be no assurance that the retail floral industry will not decline, that consumer preferences for and purchases of floral products will not decline, or that retail florist revenues or inter-city floral delivery transactions will not decline in absolute terms. A sustained decline in the sales volume of the retail floral industry could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our floral network members.\nWhen an FTD or Interflora floral network member fulfills an order from an originating member, we become liable to the fulfilling member for payment on the order, even if we do not receive payment from the originating member. Accordingly, we are exposed to the credit risk of our floral network members. We cannot provide assurances that the exposure will not be greater than the amounts we have reserved for this exposure. An increase in this exposure, coupled with material instances of defaults, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur business could suffer as a result of significant credit card or debit card fraud.\nOrders placed through our consumer websites, mobile sites and applications, or various telephone numbers typically are paid for using a credit or debit card. Our revenues and gross margins could decrease if we experience significant credit or debit card fraud. Failure to adequately detect and avoid fraudulent credit or debit card transactions could cause us to lose our ability to accept credit or debit cards as forms of payment and result in charge-backs of the fraudulently charged amounts. Furthermore, widespread credit or debit card fraud may lessen our customers\u2019 willingness to purchase products on our consumer websites, through our mobile sites and applications, or through our various telephone numbers. As a result, such failure could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are dependent on our strategic relationships to help promote our consumer websites. Failure to establish, maintain, or enhance such relationships could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe believe that our strategic relationships with leading online retailers, direct marketers, and other strategic partners are critical to attract customers, facilitate broad market acceptance of our products and brands, and enhance our sales and marketing capabilities. A failure to maintain existing strategic relationships or to establish additional relationships that generate a significant amount of traffic from other websites could limit the growth of our business. Establishing and maintaining relationships with leading online retailers and direct marketers is competitive and expensive. We may not successfully enter into additional strategic relationships. We may not be able to renew existing strategic relationships beyond their current terms or may be required to pay significant fees to maintain and expand these strategic relationships. In addition, our business may be impacted by changes that our strategic partners make to their marketing practices. Further, many online retailers, direct marketers, and other strategic partners that we may approach to establish an advertising presence or with whom we already have an existing relationship may also provide advertising services for our competitors. As a result, these companies may be reluctant to enter into, maintain, or expand a strategic relationship with us. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may suffer if we fail to enter into new strategic relationships, maintain or expand existing strategic relationships, or if these strategic relationships do not result in traffic on our websites sufficient to justify costs.\nIn addition, we are subject to many risks beyond our control that influence the success or failure of our strategic relationships. For example, if any of the online retailers or direct marketers with which we have strategic relationships experience financial or operational difficulties that materially and adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations under their agreements with us, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur marketing efforts may not be successful or may become more expensive, either of which could increase our costs and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe spend significant resources marketing our brands, products, and services. We rely on relationships with a wide variety of third parties, including internet search providers such as Google, internet advertising networks, retailers, and direct marketers, to source new customers and to promote our products and services. From time to time, we may spend additional amounts on television and radio advertising. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if:\n\u2022\nour marketing activities are inefficient or unsuccessful;\n\u2022\nimportant third-party relationships or marketing strategies, such as internet search engine marketing and search engine optimization, become more expensive or unavailable, or are suspended or terminated, for any reason;\n\u2022\nthere is an increase in the proportion of consumers visiting our websites or purchasing our products and services by way of marketing channels with higher marketing costs as compared to channels that have lower or no associated marketing costs; or\n\u2022\nif our marketing efforts do not result in our products and services being prominently ranked in internet search listings.\nForeign, state, and local governments may attempt to impose additional sales and use taxes, value added taxes, or other taxes on our business activities, including our past sales, which could decrease our ability to compete, reduce our sales, and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to income and various other taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our provision for income and other taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income and other taxes against us. The final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income and other tax provisions. The results of an audit or litigation could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn accordance with current industry practice by domestic floral and gift order gatherers and our interpretation of applicable law, our consumer businesses now collect and remit sales and use taxes on consumer orders based upon the economic nexus standards established by the 2018 U.S. Supreme Court ruling for all states that have sales taxes. If states successfully challenge our previous practice of not collecting sales and use taxes where we did not have a physical presence or any other form of jurisdictional nexus, we could incur substantial tax liabilities for past sales.\nAdditionally, in accordance with current industry practice by international floral and gift direct marketers and our consultation with subject matter experts regarding our interpretation of applicable laws, we collect and remit value-added and other taxes on certain consumer orders. Future changes in legislation, application of current legislation, or the operation of our business could result in the imposition of additional tax obligations. Moreover, if a foreign taxing authority successfully challenges our current practice or implements new legislative initiatives, we could incur substantial tax liabilities for past sales and lose future sales as a result of the increased tax that may be borne by the customer. The imposition of additional tax liabilities for past or future sales could decrease our ability to compete with other retailers and reduce our sales, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAdverse economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur products and services are discretionary and dependent upon levels of consumer spending. Consumer spending patterns are difficult to predict and are sensitive to, among other factors, the general economic climate, consumer levels of disposable income, consumer debt, and overall consumer confidence. Periods of challenging economic conditions have adversely impacted certain aspects of our businesses in a number of ways, including reduced demand, more aggressive pricing for similar products and services by our competitors, increased credit risks, increased credit card failures, a loss of customers, and increased use of discounted pricing for certain of our products and services. Periods of challenging economic conditions also may adversely impact our key vendors and customers. Such economic conditions and periods of decline in consumer spending have, in certain cases, resulted in, and may in the future result in, a variety of negative effects such as a reduction in revenues, increased costs, lower gross margin and operating margin percentages, increased allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable, increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventories, and recognition of impairments of assets, including goodwill and other intangible and long-lived assets. Any of these negative effects could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nShifts in the mix of products versus services sold and types of products and services sold could materially and adversely affect our financial results.\nThe cost of revenues associated with our products revenues is generally higher than that associated with our services revenues. In addition, the cost of revenues associated with certain products and services may be higher than that associated with other products and services. As a result, changes in the proportion of revenues that is represented by products revenues versus services revenues, and certain types of products and services versus others, could materially and adversely affect our revenues, cost of revenues, cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues, and operating income.\nShifts in the mix of products and services sold at standard pricing as compared to discounted pricing or the failure to maintain our standard pricing for products and services could materially and adversely affect our financial results.\nWe have been offering broader and greater discounts to the consumer, both on a promotional basis to consumers generally, as well as through strategic arrangements with third parties that have a fixed, and in certain cases greater, discount or other associated costs. We also offer discounts on our floral network service fees from time to time on a promotional basis. Shifts in the mix of products and services sold that have resulted in increases in the proportion of products and services sold at a discount, and at times at greater discounts, including through such strategic arrangements, have resulted, and may in the future result, in reduced revenues, an increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues, and a decrease in operating income. We currently intend to continue selling a portion of our products and services at a discount, including through such strategic arrangements, and there are no assurances that the portion of products and services sold at a discount will not continue to increase. The continued use of discounts, including through such strategic arrangements, for our products and services may result in our becoming more reliant upon offering discounts in order to sell our products and services, which could result in our having to reduce our standard pricing, and could materially and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur business and stock price may be adversely affected if we have material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to our accounting for certain cross-border indirect taxes, which required an immaterial restatement of our previously issued consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for the quarters within the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. In addition, we did not adequately design the control over the review of inputs used in the determination of the reporting unit carrying values for the testing of goodwill for impairment that allowed a material error to occur that was not detected in a timely manner and required restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017. We have enhanced our controls and fully remediated both of these material weaknesses. The existence of one or more other material weaknesses could result in material errors in our financial statements, and substantial costs and resources may be required to rectify any internal control deficiencies. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, the market price of our stock could decline significantly, we may be unable to obtain additional financing as needed, and our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe United Kingdom vote to leave the European Union could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOn June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which a majority of voters voted to leave the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d), commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d On March 29, 2017, the Prime Minister of the U.K. submitted formal notice to the E.U. in order to trigger Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This is the formal mechanism which began the two-year process of negotiating the U.K.\u2019s exit from the E.U. and the future terms of the U.K.\u2019s relationship with the E.U., including the terms of trade between the U.K. and the E.U. and potentially other countries. Subsequently, the U.K. and the E.U. have agreed to a transition period extending to December 31, 2020 during which existing laws will continue to apply. This transition period only applies in the event a withdrawal agreement on the terms of the U.K.\u2019s exit is reached by March 29, 2019 between the U.K. and the E.U. Such an agreement has not yet been reached, and both the U.K. and the E.U. continue to work toward an agreement. If an agreement is not reached by such date, the U.K. would leave the E.U. without an agreement, unless an extension to the withdrawal period is agreed.\nA withdrawal could, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the U.K. and the E.U., undermine bilateral cooperation in key geographic areas, disrupt the markets we serve, and significantly disrupt trade between the U.K. and the E.U. or other nations as the U.K. pursues independent trade relations. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to the E.U. or other markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Compliance with new laws or regulations regarding trade, delivery and other cross-border activities between the U.K. and the E.U. could be costly, negatively impacting our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. A withdrawal agreement between the U.K. and the E.U. would specify details of future arrangements between the U.K. and E.U. If the U.K. leaves the E.U. without an agreement, these arrangements would be less certain, thereby increasing the risk of disruption. Our International segment operates principally in the U.K. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our International segment contributed approximately 15% of our consolidated revenues.\nIn addition, the announcement of the referendum results was followed by significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rates, including in particular a decline in the value of the British Pound (\u201cGBP\u201d) in comparison to both the U.S. Dollar (\u201cUSD\u201d) and the Euro (\u201cEUR\u201d). Uncertainty during and after the period of negotiation could have a negative economic impact and result in further market and exchange rate volatility for several years. Any of these effects, and others that the Company cannot anticipate, could materially and adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe have sought to manage the risks and potential impact of Brexit on our U.K. business. We have established the capability of our supply chain to continue to provide the goods and services required to continue our operations, particularly the supply of labor and goods, including cut flowers. We have established a series of contingent measures should the price and/or availability of cut flowers be adversely affected in the immediate period post Brexit, whether or not a withdrawal agreement has been reached. Longer term impacts on consumer demand and long term exchange rates and tariffs are being monitored and appropriate plans will be further developed as the situation becomes clearer. We cannot, however, be certain that our measures will adequately address the risks and the potential impact of Brexit on our U.K. business. If our measures are not adequate, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially and adversely affect comparisons of our operating results.\nWe transact business in different foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily GBP and EUR. Revenues and expenses in foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in USD as the USD weakens or strengthens against such other currencies. Substantially all of the revenues of our international businesses are received, and substantially all expenses are incurred, in currencies other than the USD, which increases or decreases the related USD-reported revenues and expenses depending on the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Certain of our key business metrics, such as average order value, are similarly affected by such foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Changes in global economic conditions, market factors, and governmental actions, among other factors, can affect the value of these currencies in relation to the USD. A strengthening of the USD compared to these currencies and, in particular, to the British Pound and the Euro, has had, as noted since the Brexit announcement, and in future periods could have, an adverse effect on the comparisons of our revenues and operating income against prior periods. We cannot accurately predict the impact of future foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results, and such fluctuations could materially and adversely affect the comparisons of such results against prior periods.\nWe face risks relating to operating and doing business internationally that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur businesses operate in a number of countries outside the U.S., principally the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland for our Interflora subsidiary and India for our technology development and support operations. Conducting international operations involves risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nadverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing and staffing international operations;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added taxes and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting, tax, and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022\ncompliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside the U.S., such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022\nlack of familiarity with and unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nthe burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, regulations, and legal and regulatory standards;\n\u2022\npolitical, social, and economic instability abroad, terrorist attacks, and security concerns in general; and\n\u2022\nreduced or varied protection for intellectual property and proprietary rights.\nThe occurrence of any one of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur success is dependent on the intellectual property that we use, and any infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe regard our FTD\u00ae, Interflora\u00ae, ProFlowers\u00ae, Shari\u2019s Berries\u00ae, Personal Creations\u00ae, Flying Flowers\u00ae, Gifts.com\u2122, and ProPlants\u00ae trademarks; the Mercury Man\u00ae logo; the www.ftd.com, www.proflowers.com, www.berries.com, www.personalcreations.com, www.gifts.com, www.proplants.com, www.Interflora.co.uk, and other internet domain names; and the other service marks, trademarks, and other intellectual property that we use in our business as being critical to our success. Our company and our subsidiaries have applied for the registration of and have been issued trademark registrations for trademarks and service marks used in our business in the U.S., the U.K., and various other foreign countries; however, in some other countries, there are certain pre-existing and potentially conflicting trademark registrations held by third parties. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, and license and other agreements with employees, customers, and others to protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, we may also rely on the third-party owners of the intellectual property rights we license to protect those rights. We license some of our intellectual property rights, including the Mercury Man logo, to third parties. The steps taken by us and those third parties to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate, and other third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights. This could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Furthermore, the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual property in internet-related industries are uncertain and still evolving.\nWe are also subject to the risk of claims alleging that our business practices infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. These claims could result in lengthy and costly litigation. Moreover, resolution of any such claim against us may require our company or one of our subsidiaries to obtain a license to use the intellectual property rights at issue or possibly to cease using those rights altogether. Any of those events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIncidents involving or allegations of food-borne illnesses, food tampering, food contamination, or mislabeling relating to our products, whether or not accurate, could harm our business.\nOur product offerings include food products, which may expose us to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination, misbranding, product tampering or other adulteration, allergens, product recall, and consumer product liability claims. Issues related to quality and safety of our products, ingredients, or packaging could jeopardize our image and reputation. Instances or reports, whether true or not, of food-safety issues, such as food-borne illnesses, food tampering, food contamination or mislabeling, either during manufacturing, packaging, storing, or preparation, have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food processing, grocery, and quick-service restaurant sectors and could affect us as well. Any report linking us to food-borne illnesses or food tampering, contamination, mislabeling, or other food-safety issues could damage our brand value and severely hurt sales of our food products and possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions), or damages. If customers become ill from food-borne illnesses, tampering, contamination, mislabeling, or other food-safety issues, we could be forced to temporarily close some supply chain facilities, as well as recall products. In addition, instances of food-safety issues, even those involving solely the products or stores of competitors or of suppliers or distributors (regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors), could, by resulting in negative publicity about us or the foodservice industry in general, adversely affect our sales. A decrease in customer orders as a result of food-safety concerns or negative publicity, the payment of fines or damages relating to product recalls or food-safety claims, or litigation or government actions, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nProduct recall or liability claims could harm our business.\nProducts that we sell, including glass, ceramic, and other personalized gift products, could contain defects and/or may expose us to product liability claims in the event the use of these products results in personal injury or property damage. We have been in the past, and may be in the future, subject to product liability claims and we may incur significant costs related to such claims. Even if a product liability claim is not successful, or if we conduct a voluntary recall, we may incur substantial costs in defending the claim or conducting the recall. The insurance we maintain against product liability claims may be inadequate to cover any liabilities we may incur, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows. In addition, product liability claims often create negative publicity, which could materially damage our reputation and our brands.\nWe may be unable to increase capacity or introduce enhancements to our consumer websites, mobile sites and applications, or various telephone numbers in a timely manner or without service interruptions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nA key element of our business strategy is to generate a high volume of traffic on our consumer websites, through our mobile sites and applications, and through our various telephone numbers. However, we may not be able to accommodate all of the growth in user demand through our consumer websites, mobile sites and applications, or through various telephone numbers. Our inability to add additional hardware and software to upgrade our existing technology or network infrastructure to accommodate, in a timely manner, increased traffic through our consumer websites, our mobile sites and applications, or our various telephone numbers, may cause decreased levels of customer service and satisfaction. Failure to implement new systems effectively or within a reasonable period of time could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe also regularly introduce additional or enhanced features and services to retain current customers and attract new customers to our consumer websites, mobile sites and applications. If we introduce a feature or a service that is not favorably received, our current customers may not use our consumer websites or mobile sites and applications as frequently or we may not be successful in attracting new customers. We may also experience difficulties that could delay or prevent us from introducing new services and features. Furthermore, these new services or features may contain errors that are discovered only after they are introduced. We may need to significantly modify the design of these services or features to correct errors. If customers encounter difficulty with or do not accept new services or features, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe utilize outsourced staff and temporary employees, who may not be as well-trained or committed to our customers as our permanent employees, and their failure to provide our customers with high-quality customer service may cause our customers not to return, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe utilize and rely on a significant number of outsourced staff and temporary employees, in addition to our permanent employees, to take orders, respond to customer inquiries, and work in our distribution facilities to process and fulfill orders. These outsourced staff and temporary employees may not have the same level of commitment to our customers or be as well-trained as our permanent employees. In addition, we may not hire enough outsourced staff or temporary employees to adequately handle the increased volume of telephone calls we receive and orders we fulfill and ship during peak periods. We maintain only a limited number of permanent customer support and distribution center employees and rely on third-party vendors for outsourced customer support. Our permanent employees may not be able to provide the necessary range or level of customer support services in the event that one or more of our third-party vendors unexpectedly become unable or unwilling to provide some or all of these services to us. In addition, we may not be able to adequately staff our distribution centers during peak periods to enable us to fulfill and ship orders on a timely basis. If our customers are dissatisfied with the quality of the customer service they receive, they may not place orders with us again, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur business could be shut down or materially and adversely affected by a catastrophic event.\nA disaster such as a fire, earthquake, flood, power loss, terrorism, or other similar event, affecting any of our facilities, data centers, or computer systems, or those of our third-party vendors, or a system interruption or delay that slows down the internet or makes the internet or our websites temporarily unavailable, could result in a significant and extended disruption of our operations and services. Any prolonged disruption of our services due to these or other events would severely adversely impact our business. We do not carry flood insurance for our facilities, and the property, business interruption, and other insurance we do carry may not be sufficient to cover all losses, if any, that may occur as a result of any events which cause interruptions in our operations and services.\nLegal actions or investigations could subject us to substantial liability, require us to change our business practices, and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are currently, and have been in the past, party to various legal actions and investigations. These actions may include, without limitation, claims by private parties in connection with consumer protection and other laws; claims that we infringe on third-party patents, trademarks, copyrights, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights; securities laws claims; claims involving marketing practices or unfair competition; claims in connection with employment practices; breach of contract claims; and other business-related claims. The nature of our business could subject us to additional claims for similar matters, as well as a wide variety of other claims, including, without limitation, for privacy and security matters. The failure to successfully defend against these and other types of claims, including claims relating to our business practices, could result in our incurring significant liabilities related to judgments or settlements or require us to change our business practices. Infringement claims may also result in our being required to obtain licenses from third parties, which licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Both the cost of defending claims, as well as the effect of settlements and judgments, could cause our results of operations to fluctuate significantly from period to period and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, we also file actions against third parties from time to time for various reasons, including, without limitation, to protect our intellectual property rights, enforce our contractual rights, or make other business-related claims. The legal fees, costs, and expenses associated with these actions may be significant, and if we were to lose these actions, we may be required to pay the other party\u2019s legal fees, costs, and expenses, which also may be significant and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nVarious governmental agencies have in the past asserted claims, instituted legal actions, inquiries or investigations, or imposed obligations relating to our business practices, such as our marketing, billing, customer retention, renewal, cancellation, refund, and disclosure practices, and they may continue to do so in the future. We may not prevail in existing or future claims, and any judgment against us, settlement, or resolution of such claims may involve the payment of significant sums, including damages, fines, penalties, or assessments, or changes to our business practices. Defending against lawsuits, inquiries, and investigations also involves significant expense and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources from other matters.\nAdditional governmental investigations or other legal actions may be instituted in connection with prior sales practices or other current or former business practices. Enforcement actions or changes in enforcement policies and procedures could result in changes to our business practices, as well as significant damages, fines, penalties, or assessments, which could decrease our revenues or increase the costs of operating our business. To the extent that our services and business practices change as a result of claims or actions by governmental agencies or private parties, or we are required to pay significant sums, including damages, fines, penalties, or assessments, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be unsuccessful at acquiring future additional businesses, services, or technologies. Even if we make acquisitions in the future, it may not improve our results of operations and could also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAcquisitions of businesses, services, or technologies may provide us with an opportunity to diversify the products and services we offer, leverage our assets and core competencies, complement our existing business, or expand our geographic reach. We may evaluate a wide variety of potential strategic transactions that we believe may complement our existing business. However, we may not realize the anticipated benefits and synergies of an acquisition, and our attempts at integrating an acquired business may not be successful. Acquiring businesses, services, or technologies involves many operational and financial risks, including risks relating to:\n\u2022\ndisruption of our ongoing business and significant diversion of resources and management time from day-to-day responsibilities;\n\u2022\nacquisition financings that involve the issuance of potentially dilutive equity or the incurrence of debt;\n\u2022\nreduction of cash and other resources available for operations and other uses;\n\u2022\nexposure to risks specific to the acquired businesses, services, or technologies to which we are not currently exposed;\n\u2022\nrisks of entering markets in which we have little or no direct prior experience;\n\u2022\nunforeseen obligations or liabilities;\n\u2022\ndifficulty assimilating the acquired customer bases, technologies, and operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulty assimilating and retaining management and employees of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\npotential impairment of relationships with customers or vendors as a result of changes in management of the acquired businesses or other factors;\n\u2022\nlarge write-offs, either at the time of the acquisition or in the future, the incurrence of restructuring and other exit costs, the amortization of identifiable intangible assets, and the impairment of amounts capitalized as goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets; and\n\u2022\nlack of, or inadequate, controls, policies, and procedures appropriate for a public company, and the time, cost, and difficulties related to the implementation of such controls, policies, and procedures or the remediation of any deficiencies.\nIn addition to the risks set forth above, an acquisition of a foreign business involves risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates, potentially unfamiliar economic, political, and regulatory environments, and integration difficulties due to language, cultural, and geographic differences. Any of these risks, whether the acquired business is domestic or foreign, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nCertain members of our board of directors are employees of either Qurate or Liberty Media Corporation, which has overlapping directors and officers with Qurate, which may lead to conflicting interests.\nOur board of directors includes Christopher W. Shean, our former Interim President and Chief Executive Officer from November 1, 2016 to February 28, 2017, who is an employee of Qurate, and Robin Hickenlooper, who is an employee of Liberty Media Corporation. These individuals may have actual or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting each company.\nGovernmental regulation of the collection and use of personal information or our failure to comply with these regulations could materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe FTC regulates the collection and use of personal information obtained from individuals when accessing websites, with particular emphasis on access by minors. In addition, other governmental authorities have regulations to govern the collection and use of personal information that may be obtained from customers or visitors to websites. These regulations include requirements that procedures be established to disclose and notify users of our websites of our privacy and security policies, obtain consent from users for collection and use of personal information, and provide users with the ability to access, correct, or delete personal information stored by us. In addition, the FTC and other governmental authorities have made inquiries and investigations of companies\u2019 practices with respect to their users\u2019 personal information collection and dissemination practices to confirm these are consistent with stated privacy policies and to determine whether precautions are taken to secure consumers\u2019 personal information. The FTC and certain state agencies also have made inquiries, and in a number of situations, brought actions against companies to enforce the privacy policies of these companies, including policies relating to security of consumers\u2019 personal information.\nBecoming subject to the regulatory and enforcement efforts of the FTC, a state agency, or other governmental authority could have a material adverse effect on our ability to collect demographic and personal information from users, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our marketing efforts, business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, the negative publicity regarding the existence or results of an investigation could have an adverse impact on customers\u2019 willingness to use our websites and services and thus could adversely impact our future revenues.\nCertain of our businesses, such as our international consumer and floral network businesses, must comply with international data protection and privacy laws, including the U.K. Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation. If we or any of the third-party service providers on which we rely fail to transmit customer information and payment details in a secure manner, or if they otherwise fail to protect customer privacy in online transactions, or if they transfer personal information outside the European Economic Area without complying with certain required conditions, then we risk being exposed to civil and criminal liability in the U.K. or elsewhere in the European Union, usually in the form of fines, as well as claims from individuals alleging damages as a result of the alleged non-compliance. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nChanges in laws and regulations and new laws and regulations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to a variety of international, federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including, without limitation, those relating to taxation; marketing and advertising; privacy and data protection; food production, including safety, storage, marketing and distribution; consumer protection; supply chain operations; anti-bribery; labor; antitrust; and unclaimed property. Compliance with the various laws and regulations, which in many instances are either unclear or unsettled, is complex. New laws and regulations, such as those being considered or recently enacted by certain states or the federal government related to automatic renewal practices, user privacy, targeted or behavioral advertising, floral related fees and advertising, and taxation, could impact our revenues or certain of our business practices or those of our advertisers. Any changes in the laws and regulations applicable to us, the enactment of any additional laws or regulations, or the failure to comply with, or increased enforcement activity of, such laws and regulations, could significantly impact our products and services, our costs, or the manner in which we or our advertisers conduct business, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFuture changes in tax laws, including the rate of taxation, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFuture legislation, regulatory reform, or policy changes could have a material effect on our business and results of operations. Changes such as lower or higher corporate tax rates, repatriation allowances, removal of the interest expense deduction, increases on tariffs on imported goods, or the introduction of a border adjustment tax could impact the Company as a U.S. taxpayer, as well as the demand for our products and services.\nOn December 22, 2017, a law commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d) was enacted in the United States. Among other things, the TCJA reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% and implements a new system of taxation for non-U.S. earnings, including by imposing a one-time tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. The TCJA has had a favorable impact on our financial results in 2017, due primarily to the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The TCJA had a favorable impact on our financial results beginning in 2018 due to the reduction in the U.S. federal tax rate. In the absence of guidance on various uncertainties and ambiguities in the application of certain provisions of the TCJA, we have recorded estimates based on what we believe are reasonable interpretations and assumptions in applying the TCJA. However, it is possible that the IRS could issue subsequent guidance or take positions on audit that differ from our prior interpretations and assumptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash tax liabilities, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nWe cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade in the future. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nour ability to continue as a going concern;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain the NASDAQ listing of our common stock;\n\u2022\nour limited public float as discussed below;\n\u2022\na shift in our investor base;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nsuccess or failure of our business strategy;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain financing as needed;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting our business, including tax legislation;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u2022\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet our earnings guidance;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022\ninvestor perception of us and the floral and gift retail industry;\n\u2022\noverall market fluctuations; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and other external factors.\nStock markets in general have also experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations could materially and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nIf we fail to meet the continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ, our common stock may be delisted and the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted.\nOur common stock is listed on the NASDAQ. We must continue to satisfy the NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements, including, among other things, a minimum closing bid price requirement of $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. If a company trades for 30 consecutive business days below the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement, the NASDAQ will send a deficiency notice to the company, advising that it has been afforded a \u201ccompliance period\u201d of 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the applicable requirements. Thereafter, if such a company does not regain compliance with the bid price requirement, a second 180-day compliance period may be available. Failure to meet the minimum price per share requirement or other listing requirements for this stock exchange could result in delisting from the NASDAQ which could adversely affect the market price for our common stock and your ability to sell your shares at a profit, or at all. In addition, delisting could harm our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may result in the potential loss of confidence by investors and employees.\nThe limited public float and trading volume for FTD common stock may have an adverse impact and cause significant fluctuation of market price.\nOur common stock is held by a relatively small number of stockholders. Qurate holds 36.0% of our outstanding shares and two institutional stockholders each hold significant blocks of 7.8% to 13.1%. Our officers, directors, and members of management acquire stock or have the potential to own stock through previously granted equity awards. Consequently, our common stock has a relatively small float and low average daily trading volume, which could affect a stockholder\u2019s ability to sell our stock or the price at which it can be sold. In addition, future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by those larger stockholders, or the perception that these sales could occur, may adversely impact the market price of the stock and our stock could be difficult for a stockholder to liquidate.\nThere can be no assurance that an active trading market for our common stock will be sustained in the future. The lack of an active trading market may make it more difficult for you to sell our shares and could lead to our share price being depressed or more volatile.\nAs a significant stockholder of us, Qurate has significant influence over us, its presence may affect the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, and its interests may not coincide with yours.\nAs of December 31, 2018, Qurate beneficially owned 36.0% of the outstanding shares of FTD common stock. In connection with the acquisition of Provide Commerce, Qurate selected four new directors for appointment to the FTD board, increasing the board from seven to eleven directors, which was reduced to ten directors in April 2017. In addition, in conjunction with the acquisition of Provide Commerce, FTD and Qurate entered into an investor rights agreement (the \u201cInvestor Rights Agreement\u201d) that contains certain rights in favor of Qurate with regard to the appointment and election of Qurate nominees to the FTD board. Although the Qurate directors do not constitute a majority of the FTD board, they may exercise influence over the decisions of the FTD board. This composition of the FTD board may affect our business strategy and operating decisions, as Qurate has significant influence over our affairs, policies, and operations, such as the appointment of management, and the strategic direction of the company, including decisions as to whether to enter into or otherwise pursue strategic transactions. Qurate\u2019s interests may not in all cases be aligned with the interests of other FTD stockholders.\nFurthermore, having Qurate as a significant stockholder may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third-party to acquire, or of discouraging a third-party from seeking to acquire, a majority of the outstanding shares of FTD common stock or control of the FTD board of directors through a proxy solicitation. In that regard, the Investor Rights Agreement contains certain provisions that may magnify these risks, including Qurate\u2019s right, in certain circumstances in response to a third-party tender offer for shares of FTD common stock, to commence its own tender offer, restrictions on Qurate\u2019s ability to transfer shares of FTD common stock, the waiver of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (\u201cDGCL\u201d) with respect to Qurate and its affiliates and the prohibition upon FTD from implementing a stockholder rights plan, unless the plan exempts certain actions by Qurate in accordance with the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement.\nYour percentage ownership in our company may be diluted in the future.\nIf we issue additional equity, either through public or private offerings or rights offerings, your percentage ownership in our company would decline if you do not participate on a ratable basis. In addition, we have established equity incentive plans that provide for the grant of common stock-based equity awards to our directors, officers, and employees. Your percentage ownership in our company may be diluted in the future because of equity awards that we expect to grant under these plans.\nWe may issue preferred stock with terms that could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, privileges, preferences, including preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and distributions, terms of redemption and relative participation, or other rights, if any, of the shares of each such series of preferred stock and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nProvisions in our charter documents and the DGCL could discourage potential acquisition proposals, could delay, deter, or prevent a change in control, and could limit the price certain investors might be willing to pay for our common stock.\nCertain provisions of the DGCL and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit a change of control not approved by our board of directors or changes in the composition of our board of directors, which could result in the entrenchment of current management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at annual meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nlimitations on who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of stockholders to amend, alter, or repeal our bylaws;\n\u2022\nthe division of our board of directors into three classes with staggered terms;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nthe inability of the stockholders to act by written consent; and\n\u2022\nthe authority of our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt.\nWe believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or harmful takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with adequate time to assess any acquisition proposal and are not intended to make our company immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of our company and our stockholders.\nFuture sales of FTD common stock by Qurate, or the perception that such sales could occur, could cause our stock price to\ndecline.\nThe Investor Rights Agreement imposes certain restrictions on Qurate\u2019s ability to transfer its shares of FTD common stock. However, the Investor Rights Agreement does grant Qurate certain registration rights that, if exercised, would permit Qurate to sell a large number of shares of our common stock in a short period of time. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by Qurate or our other stockholders within a short period of time, or the perception that such sales could occur, could cause our stock price to decline or make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Relationship with Our Former Parent\nWe are bound by a Tax Sharing Agreement that we entered into with United Online in connection with the Separation.\nIn connection with the Separation, we entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that governs the rights, responsibilities, and obligations of United Online and our company with regard to various tax matters, including the payment of taxes, the preparation of tax returns, and the administration of tax audits and disputes. There are certain significant areas where the tax liabilities of our former parent may become our obligations. For example, under the Code and the related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of the United Online consolidated tax reporting group during any full or partial taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the distribution is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of the entire United Online consolidated tax reporting group for such taxable period. The Tax Sharing Agreement allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the United Online consolidated tax reporting group between us and United Online. If however, United Online were unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible, we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes, and such amounts could be significant. Other provisions of federal, state, local, or foreign law may establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax-qualified pension plans, as well as other contingent liabilities.", "PERMNO": 90554, "SIC": 5961, "TIC": "FTDCQ"}
