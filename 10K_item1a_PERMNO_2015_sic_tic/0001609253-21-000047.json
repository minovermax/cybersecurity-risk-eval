{"cik": "1609253", "company": "California Resources Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-11", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS\nDescribed below are certain risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. These risks are not the only risks we face. Our business could also be affected materially and adversely by other risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be insignificant.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nPrices for our products can fluctuate widely and an extended period of low prices could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to invest in our assets.\nOur financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to invest in our assets are highly dependent on oil, natural gas and NGL prices. A sustained period of low prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs would reduce our cash flows from operations and could reduce our borrowing capacity or cause a default under our financing agreements. In particular, as described in the risk factor below, the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic repercussions have had a significant impact on commodity prices. During the second quarter of 2020, the price of Brent crude oil reached a historic low of just under $20 per barrel. The current futures forward curve for Brent crude indicates that prices are expected to continue at about current levels for an extended time. The estimated average benchmark Brent oil price used to determine our December 31, 2020 reserves was $41.77 per barrel as compared to the average benchmark Brent oil price used to determine our 2019 year-end reserves of $63.15 per barrel, both based on SEC pricing.\nPrices for oil, natural gas and NGL may fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022changes in domestic and global supply and demand;\n\u2022domestic and global inventory levels;\n\u2022political and economic conditions;\n\u2022the actions of OPEC and other significant producers and governments;\n\u2022changes or disruptions in actual or anticipated production, refining and processing;\n\u2022worldwide drilling and exploration activities;\n\u2022government energy policies and regulation, including with respect to climate change;\n\u2022the effects of conservation;\n\u2022weather conditions and other seasonal impacts;\n\u2022speculative trading in derivative contracts;\n\u2022currency exchange rates;\n\u2022technological advances;\n\u2022transportation and storage capacity, bottlenecks and costs in producing areas;\n\u2022the price, availability and acceptance of alternative energy sources;\n\u2022regional market conditions; and\n\u2022other matters affecting the supply and demand dynamics for these products.\nLower prices could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow, including:\n\u2022reducing our proved oil and natural gas reserves over time, including as a result of impairments of existing reserves;\n\u2022limiting our ability to grow or maintain future production including a delay in the reversion dates of certain of our JVs;\n\u2022causing a reduction in our borrowing base under our Revolving Credit Facility, which could affect our liquidity;\n\u2022reducing our ability to make interest payments or maintain compliance with financial covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness, which could trigger mandatory loan repayments and default and foreclosure by our lenders and bondholders against our assets;\n\u2022affecting our ability to attract counterparties and enter into commercial transactions, including hedging, surety or insurance transactions; and\n\u2022limiting our access to funds through the capital markets and the price we could obtain for asset sales or other monetization transactions.\nOur hedging program does not provide downside protection for all of our production. As a result, our hedges do not fully protect us from commodity price declines, and we may be unable to enter into acceptable additional hedges in the future.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused crude oil prices to decline significantly in 2020, which has materially and adversely affected our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the global economy, and has resulted in, among other things, travel restrictions, business closures and the institution of quarantining and other mandated and self-imposed restrictions on movement. As a result, there has been an unprecedented reduction in demand for crude oil. The severity, magnitude and duration of current or future COVID-19 outbreaks, the extent of actions that have been or may be taken to contain or treat their impact, and the impacts on the economy generally and oil prices in particular, are uncertain, rapidly changing and hard to predict. Lower future commodity prices caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could force us to reduce costs, including by decreasing operating expenses and lowering capital expenditures, and such actions could negatively affect future production and our reserves. Starting in March 2020, we reduced our operating expenses and planned capital expenditures to those necessary to maintain mechanical integrity of our facilities to operate them in a safe and environmentally responsible manner. In addition, we shut-in wells which reduced our 2020 net production by 3 MBoe/d. These operational decisions negatively impacted our production and may materially and adversely affect the quantity of estimated proved reserves that may be attributed to our properties. Our operations also may be adversely affected if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic. In addition, we are exposed to changes in commodity prices which have been and will likely remain volatile.\nAdditionally, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic or any resulting worsening of the global business and economic environment adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening or exacerbating many of the other risks described in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d herein.\nRecent and future actions by the state of California could result in restrictions to our operations and result in decreased demand for oil and gas within the state.\nIn September 2020, Governor Gavin Newsom of California issued an executive order (Order) that seeks to reduce both the demand for and supply of petroleum fuels in the state. The Order establishes several goals and directs several state agencies to take certain actions with respect to reducing emissions of GHGs, including, but not limited to: phasing out the sale of new emissions-producing passenger vehicles, drayage trucks and off-road vehicles by 2035 and, to the extent feasible, medium and heavy duty trucks by 2045; developing strategies for the closure and repurposing of oil and gas facilities in California; and proposing legislation to end the issuance of new hydraulic fracturing permits in the state by 2024. The Order also directs the California Department of Conservation, Geologic Energy Management Division (CalGEM) to strictly enforce bonding requirements for oil and gas operations and to complete its ongoing public health and safety review of oil production and propose additional regulations, which are expected to include expanded land use setbacks or buffer zones. In October 2020, the Governor issued an executive order that establishes a state goal to conserve at least 30% of California\u2019s land and coastal waters by 2030 and directs state agencies to implement other measures to mitigate climate change and strengthen biodiversity. In February 2021, SB 467 was introduced in the state senate. If passed, the bill would ban new permits for hydraulic fracturing, acid well stimulation treatments, cyclic steaming, water flooding and steam flooding - beginning in 2022 and would ban these activities beginning in 2027. The bill would also allow local governments to prohibit such practices prior to 2027. After the bill was introduced one of the authors announced that it would also be amended to also add a 2,500 feet setback for new wells from sensitive receptors. We cannot predict the outcome of this most recent legislative effort. Previous high profile efforts to pass mandatory setbacks have failed; however, any of the foregoing developments and other future actions taken by the state may materially and adversely affect our operations and properties and the demand for our products.\nOur business is highly regulated and government authorities can delay or deny permits and approvals or change requirements governing our operations, including hydraulic fracturing and other well stimulation methods, enhanced production techniques and fluid injection or disposal, that could increase costs, restrict operations and change or delay the implementation of our business plans.\nOur operations are subject to complex and stringent federal, state, local and other laws and regulations relating to the exploration and development of our properties, as well as the production, transportation, marketing and sale of our products. Federal, state and local agencies may assert overlapping authority to regulate these areas. For example, the jurisdiction, duties and enforcement authority of various state agencies have significantly increased with respect to oil and natural gas activities in recent years, and these state agencies as well as certain cities and counties have significantly revised their regulations, regulatory interpretations and data collection and reporting requirements and plan to issue additional regulations governing various oil and natural gas activities in the future. On November 9, 2020, the EPA approved reclassification of the South Coast Air Quality Management District non-attainment area for the 2012 fine particulate matter National Ambient Air Quality Standard to \u201cserious nonattainment,\u201d which requires California to submit an attainment plan to achieve attainment as expeditiously as practicable. Any restrictions imposed by California pursuant to any future attainment plan to comply with this designation of serious nonattainment may result in increased compliance costs and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, certain of these federal, state and local laws and regulations may apply retroactively and may impose strict or joint and several liability on us for events or conditions over which we and our predecessors had no control, without regard to fault, legality of the original activities, or ownership or control by third parties.\nTo operate in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain permits, approvals and certificates from federal, state and local government authorities for a variety of activities including siting, drilling, completion, stimulation, operation, inspection, maintenance, transportation, storage, marketing, site remediation, decommissioning, abandonment, protection of habitat and threatened or endangered species, air emissions, disposal of solid and hazardous waste, fluid injection and disposal and water consumption, recycling and reuse. Failure to comply may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and/or criminal fines and penalties, liability for noncompliance, costs of corrective action, cleanup or restoration, compensation for personal injury, property damage or other losses, and the imposition of injunctive or declaratory relief restricting or prohibiting certain operations or our access to property, water, minerals or other necessary resources, and may otherwise delay or restrict our operations and cause us to incur substantial costs. Under certain environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to strict or joint and several liability for the removal or remediation of contamination, including on properties over which we and our predecessors had no control, without regard to fault, legality of the original activities, or ownership or control by third parties.\nOur customers, including refineries and utilities, and the businesses that transport our products to customers, are also highly regulated. For example, various government authorities have sought to restrict the use of oil, natural gas or certain petroleum-based products such as fuels and plastics. Federal and state pipeline safety agencies have adopted or proposed regulations to expand their jurisdiction to include more gas and liquid gathering lines and pipelines and to impose additional mechanical integrity, leak detection and reporting requirements. The state has adopted additional regulations on the storage of natural gas that could affect the demand for or availability of such storage, increase seasonal volatility, or otherwise affect the prices we receive from customers. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has commenced a rulemaking to develop a long-term natural gas planning strategy to ensure safe and reliable gas systems at just and reasonable rates during what it describes as a 25-year transition from natural gas-fueled technologies to meet the state\u2019s GHG goals. Certain municipalities have enacted restrictions on the installation of natural gas appliances and infrastructure in new residential or commercial construction, which could affect the retail natural gas market for our utility customers and the demand and prices we receive for the natural gas we produce.\nCosts of compliance may increase and operational delays or restrictions may occur as existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or as new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations, each of which has occurred in the past.\nGovernment authorities and other organizations continue to study health, safety and environmental aspects of oil and natural gas operations, including those related to air, soil and water quality, ground movement or seismicity and natural resources. For example, the California legislature expanded CalGEM duties in 2019 to include public health and safety and CalGEM is expected to complete a review of potential public health and safety concerns resulting from the impacts of oil and gas extraction activities by the first half of 2021 and to propose a rulemaking to address the findings of the agency\u2019s review. Government authorities have also adopted or proposed new or more stringent requirements for permitting, inspection and maintenance of wells, pipelines and other facilities, and public disclosure or environmental review of, or restrictions on, oil and natural gas operations, including proposed setback distances or buffer zones from other land uses, as well as proposals to declare oil and gas production a non-conforming use in certain jurisdictions in an effort to prevent future development or phase out existing production over time. Such requirements or associated litigation could result in potentially significant added costs to comply, delay or curtail our exploration, development, fluid injection and disposal or production activities, preclude us from drilling, completing or stimulating wells, or otherwise restrict our ability to access and develop mineral rights, any of which could have an adverse effect on our expected production, other operations and financial condition.\nChanges to elected or appointed officials or their priorities and policies could result in different approaches to the regulation of the oil and natural gas industry. We cannot predict the actions the Governor of California or the California legislature may take with respect to the regulation of our business, the oil and natural gas industry or the state\u2019s economic, fiscal or environmental policies, nor can we predict what actions may be taken at the federal level with respect to health, environmental safety, climate, labor or energy laws, regulations and policies, including those that may directly or indirectly impact our operations.\nRecent actions by the Biden administration could result in restrictions to our operations\nIn January 2021, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced that it was restricting its employees for a period of 60 days, other than senior identified leadership, from approving certain activities including entering into new leases or approving drilling permits on public lands and waters. Approximately 9% of our net production is on federal lands and the Biden administration may extend such restrictions or add others that make it more difficult or costly to operate on these lands.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas carry significant operational and financial risks and uncertainty. We may not drill wells at the times we scheduled, or at all. Wells we do drill may not yield production in economic quantities or generate the expected payback.\nThe exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties depend in part on our analysis of geophysical, geologic, engineering, production and other technical data and processes, including the interpretation of 3D seismic data. This analysis is often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. We also bear the risks of equipment failures, accidents, environmental hazards, unusual geological formations or unexpected pressure or irregularities within formations, adverse weather conditions, permitting or construction delays, title disputes, surface access disputes, disappointing drilling results or reservoir performance (including lack of production response to workovers or improved and enhanced recovery efforts) and other associated risks.\nOur decisions and ultimate profitability are also affected by commodity prices, the availability of capital, regulatory approvals, available transportation and storage capacity, the political environment and other factors. Our cost of drilling, completing, stimulating, equipping, operating, inspecting, maintaining and abandoning wells is also often uncertain.\nAny of the forgoing operational or financial risks could cause actual results to differ materially from the expected payback or cause a well or project to become uneconomic or less profitable than forecast.\nWe have specifically identified locations for drilling over the next several years, which represent a significant part of our long-term growth strategy. Our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified. If future drilling results in these projects do not establish sufficient reserves to achieve an economic return, we may curtail drilling or development of these projects. We make assumptions about the consistency and accuracy of data when we identify these locations that may prove inaccurate. We cannot guarantee that our identified drilling locations will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce crude oil or natural gas from these drilling locations. In addition, some of our leases could expire if we do not establish production in the leased\nacreage. The combined net acreage covered by leases expiring in the next three years represented 17% of our total net undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2020.\nOur business can involve substantial capital investments, which may include acquisitions or JVs. We may be unable to fund these investments which could lead to a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves or production. Our capital investment program is also susceptible to risks that could materially affect its implementation.\nOur exploration, development and acquisition activities can involve substantial capital investments. Following our emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, our capital investments will mainly be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. We seek to manage our internally funded capital investments to align with projected cash flow from operations. Accordingly, a reduction in projected operating cash flow could cause us to reduce our future capital investments. In general, the ability to execute our capital plan depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs we are able to produce;\n\u2022commodity prices;\n\u2022regulatory and third-party approvals;\n\u2022our ability to timely drill, complete and stimulate wells;\n\u2022our ability to secure equipment, services and personnel; and\n\u2022the availability of external sources of financing.\nAccess to future capital may be limited by our lenders, our JV partners, capital markets constraints, activist funds or investors, or poor stock price performance. Because of these and other potential variables, we may be unable to deploy capital in the manner planned, which may negatively impact our production levels and development activities and limit our ability to make acquisitions or enter into JVs.\nUnless we make sufficient capital investments and conduct successful development and exploration activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Our ability to make the necessary long-term capital investments or acquisitions needed to maintain or expand our reserves may be impaired to the extent we have insufficient cash flow from operations or liquidity to fund those activities. Over the long term, a continuing decline in our production and reserves would reduce our liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt obligations by reducing our cash flow from operations and the value of our assets.\nFrom time to time we may engage in exploratory drilling, including drilling in new or emerging plays. Our drilling results are uncertain, and the value of our undeveloped acreage may decline if drilling is unsuccessful.\nThe risk profile for our exploration drilling locations is higher than for other locations because we have less geologic and production data and drilling history, in particular for those exploration drilling locations in unconventional reservoirs, which are in unproven geologic plays. Our ability to profitably drill and develop our identified drilling locations depends on a number of variables, including crude oil and natural gas prices, capital availability, costs, drilling results, regulatory approvals, available transportation capacity and other factors. We may not find commercial amounts of oil or natural gas or the costs of drilling, completing, stimulating and operating wells in these locations may be higher than initially expected. If future drilling results in these projects do not establish sufficient reserves to achieve an economic return, we may curtail drilling or development of these projects. In either case, the value of our undeveloped acreage may decline and could be impaired.\nOur producing properties are located exclusively in California, making us vulnerable to risks associated with having operations concentrated in this geographic area.\nOur operations are concentrated in California. Because of this geographic concentration, the success and profitability of our operations may be disproportionately exposed to the effect of regional conditions. These include local price fluctuations, changes in state or regional laws and regulations affecting our operations and other regional supply and demand factors, including gathering, pipeline, transportation and storage capacity constraints, limited potential customers, infrastructure capacity and availability of rigs, equipment, oil field services, supplies and labor. Our operations are also exposed to natural disasters and related events common to California, such as wildfires, mudslides, high winds and earthquakes. Further, our operations may be exposed to power outages, mechanical failures, industrial accidents or labor difficulties. Any one of these events has the potential to cause producing wells\nto be shut in, delay operations and growth plans, decrease cash flows, increase operating and capital costs, prevent development of lease inventory before expiration and limit access to markets for our products.\nMany of our current and potential competitors have or may potentially have greater resources than we have and we may not be able to successfully compete in acquiring, exploring and developing new properties.\nWe face competition in every aspect of our business, including, but not limited to, acquiring reserves and leases, obtaining goods and services and hiring and retaining employees needed to operate and manage our business and marketing natural gas, NGLs or oil. Competitors include multinational oil companies, independent production companies and individual producers and operators. In California, our competitors are few and large, which may limit available acquisition opportunities. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to address such competitive factors more effectively than we can or withstand industry downturns more easily than we can.\nOur commodity price risk-management activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks.\nOur commodity price risk-management activities may prevent us from realizing the full benefits of price increases above any levels set in certain derivative instruments we may use to manage price risk. In addition, our commodity price risk-management activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging or other price-risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements.\nUnder the Revolving Credit Facility, we are required to maintain acceptable commodity hedges hedging no less than (i) 75% of our reasonably anticipated oil production from our proved reserves for the first 24 months after the closing of the Revolving Credit Facility, which occurred upon emergence from bankruptcy and (ii) 50% of our reasonably anticipated oil production from our proved reserves for a period from the 25th month through the 36th month after the same date. The Revolving Credit Facility specifies the forms of hedges and prices (which can be prevailing prices) that must be used.\nFor the remaining duration of the Revolving Credit Facility, we must maintain acceptable commodity hedges for no less than 50% of the reasonably anticipated total forecasted production of crude oil from our oil and gas properties for at least 24 months following the date of delivery of each reserve report. We may not hedge more than 80% of reasonably anticipated total forecasted production of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs from our oil and gas properties for a 48-month period.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), enacted in 2010, established federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market and entities, like us, that participate in that market. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act required the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission to promulgate a range of rules and regulations applicable to OTC derivatives transactions. These regulations may affect both the size of positions that we may enter and the ability or willingness of counterparties to trade opposite us, potentially increasing costs for transactions. Moreover, the effects of these regulations could reduce our hedging opportunities which could adversely affect our revenues and cash flow during periods of low commodity prices.\nIn addition, U.S. regulators adopted a final rule in November 2019 implementing a new approach for calculating the exposure amount of derivative contracts under the applicable agencies\u2019 regulatory capital rules, referred to as the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR). Certain financial institutions are required to comply with the new SA-CCR rules beginning on January 1, 2022. The new rules could significantly increase the capital requirements for certain participants in the OTC derivatives market in which we participate. These increased capital requirements could result in significant additional costs being passed through to end users like us or reduce the number of participants or products available to us in the OTC derivatives market. These regulations could result in a reduction in our hedging opportunities or substantially increase our cost of hedging, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions may implement regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we transact with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions or counterparties with other businesses that subject them to regulation in foreign jurisdictions, we may become subject to or otherwise impacted by such regulations, which could also adversely affect our hedging opportunities.\nOur actual financial results after emergence from bankruptcy may differ significantly from the projections included in our Plan. In addition, our actual financial results may not be comparable to our historical financial information as a result of the implementation of our Plan and our adoption of fresh start accounting.\nIn connection with the disclosure statement we filed with the Bankruptcy Court, and the hearing to consider confirmation of our Plan, we prepared projected financial information to demonstrate to the Bankruptcy Court the feasibility of our Plan and our ability to continue operations upon our emergence from bankruptcy. Those projections were prepared solely for the purpose of the bankruptcy proceedings and have not been, and will not be, updated on an ongoing basis and should not be relied upon by investors. At the time they were prepared, the projections reflected numerous assumptions concerning our anticipated future performance with respect to prevailing and anticipated market and economic conditions that were and remain beyond our control and that may not materialize. Projections are inherently subject to substantial and numerous uncertainties and to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and the assumptions underlying the projections and/or valuation estimates may prove to be wrong in material respects. Actual results will likely vary significantly from those contemplated by the projections. As a result, investors should not rely on these projections.\nIn addition, upon our emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted fresh start accounting, as a result of which our assets and liabilities were recorded at fair value, which are materially different than the amounts reflected in our historical financial statements. Accordingly, our future financial statements may not be comparable to our historical financial statements.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nOur existing and future indebtedness may adversely affect our cash flows and ability to operate our business, remain in compliance and repay our debt.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $599 million of total long-term debt, and additional borrowing capacity of $307 million under the Revolving Credit Facility (after taking into account $134 million of outstanding letters of credit). In addition, as of December 31, 2020, on a pro forma basis giving effect to the January 2021 issuance of our Senior Notes as described in Part II, Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity, High Yield Debt Offering, we would have had approximately $397 million available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility (after taking into account $134 million of outstanding letters of credit). The indenture that governs the Senior Notes permits us to incur significant additional debt, some of which may be secured. Our level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u2022limit management\u2019s discretion in operating our business and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to service our existing debt, thereby reducing the cash available to finance our operations and other business activities due to restrictions on our ability to obtain additional financing, make investments, lease equipment, sell assets and engage in business combinations;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to downturns and adverse developments in our business and the economy generally;\n\u2022limit our ability to access the capital markets to raise capital on favorable terms or to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other expenses, or to refinance existing indebtedness;\n\u2022make it more likely that a reduction in our borrowing base following a periodic redetermination could require us to repay a portion of our then-outstanding bank borrowings;\n\u2022make us vulnerable to increases in interest rates as our indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility varies with prevailing interest rates;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with lower levels of indebtedness in relation to their overall size or less restrictive terms governing their indebtedness; and\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Notes or other debt and increase the risk that we may default on our debt obligations.\nOur ability to satisfy our obligations depends on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow, and future financings may not be available to provide sufficient net proceeds, to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategy.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy the obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur earnings and cash flow could vary significantly from year to year due to the nature of our industry despite our commodity price risk-management activities. As a result, the amount of debt that we can manage in some periods may not be appropriate for us in other periods. Additionally, our future cash flow may be insufficient to meet our debt obligations and other commitments at that time. Any insufficiency could negatively impact our business. A range of economic, competitive, business and industry factors will affect our future financial performance, and, as a result, our ability to generate cash flow from operations and to pay our debt obligations. Many of these factors, such as oil and natural gas prices, economic and financial conditions in our industry and the global economy and initiatives of our competitors, are beyond our control as discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nOur lenders could limit our borrowing capabilities and restrict our ability to use or access capital.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility is an important source of our liquidity. Our ability to borrow under our Revolving Credit Facility is limited by our borrowing base, the size of our lenders\u2019 commitments and our ability to comply with covenants, including various leverage ratios, hedging requirements and reporting obligations.\nThe borrowing base under our Revolving Credit Facility is redetermined semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year. Our lenders determine our borrowing base by reference to the value of our reserves and other factors that the administrative agent may deem appropriate in good faith in accordance with its usual and customary oil and gas lending criteria as they exist at the particular time. The lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility may also factor other liabilities, including our other indebtedness, into the determination of our borrowing base. Currently, our borrowing base is set at $1.2 billion. Availability under our Revolving Credit Facility is the least of (i) the then-effective borrowing base, (ii) the then-effective aggregate commitments and (iii) the aggregate elected commitment amount, which is currently set at $540 million. The aggregate revolving commitment is subject to an automatic reduction if additional commitments from new lenders are not obtained. As a result, we expect the aggregate commitment of our lenders will be reduced to $492 million in April 2021.\nAny reduction in our borrowing base could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and may hinder our ability to execute on our business strategy.\nRestrictive covenants in our Revolving Credit Facility may limit our financial and operating flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2020, total outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility were $99 million and we had $307 million of available borrowing capacity after taking into account $134 million of outstanding letters of credit. Our Revolving Credit Agreement permits us to incur significant additional indebtedness as well as certain other obligations. In addition, we may seek amendments or waivers from our existing lenders to the extent we need to incur indebtedness above amounts currently permitted by our financing agreements.\nOur Revolving Credit facility contains certain restrictions, which may have adverse effects on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations, limiting our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022incur additional liens;\n\u2022pay dividends or make other distributions;\n\u2022make investments, loans or advances;\n\u2022sell or discount receivables;\n\u2022enter into mergers;\n\u2022sell properties;\n\u2022enter into or terminate hedge agreements;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022maintain gas imbalances;\n\u2022enter into take-or-pay contracts or make other prepayments;\n\u2022enter into sale and leaseback agreements;\n\u2022prepay or modify the terms of junior debt;\n\u2022enter into negative pledge agreements;\n\u2022enter into production sharing contracts;\n\u2022amend our organizational documents; and\n\u2022make capital investments.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement also requires us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants, including a leverage ratio and current ratio.\nA breach of any of these restrictive covenants could result in a default under the Revolving Credit Facility. If a default occurs, the lenders may elect to declare all borrowings thereunder outstanding, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. If we are unable to repay our indebtedness when due or declared due, the lenders thereunder will also have the right to proceed against the collateral pledged to them to secure the indebtedness.\nVariable rate indebtedness under our Revolving Credit Facility subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly. In addition, uncertainty relating to the LIBOR calculation process and potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect the market value of our current or future indebtedness.\nBorrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. As such, our results of operations are sensitive to movements in interest rates. There are many economic factors outside our control that have in the past and may, in the future, impact rates of interest including publicly announced indices that underlie the interest obligations related to a certain portion of our debt. Factors that impact interest rates include governmental monetary policies, inflation, economic conditions, changes in unemployment rates, international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our results of operations would be adversely impacted. Such increases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, a transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as a benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate may affect the cost of servicing our debt under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom has announced that it plans to phase out LIBOR by the end of calendar year 2021. Although the Revolving Credit Agreement provides for alternative base rates, such alternative base rates may or may not be related to LIBOR, and the consequences of the phase out of LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted at this time. For example, if any alternative base rate or means of calculating interest with respect to our outstanding variable rate indebtedness leads to an increase in the interest rates charged, it could result in an increase in the cost of such indebtedness, impact our ability to refinance some or all of our existing indebtedness or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, the discontinuation, reform or replacement of LIBOR or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our common stock may decline, and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at prices equal to or greater than the price you paid or at all.\nThe trading price of our common stock may decline for many reasons, some of which are beyond our control. In the event of a drop in the market price of our common stock, you could lose a substantial part or all of your investment in our common stock. Numerous factors, including those referred to in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section could affect our stock price. These factors include, among other things, changes in our results of operations and financial condition; changes in commodity prices; changes in the national and global economic outlook; changes in\napplicable laws and regulations; variations in our capital plan; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or ratings agencies; changes in market valuations of comparable companies; and additions or departures of key personnel.\nFuture sales of our common stock could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.\nWe may sell additional shares of common stock in subsequent public or private offerings. We may also issue additional shares of common stock or convertible securities. As of February 28, 2021, we had 83,319,660 outstanding shares of common stock and 4,384,182 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nThere is an increased potential for short sales of our common stock due to the sales of shares issued upon exercise of warrants, which could materially affect the market price of the stock.\nDownward pressure on the market price of our common stock that likely will result from sales of our common stock issued in connection with the exercise of warrants could encourage short sales of our common stock by market participants. Generally, short selling means selling a security, contract or commodity not owned by the seller. The seller is committed to eventually purchase the financial instrument previously sold. Short sales are used to capitalize on an expected decline in the security\u2019s price. Such sales of our common stock could have a tendency to depress the price of the stock, which could increase the potential for short sales..\nThe ownership position of certain of our stockholders limits other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters and could affect the price of our common stock.\nBased on the most recent available public information, four of our shareholders collectively own approximately 72% of our common stock. As a result, each of these stockholders, or any entity to which such stockholders sell their stock, may be able to exercise significant control over matters requiring stockholder approval. Further, because of this large ownership position, if these stockholders sell their stock, the sales could depress our share price.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nConcerns about climate change and other air quality issues may materially affect our operations or results.\nGovernmental, scientific and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions, and regulation of GHGs and other air quality issues, may materially affect our business in many ways, including increasing the costs to provide our products and services and reducing demand for, and consumption of, our products and services, and we may be unable to recover or pass through a significant portion of our costs. In addition, legislative and regulatory responses to such issues at the federal, state and local level may increase our capital and operating costs and render certain wells or projects uneconomic, and potentially lower the value of our reserves and other assets. Both the EPA and California have implemented laws, regulations and policies that seek to reduce GHG emissions. California\u2019s cap-and-trade program operates under a market system and the costs of such allowances per metric ton of GHG emissions are expected to increase in the future as the CARB tightens program requirements and annually increases the minimum state auction price of allowances and reduces the state\u2019s GHG emissions cap. As the foregoing requirements become more stringent, we may be unable to implement them in a cost-effective manner, or at all. In recent years, the regulation of methane emissions from oil and gas facilities has been subject to uncertainty. In September 2020, the Trump Administration revised prior regulations to rescind certain methane standards and remove the transmission and storage segments from the source category for certain regulations. However, on January 20, 2021, President Biden signed an executive order calling for the suspension, revision, or rescission of the September 2020 rule and the reinstatement or issuance of methane emissions standards for new, modified, and existing oil and gas facilities.\nInternationally, the United Nations-sponsored Paris Agreement requires member states to individually determine and submit non-binding emissions reduction targets every five years after 2020. President Biden has signed\nexecutive orders recommitting to the Paris Agreement, and calling on the federal government to develop the United States' emissions reduction target. In addition, the current and former Governor of California and certain municipalities in California have announced their commitment to adhere to GHG reductions called for in the Paris Agreement through executive orders, pledges, resolutions and memoranda of understanding or other agreements with various other countries, U.S. states, Canadian provinces and municipalities.\nConcern over climate change and GHG and other emissions has also resulted in increasing political risks in California and the United States, including climate change related pledges made by various candidates for and holders of public office. On January 27, 2021 President Biden issued an executive order calling for substantial action on climate change, including, among other things, the increased use of zero-emissions vehicles by the federal government, the elimination of subsidies provided to the fossil fuel industry, and increased emphasis on climate-related risk across governmental agencies and economic sectors. The January 27 order also suspends the issuance of new leases for oil and gas development on federal lands, to the extent permitted by law, pending completion of a review of current practices. Other actions that could be pursued by President Biden include more restrictive requirements for the establishment of pipeline infrastructure or other GHG emissions limitations for oil and gas facilities, which could negatively impact our operations and the value or use of our properties. Additionally, various claimants, including certain municipalities, have filed litigation alleging that energy producers are liable for damages attributed to climate change. Suits have also been brought against such companies under shareholder and consumer protection laws, alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change but failed to adequately disclose those impacts.\nIn addition, other current and proposed international agreements and federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies seek to restrict or reduce the use of petroleum products in transportation fuels, electricity generation, plastics and other applications, prohibit future sale or use of vehicles, appliances or equipment that require petroleum fuels, impose additional taxes and costs on producers and consumers of petroleum products and require or subsidize the use of renewable energy. California has set an ambitious goal by executive order to be \u201ccarbon-neutral\u201d by 2045 and initiated and funded studies to identify strategies to implement this goal. The California legislature, state agencies and various municipalities have adopted or proposed laws, regulations and policies that seek to significantly reduce emissions from vehicles, increase the use of \u201czero emission\u201d vehicles, reduce the use of plastics, increase renewable energy mandates for utilities and in residential and commercial construction, and replace natural gas appliances and infrastructure in residential and commercial buildings with electric appliances.\nGovernment authorities can impose administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations, and various state and local agencies are conducting increased regional, community and field air monitoring specifically with respect to oil and natural gas operations. In addition, California air quality laws and regulations, particularly in Southern and Central California where most of our operations are located, are in most instances more stringent than analogous federal laws and regulations. For example, the San Joaquin Valley will be required to adopt more rigorous attainment plans under the Clean Air Act to comply with federal ozone and particulate matter standards, and these efforts could affect our activities in the region and our ability and cost to obtain permits for new or modified operations.\nTo the extent financial markets view climate change and GHG or other emissions as an increasing financial risk, this could adversely impact our cost of, and access to, capital and the value of our stock and our assets. Current investors in oil and gas companies may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into other sectors, and institutional lenders may elect not to provide funding for oil and gas companies. Additionally, proponents of the Paris Agreement, including various state agencies and municipalities in California, and other governmental and non-governmental organizations concerned about climate change have sought to pressure public and private investment funds not to invest in oil and gas companies and institutional lenders to restrict oil and gas companies\u2019 access to capital. Recently, President Biden issued an executive order calling for the development of a \"climate finance plan\", and, separately, the Federal Reserve announced that it has applied to join the Network for Greening the Financial System, a consortium of financial regulators focused on addressing climate-related risks in the financial sector. Limitation of investments in and financings for oil and gas companies like us could result in the restriction, delay or cancellation of drilling programs or development or production activities.\nWe believe, but cannot guarantee, that our local production of oil, NGLs and natural gas will remain essential to meeting California\u2019s energy and feedstock needs for the foreseeable future. We have also established 2030 Sustainability Goals for water recycling, renewables integration, methane emission reduction and carbon capture and sequestration in our life-of-field planning in an attempt to align with the state\u2019s long-term goals and support our\nability to continue to efficiently implement federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies, including those relating to air quality and climate, in the future. However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to design, permit, fund and implement such projects in a timely and cost-effective manner or at all, or that we, our customers or end users of our products will be able to satisfy long-term environmental, air quality or climate goals if those are applied as enforceable mandates.\nThe adoption and implementation of new or more stringent international, federal, state or local legislation, regulations or policies that impose more stringent standards for GHG or other emissions from our operations or otherwise restrict the areas in which we may produce oil, natural gas, NGLs or electricity or generate GHG or other emissions could result in increased costs of compliance or costs of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for or the value of our products and services. Additionally, political, litigation and financial risks may result in restricting or canceling oil and natural gas production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages or other losses as a result of climate change, or impairing our ability to continue to operate in an economic manner. Moreover, climate change may pose increasing risks of physical impacts to our operations and those of our suppliers, transporters and customers through damage to infrastructure and resources resulting from drought, wildfires, sea level changes, flooding and other natural disasters and other physical disruptions. One or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse tax law changes may affect our operations.\nWe are subject to taxation by various tax authorities at the federal, state and local levels where we do business. New legislation could be enacted by any of these government authorities that could adversely affect our business. Legislation has been previously proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws, including the elimination of certain U.S. federal income tax benefits currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies. Such changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties; (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs; and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. However, it is unclear whether any such changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes would be effective. Additionally, legislation could be enacted that imposes new fees or increases the taxes on oil and natural gas extraction, which could result in increased operating costs and/or reduced demand for our products. The passage of any such legislation or any other similar change in U.S. federal income tax law could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development, or could increase costs and any such changes could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn California, there have been numerous state and local proposals for additional income, sales, excise and property taxes, including additional taxes on oil and natural gas production. Although such proposals targeting our industry have not become law, campaigns by various interest groups could lead to additional future taxes.\nEstimates of proved reserves and related future net cash flows are not precise. The actual quantities of our proved reserves and future net cash flows may prove to be lower than estimated.\nMany uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and related future net cash flows. Our estimates are based on various assumptions that require significant judgment in the evaluation of available information. Our assumptions may ultimately prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, reservoir data may change over time as more information becomes available from development and appraisal activities.\nOur ability to add reserves, other than through acquisitions, depends on the success of improved recovery, extension and discovery projects, each of which depends on reservoir characteristics, technology improvements and oil and natural gas prices, as well as capital and operating costs. Many of these factors are outside management\u2019s control and will affect whether the historical sources of proved reserves additions continue to provide reserves at similar levels.\nGenerally, lower prices adversely affect the quantity of our reserves as those reserves expected to be produced in later years, which tend to be costlier on a per unit basis, become uneconomic. In addition, a portion of our proved undeveloped reserves may no longer meet the economic producibility criteria under the applicable rules or may be removed due to a lower amount of capital available to develop these projects within the SEC-mandated five-year limit.\nIn addition, our reserves information represents estimates prepared by internal engineers. Although over 80% of our estimated proved reserve volumes as of December 31, 2020 were audited by our independent petroleum engineers, Ryder Scott and NSAI, we cannot guarantee that the estimates are accurate.\nReserves estimation is a partially subjective process of estimating accumulations of oil and natural gas. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows from those reserves depend upon a number of variables and assumptions, including:\n\u2022historical production from the area compared with production from similar areas;\n\u2022the quality, quantity and interpretation of available relevant data;\n\u2022commodity prices;\n\u2022production and operating costs;\n\u2022ad valorem, excise and income taxes;\n\u2022development costs;\n\u2022the effects of government regulations; and\n\u2022future workover and facilities costs.\nChanges in these variables and assumptions could require us to make significant negative reserves revisions, which could affect our liquidity by reducing the borrowing base under our Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, factors such as the availability of capital, geology, government regulations and permits, the effectiveness of development plans and other factors could affect the source or quantity of future reserves additions.\nAcquisition and disposition activities involve substantial risks.\nOur acquisition activities carry risks that we may:\n\u2022not fully realize anticipated benefits due to less-than-expected reserves or production or changed circumstances;\n\u2022bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties;\n\u2022assume liabilities that are greater than anticipated; and\n\u2022be exposed to currency, political, marketing, labor and other risks.\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we are often only able to perform limited due diligence. Successful acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties require an assessment of a number of factors, including estimates of recoverable reserves, the timing for recovering the reserves, exploration potential, future commodity prices, operating costs and potential environmental, regulatory and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and incomplete, and we may be unable to make these assessments with a high degree of accuracy. If we are not able to make acquisitions, we may not be able to grow our reserves or develop our properties in a timely manner or at all.\nPart of our business strategy involves divesting non-core assets. We regularly review our property base for the purpose of identifying nonstrategic assets, the disposition of which would increase capital resources available for other activities and create organizational and operational efficiencies. Our disposition activities carry risks that we may:\n\u2022not be able to realize reasonable prices or rates of return for assets;\n\u2022be required to retain liabilities that are greater than desired or anticipated;\n\u2022experience increased operating costs; and\n\u2022reduce our cash flows if we cannot replace associated revenue.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to divest assets on financially attractive terms or at all. Our ability to sell assets is also limited by the agreements governing our indebtedness. If we are not able to sell assets as needed, we may not be able to generate proceeds to support our liquidity and capital investments.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of pollution, environmental conditions or catastrophic events. We may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\nWe are not fully insured against all risks. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities and our assets are subject to risks such as fires, explosions, releases, discharges, power outages, equipment or information\ntechnology failures and industrial accidents, as are the assets and properties of third parties who supply us with energy, equipment and services or who purchase, transport or use our products. Pollution or environmental conditions with respect to our operations or on or from our properties, whether arising from our operations or those of our predecessors or third parties, could expose us to substantial costs and liabilities. In addition, events such as earthquakes, floods, mudslides, wildfires, power outages, high winds, droughts, cybersecurity, vandalism or terrorist attacks and other events may cause operations to cease or be curtailed and could adversely affect our business, workforce and the communities in which we operate. Further, recent wildfires experienced in California have limited the availability and increased the cost of obtaining insurance against certain natural disasters. We may be unable to obtain, or may elect not to obtain, insurance for certain risks if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented.\nInformation technology failures and cybersecurity attacks could adversely affect us.\nWe rely on electronic systems and networks to communicate, control and manage our exploration, development and production activities. We also use these systems and networks to prepare our financial management and reporting information, to analyze and store data and to communicate internally and with third parties, including our service providers and customers. If we record inaccurate data or experience infrastructure outages, our ability to communicate and control and manage our business could be adversely affected.\nCybersecurity attacks on businesses have escalated and become more sophisticated in recent years and include attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, malicious software, ransomware and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential information or the corruption of data. In addition, our vendors, customers and other business partners may separately suffer disruptions or breaches from cybersecurity attacks that, in turn, could adversely impact our operations and compromise our information. If we or the third parties with whom we interact were to experience a successful attack, the potential consequences to our business, workforce and the communities in which we operate could be significant, including financial losses, loss of business, litigation risks and damage to reputation. As the sophistication of cybersecurity attacks continues to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to further enhance our security.\nIncreasing attention to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters may adversely impact our business.\nOrganizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to evaluate their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward us and to the diversion of their investment away from the fossil fuel industry to other industries which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and costs of capital.", "PERMNO": 15029, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "CRCQQ"}
