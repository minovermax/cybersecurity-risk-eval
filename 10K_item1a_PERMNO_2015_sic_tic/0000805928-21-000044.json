RISK FACTORS\nOur business involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. The risk and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Set forth below is a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that management believes to be material to us.\nRisks Related To The Company\nOur revenue growth depends on our ability to increase distribution and sales to existing customers and develop new customers, domestically and abroad, and there can be no assurance that these efforts will result in significant increases in sales.\nBeginning in 2020, and in part as response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we adjusted our commercial strategy to focus on deeper penetration of our existing surgeon customers through the development of long-term users of Avance in our largest market opportunity of extremity trauma. Throughout the pandemic, we kept the sales team and broader commercial organization intact and took the opportunity to provide extensive sales training. Our sales team developed new skills and shared best practices for remote case support in hospitals where access was restricted. We believe this remote support has been appreciated by customers and has expanded the sales team\u2019s ability to support customers during COVID-19 and beyond. We believe that near-term growth can be supported first through expanded productivity of our existing sales force with existing customers and accounts and second by adding additional customers. We expect the number of direct sales professionals to increase over time. Additionally, we have successfully utilized a hybrid commercial approach that includes the use of independent agencies in more remote geographies in order to provide appropriate local support for customers, without the travel time required of a direct sales representative. We anticipate that we will continue to add to the number of independent sales agencies as it continues to drive higher productivity and efficiency with our direct sales force. We may also need to establish a regional distribution center or centers at some point in the future to account for growth. The incurrence of these expenses may impact our operating results, and there can be no assurance of their effectiveness. If we are unable to increase sales to existing customers and attract new customers, and develop our sales force, there could be a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nOur revenue depends primarily on five products.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is currently derived from five products, Avance Nerve Graft, Avive Soft Tissue Membrane, Axoguard Nerve Protector, Axoguard Nerve Connector, and Axoguard Nerve Cap for the treatment of peripheral nerve damage. Of these five products, Avance Nerve Graft represents approximately half of the Company\u2019s total revenue. Any disruption in our ability to generate revenue from the processing, distribution, and sale of products will have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nAvance Nerve Graft and Avive Soft Tissue Membrane processing consists of several steps and we use a number of recovery and/or acquisition agencies to supply the human tissue needed for these products. While we believe our current contracts and the ability to enter into future contracts will provide us with the tissues required for the products, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain the tissue that we need in the future. Disruptions in the tissue supply may adversely impact both tissue products and our overall business.\nAxoguard Nerve Connector and Axoguard Nerve Protector are only available through the Cook Biotech Distribution Agreement. The Distribution Agreement was amended February 26, 2018 to extend the termination date to June 30, 2027. However, there are conditions for continuation of the agreement, including payment terms and minimum purchase requirements, that if breached could result in an earlier termination of the agreement. Through mutual agreement, the parties have not established such minimums and to date have not enforced such minimum purchase provision. Additionally, in the event that we and Cook Biotech were to fail to reach an agreement as to minimum purchase quantities, Cook Biotech could terminate the agreement if it was deemed that we had failed to generate commercially reasonable sales of Axoguard as measured by sales similar to a competitive product at the same stage in its commercial launch as verified by a mutually acceptable third party. We distribute the Axoguard Nerve Connector and Axoguard Nerve Protector for Cook Biotech, and Cook Biotech is the contract manufacturer for our Axoguard Nerve Cap. Although we believe we could develop or obtain products that would replace the Axoguard products obtained through the Cook Biotech agreements, the loss of the ability to sell the Axoguard products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nOur success will be dependent on continued acceptance of our products by the medical community.\nContinued market acceptance of our products will depend on our ability to demonstrate that our products are an attractive alternative to existing or new nerve reconstruction treatment options, including both surgical techniques and products. Our ability to do so will depend on surgeons\u2019 evaluations of clinical safety, efficacy, ease of use, reliability, and cost-effectiveness, including insurance reimbursement, of our nerve repair products. For example, although our Avance Nerve Graft follows stringent safety standards, including sterilization by gamma irradiation, we believe that a small portion of the medical community has lingering concerns over the risk of disease transmission through the use of allografts in general. If the medical community and patients do not ultimately accept our products as safe and effective or we are unable to raise awareness of our products and processes, our ability to sell the products may be materially and adversely affected, and our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects may be adversely affected.\nWe have not consistently experienced positive cash flow from our operations, and the ability to achieve consistent, positive cash flow from operations will depend on increasing revenue from distribution of our products, which may not be achievable.\nWe have historically operated with negative cash flow from our operations. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $203.6 million. If revenue does not increase as anticipated, then we will continue to experience negative cash flows and adverse operating conditions. In June 2020, we entered into a seven year $70 million debt facility with Oberland Financial, the proceeds of which are expected to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. As our debt obligations mature or if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. If we raise funds by selling additional equity, such sale would result in dilution to our stockholders. There is no assurance that if we are required to secure funding, we can do so on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe are highly dependent on the continued availability of our facilities and could be harmed if the facilities are unavailable for any prolonged period of time.\nAny failure in the physical infrastructure of our facilities, including the facility we license from CTS, could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could reduce our revenue and harm our business reputation and financial results. Any natural or man-made event that impacts our ability to utilize our facilities could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. This includes termination of the CTS Agreement, which is set to expire on December 31, 2022, subject to earlier termination by either party at any time for cause (subject to the non-terminating party\u2019s right to cure, in certain circumstances), or without cause by us upon 6 months prior notice whereby such notice cannot be provided until March 1, 2021. We believe we can find and make operational a new licensed facility in less than six months, if required. In addition, we acquired property that is located near the CTS facility and it is expected that renovations will be completed by the termination date of the CTS Agreement to provide a new processing facility that can be included in our BLA for the Avance Nerve Graft. However, renovations and the regulatory process for approval of facilities whether licensed or owned is time-consuming and unpredictable. It could cause a significant disruption in service to our customers if we were to lose, even temporarily, the availability of our production or distribution facilities. In addition, we may plan to open additional office, lab or distributions space in the future, and our ability to license, renovate, rebuild or find acceptable service facilities takes a considerable amount of time and expense. Although we have business interruption insurance that would, in instances other than service agreement termination, cover certain costs, it may not cover all costs nor help to regain our standing in the market.\nTechnological change and competition for newly developed products could reduce demand for our products.\nThe medical technology industry is intensely competitive. We compete with both U.S. and international entities that engage in the development and production of medical technologies and processes including:\n\u2022biotechnology, orthopedic, pharmaceutical, biomaterial, chemical, and other companies;\n\u2022academic and scientific institutions; and\n\u2022public and private research organizations.\nOur products compete with autograft, hollow-tube conduits, commercially available wraps and amnion products, as well as with alternative medical procedures. For the foreseeable future, we believe a significant number of surgeons will continue to choose to perform autograft procedures when feasible, despite the necessity of performing a second operation and its drawbacks. In addition, many members of the medical community will continue to prefer the use of hollow-tube conduits due in\npart to their familiarity with these products and the procedures required for their use. Amnion products are widely available and we may not be able to distinguish the Avive Soft Tissue Membrane from such other products so as to produce significant revenue from its distribution. Also, steady improvements have been made in synthetic human tissue substitutes, which could compete with our products in the future. Unlike allografts, synthetic tissue technologies are not dependent on the availability of human or animal tissue. Although our growth strategy contemplates the introduction of new technologies, the development of these technologies is a complex and uncertain process, requiring a high level of innovation, as well as the ability to accurately predict future technology and market trends. We may not be able to respond effectively to technological changes and emerging industry standards, or to successfully identify, develop or support new technologies or enhancements to existing products in a timely and cost-effective manner, if at all. There can be no assurance that in the future our competitors will not develop products that have superior performance or are less expensive relative to our products rendering our products obsolete or noncompetitive. In this regard, Integra and Baxter each have or will commercialize a product consisting of a hollow tube conduit filled with material which they suggest is superior to their current hollow conduit products. Due to our limited resources, our smaller size and our relatively early stage, we may face competitive challenges from these new products or existing products and barriers that are difficult to overcome and could negatively impact our growth. Finally, a Chinese company provides a human peripheral nerve allograft in China, however, such product is not sold in our markets of interest because the protection afforded by our intellectual property.\nWe must maintain high quality processing of our products.\nOur Avance Nerve Graft is processed through our Avance Process, which requires careful calibration and precise, high-quality processing and manufacturing. Our Avive Soft Tissue Membrane is also human tissue that requires skill in its processing. Achieving precision and quality control requires skill and diligence by our personnel. If we fail to achieve and maintain these high levels of quality control and processing standards, including avoidance of processing errors, defects or product failures, we could experience recalls or withdrawals of our product, delays in delivery, cost overruns or other problems that would adversely affect our business. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of errors, defects or failures and could experience quality system issues where corrective actions must be taken. In addition, we may experience difficulties in scaling-up processing of our Avance and Avive products, including problems related to yields, quality control and assurance, tissue availability, adequacy of control policies and procedures, and lack of skilled personnel. If we are unable to process and produce our human tissue products on a timely basis, at acceptable quality and costs, and in sufficient quantities, or if we experiences unanticipated technological problems or delays in production, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects would be adversely affected.\nOur revenue depends upon prompt and adequate reimbursement from public and private insurers and national health systems.\nPolitical, societal, economic, and regulatory influences are subjecting the U.S. healthcare industry to fundamental change. The ability of a hospital or an ambulatory surgery center (\u201cASC\u201d) to pay fees for our products depends in part on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for either our products specifically, the procedures associated with the use of our products, or both. Providers that purchase our products generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs and fees associated with the procedures performed with our products or the products themselves. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including governmental payors such as Medicare and Medicaid, therefore, is important for obtaining product acceptance and widespread adoption in the marketplace.\nWhen our products (Avance Nerve Graft, Axoguard Nerve Connector, Axoguard Nerve Cap, Axoguard Nerve Protector, and Avive Soft Tissue Membrane) are used in the operating room of a hospital, they are commonly treated as general supplies utilized in surgery, and the cost is included in payment to the facility for the procedure. When Avance Nerve Graft and Axoguard Connector are used in an outpatient setting where the nerve repair is the primary reason for the procedure, facilities may use a Category I CPT code to facilitate payment.\nIn January 2018, the American Medical Association created a Category I CPT code (64912) specific to nerve repair with nerve allograft (Avance Nerve Graft) and a separate code (+64913) for each additional strand of allograft used in a procedure. Category I CPT codes are used by providers to facilitate payment to the provider (either hospital or ASC) for outpatient procedures. Additionally, Category I CPT codes are used to facilitate payment to the surgeon, for both time spent in outpatient and inpatient procedures. Prior to January 2018, there was no designated Category I CPT code for nerve repair cases that included nerve allograft. The Category I CPT code specific to nerve repair with nerve allograft, has allowed for nerve allograft repair cases to be uniquely identified in the Medicare claims data. This in turn allowed CMS visibility to nerve allograft nerve procedure costs, and thereby confirm nerve allograft qualified as a device intensive procedure.\nAnother important change in nerve repair reimbursement occurred in January 2020, when most direct repair procedures were moved to from the higher paying level 2 nerve repair Ambulatory Payment Category (APC) 5432 to the lower paying level 1 APC 5431, thus aligning payment rates more consistently with the lesser costs of a direct repair.\nAs a result of the allograft device intensive status and direct repair APC realignment, CMS reimbursement rates for nerve repair in the outpatient setting have changed significantly during the last two years. With the new 2021 CMS reimbursement rates for nerve repair in the outpatient setting that were effective January 1st, reimbursement for procedures using Avance have increased 25% in hospital outpatient centers and 97% in ambulatory surgery centers since 2019. During this same timeframe, reimbursement rates for procedures involving conduits and connectors also increased 25% in hospital outpatient centers and 45% in ambulatory surgery centers. While Medicare patients represent a relatively small percentage of trauma cases, CMS\u2019 direction often influences commercial payor policies and payments.\nThe process for securing coding for a product or procedure is separate from the process of securing coverage and establishing a reimbursement payment rate. In the U.S., coverage and reimbursement for medical devices vary among payors. In addition, payors review coverage policies on an ongoing basis and can, without notice, change or deny coverage for these new products and procedures. We estimate that commercial payors covering a significant number of U.S. covered lives have legacy non-coverage policies relating to our Avance Nerve Graft, Avive Soft Tissue Membrane, and our Axoguard product lines, designating these products investigational or experimental. Some commercial payors do not currently cover or reimburse our products because they have determined insufficient evidence of favorable clinical outcomes is available. Although some payors consider Avance Nerve Graft, Avive Soft Tissue Membrane, and our Axoguard product lines investigational or experimental at this time, these payors may in the future determine sufficient evidence has been developed to cover and reimburse our products and related procedures. In partnership with healthcare providers, we are actively working to reverse these non-coverage decisions and were successful with four regional plans in 2020. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be successful in these efforts. If we are not successful in reversing existing non-coverage policies, or if other third-party payors issue similar policies, this could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. Further, third-party payors who currently cover and reimburse customers for procedures using our products may in the future choose to decrease current levels of reimbursement or eliminate reimbursement altogether, either of which will cause our business to suffer.\nThe amount of reimbursement received by our customers from third-party payors is dependent generally on fee schedules established by these payors for the existing CPT codes. For governmental payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid, the fee schedule amount is determined by statutory and regulatory formulas as previously discussed. For commercial payors, the reimbursement amount generally is dependent upon the specific contract terms between the provider and payor. We cannot provide assurance that government or commercial payors will continue to reimburse for procedures with our products using the existing codes, nor can we provide assurance that the payment rates will be adequate. If providers and physicians are unable to obtain reimbursement for the procedure at adequate levels when use of our products is included, this could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. Hospitals and ASCs may not purchase our products if they do not receive payment sufficient to cover the cost of our products and related procedures. In addition, in the event that the current coding and/or payment methodology for these procedures changes, this could have a material effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nNegative publicity concerning methods of donating human tissue and screening of donated tissue, in the industry in which we operate, may reduce demand for our products and negatively impact the supply of available donor tissue.\nWe are highly dependent on our ability to recover human peripheral nerve tissue from tissue donors for our Avance Nerve Graft product and acquire birth tissue for our Avive Soft Tissue Membrane. The availability of acceptable donors is relatively limited, and this availability is impacted by regulatory changes, general public opinion of the donation process and our reputation for our handling of the donation process. Media reports or other negative publicity concerning both improper methods of tissue recovery from donors and disease transmission from donated tissue, including bones and tendons, may limit widespread acceptance of our Avance Nerve Graft and Avive Soft Tissue Membrane. Unfavorable reports of improper or illegal tissue recovery practices, both in the U.S. and internationally, as well as incidents of improperly processed tissue leading to transmission of disease, may broadly affect the rate of future tissue donation and market acceptance of allograft technologies and donated tissue use. Potential patients may not be able to distinguish our products, technologies, and tissue recovery and processing procedures from others engaged in tissue recovery. In addition, unfavorable reports could make families of our potential donors or donors themselves from whom we are required to obtain consent before processing tissue reluctant to agree to donate tissue to for-profit tissue processors. Any disruption in the supply could have a material impact for our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nDelays, interruptions or the cessation of production by our third-party suppliers of important materials may prevent or delay our ability to manufacture or process the final products.\nMost of the raw materials used in the process for Avance Nerve Graft and Avive Soft Tissue Membrane are available from more than one supplier. However, there are materials within the manufacturing and production process that come from single suppliers or certain supplies may be difficult to procure due to supply chain shortages or changes in global trade regulations.\nWe do not have written contracts that guarantee supply with any of our suppliers, and at any time they could stop supplying our orders. FDA review of a new supplier may be required if these materials become unavailable from our current suppliers. Although there may be other suppliers that have equivalent materials that would be available to us, FDA review, if required, could take several months or years to obtain, if able to be obtained at all. Any delay, interruption or cessation of production by our third-party suppliers of important materials, or any delay in qualifying new materials, if necessary, would prevent or delay our ability to manufacture products. In addition, an uncorrected impurity, a supplier\u2019s variation in a raw material or testing, either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturing process, or any other problem with our materials, testing or components, would prevent or delay our ability to process tissue. These delays may limit our ability to meet demand for our products and delay our clinical trials, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nThe failure of third parties to perform many necessary services for the commercialization of our products, including services related to recovery/acquisition, distribution and transportation, would impair our ability to meet commercial demand.\nWe rely upon third parties for certain recovery/acquisition, distribution, and transportation services for our products. If any of the third parties that we rely upon in our recovery/acquisition, distribution or transportation process fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or otherwise do not carry out their contractual duties, experience delays due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or encounter physical damage or natural disaster at their facilities, our ability to deliver product to meet commercial demand may be significantly impaired, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.\nWe are dependent on our relationships with independent agencies to generate a material portion of our revenue.\nWe derive material revenue through our relationships with independent agencies. In 2020 approximately 12% of global product revenue was generated through independent agencies. If certain agency relationships were terminated or discontinued for any reason, it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and profit. If we require additional agencies, we may not be able to find additional agencies who will agree to market and distribute our products on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are is unable to establish new agency relationships or renew certain current distribution agreements on commercially acceptable terms, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects could be materially and adversely impacted.\nIf we do not manage product inventory in an effective and efficient manner, it could adversely affect profitability.\nMany factors affect the efficient use and planning of product inventory, including donor tissue, such as effectiveness of predicting demand, effectiveness of preparing manufacturing to meet demand, efficiently meeting product mix and product demand requirements and product expiration. We may be unable to manage our inventory efficiently, keep inventory within expected budget goals, keep our work-in-process inventory on hand or manage it efficiently, control expired product or keep sufficient product on hand to meet demand. Finally, we can provide no assurance that we can keep inventory costs within our target levels. Failure to do so may materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nOur operating results could be adversely impacted if we are unable to effectively manage and sustain our future growth or scale our operations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our future growth efficiently or profitably. Our business is unproven on a large scale, and actual revenue and operating margins, or revenue and margin growth, may be less than expected. If we are unable to scale our production capabilities efficiently or maintain pricing without significant discounting, we may fail to achieve expected operating margins, which would have a material and adverse effect on our operating results. Growth may also stress our ability to adequately manage our operations, quality of products, safety, and regulatory compliance. Failure to implement necessary procedures, equipment or processes or to hire the necessary personnel in a timely and effective manner could result in higher costs or an inability to meet market demand, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. Additionally, our future growth will increase the demands placed on our third-party suppliers and there is no guarantee that our suppliers will be able to support our anticipated growth. If growth significantly decreases it will negatively impact our cash reserves, and we may be required to obtain additional financing, which may increase indebtedness or result in dilution to shareholders. Further, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, if at all.\nThere may be significant fluctuations in our operating results.\nSignificant quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations may be caused by, among other factors, our volume of revenue, seasonal changes in nerve repair activity, timing of sales force expansion, and general economic conditions. There can be no assurance that the level of revenue and profit, if any, we achieve in any particular fiscal period, will not be significantly lower than in other comparable fiscal periods. Our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations as to future revenue. As a result, if future revenue is below expectations, net income or loss may be disproportionately affected by a reduction in revenue, as any corresponding reduction in expenses may not be proportionate to the reduction in revenue.\nWe may be unsuccessful in commercializing our products outside the U.S.\nTo date, we have focused our commercialization efforts in the U.S., except for minor revenue in certain foreign countries. We intend to expand distribution and sales outside the U.S. and will need to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, including obtaining the requisite approvals to do so. The regulatory environment for our portfolio of products is complex. Avance Nerve Graft is distributed in Canada, the United Kingdom, and certain other countries. We received approval to distribute Avance Nerve Graft in Germany in December 2019. Avance use in Spain currently requires approval for each case to be approved by tissue authorities under an alternative therapies designation. Avive Soft Tissue Membrane is currently available in the U.S. and select other foreign countries. The Axoguard Nerve Connector and Nerve Protector CE has been renewed as of March 2020 by Cook Biotech.\nIn January 2020, the United Kingdom exited the E.U. (\u201cBrexit\u201d) following a transition period ending on December 31, 2020, which could disrupt trade between the United Kingdom and the E.U. or other nations, as the United Kingdom pursues independent trade regulations. We cannot be sure what changes could occur or the cost of regulatory compliance with both the United Kingdom and the E.U. going forward. Until such time as we can obtain, if at all, the necessary registrations and approvals for our products, material expansion beyond the U.S. will be limited. Finally, the cost of regulatory compliance for sales outside the U.S. can be significant and time consuming.\nFurther, we will need to either enter into distribution agreements with third parties or develop a direct sales force in foreign markets. If we do not obtain adequate levels of reimbursement from third-party payers outside of the U.S., we may be unable to develop and grow our revenue internationally. Outside of the U.S., reimbursement systems vary significantly by country. Many ex-U.S. markets have government-managed healthcare systems that govern reimbursement for medical devices, implants, and procedures. Some ex-U.S. reimbursement systems provide for limited payments in a given period and therefore result in extended payment periods. If we are unable to successfully commercialize our products internationally, our long-term growth prospects may be limited.\nWe incur costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we incur legal, accounting and other expenses to comply with relevant securities laws and regulations, including without limitation, the requirement of establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management devotes substantial time and financial resources to these compliance initiatives. Failure to comply with public company requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, activity by shareholders or others that bring into question aspects of our business, financial reporting or management\u2019s integrity, whether based on facts, beliefs or baseless and contrived for individual economic gain, can have a negative impact on the price of our stock and can result in substantial time and financial resources being expended to address the situation.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and capital investments.\nThe World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, and the virus continues to spread in areas where we operate and sell our products. COVID-19, or similar extraordinary events in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and capital investments. While the ultimate economic impact of COVID-19 cannot be reliably quantified or estimated at this time due to the uncertainty of future developments, COVID-19 will materially affect our near-term financial performance and, as a result, we suspended our 2020 financial guidance provided on February 24, 2020.\nIn response to COVID-19, several public health organizations have recommended, and some local governments have implemented, certain measures to slow and limit the transmission of the virus, including quarantines, \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d, and \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders, travel restrictions and business curtailments, among other measures. As a result, we believe that the reduced activities of the U.S. population due to the pandemic may reduce the incidence of traumatic nerve injuries. With respect\nto the medical industry in particular, COVID-19 has caused some hospitals and clinics to: (1) reallocate their teams and resources to prepare for increased COVID-19 patients; (2) defer or limit elective and non-emergency procedures; (3) restrict hospital access to non-essential personnel, including sales and clinical representatives not directly required for a specific procedure; and (4) limit or pause clinical research activities.\nSuch measures or others (including future measures implemented by governmental authorities and measures we have put in place or may in the future voluntarily put in place), as well as other effects of COVID-19, have had, and will continue to have, directly and indirectly, a material adverse effect on our business as they result in decreased demand for our product, decreased access to customer channels, slowing or stopping of the development of clinical products or clinical data, decreased employee availability, adverse economic conditions, potential border closures and other disruptions to our business, and the businesses of our business partners and others. Furthermore, COVID-19 may have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to the Regulatory Environment in which the Company Operates\nOur business is subject to continuing regulatory compliance by the FDA and other authorities, which is costly and could result in negative effects on our business.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by foreign and domestic government entities, including compliance with regulations governing appropriate relationships with healthcare professionals, such as physicians, hospitals and those to whom and through whom we may market our products. We are subject to various federal, state, and territorial laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we conduct business. These include, for example, anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, health care fraud, waste, and abuse laws, and anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Violations of these laws can be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the U.S., exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration health programs. These laws are administered and enforced by, among others, the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d), which issued new compliance guidance in 2020, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, state attorneys general, and their respective counterparts in the applicable foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Many of these agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years. There can also be changes to the regulations by foreign and domestic government entities that require us to update or upgrade business processes or to perform additional validation activities for product or processes. Compliance with such changes can be costly to implement or result in non-compliance, thus restricting the ability to distribute tissue or sell products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nOur products are also subject to regulation by the FDA in the U.S. The FDA regulates the development, preclinical and clinical testing, requirements for commercial marketing abd distribution, manufacturing and quality, safety, labeling, and promotion of human cell and tissue products (HCT/s), medical devices, and biological products. The FDA requires the approval of a biological product, like Avance Nerve Graft, through a BLA prior to marketing. Although the Avance Nerve Graft product has not yet been approved by FDA through a BLA, FDA is permitting the product to be distributed, subject to FDA enforcement discretion, provided that we: (1) transition to compliance with section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act, the cGMP regulations in 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211 and the applicable regulations and standards in 21 CFR Parts 600-610 prior to initiation of a phase 3 clinical trial designed to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of Avance Nerve Graft; (2) conduct a phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency of Avance Nerve Graft under an SPA; (3) continue to comply with the requirements of 21 CFR Part 1271; and (4) exercise due diligence in executing the transition plan. See \u201cBusiness - Government Regulations - U.S. Government Regulation Review.\u201d\nAvive Soft Tissue Membrane is processed and distributed in accordance with U.S. FDA requirements for Human Cellular and Tissue-based Products (361 HCT/P) and as such, complies with 21 CFR Part 1271 regulations, U.S. State regulations and the guidelines of the American Association of Tissue Banks (\u201cAATB\u201d). FDA could determine that Avive Soft Tissue Membrane should be regulated under Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act and cannot be marketed without a BLA. If so, FDA could take enforcement action including requiring that we remove the product from the market until a BLA is approved. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the FDA could also impose civil penalties, including fines, product seizures or product recalls and, in certain cases, criminal sanctions, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nThe FDA also regulates medical devices, for example the Axoguard products, and requires them to be cleared through the 510(k) premarket notification process prior to marketing. The FDA\u2019s premarket review process for new and modified existing devices that precedes product marketing can be time consuming and expensive. Some of the future products and enhancements to such products that we expect to develop and market may require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA.\nThere can be no assurance, however, that clearance or approval will be granted with respect to any of our device products or enhancements of marketed products or that our Avance Nerve Graft will meet FDA\u2019s requirements for continued marketing and transition to a BLA or ultimately an approved BLA. FDA review of our devices or biological products may encounter significant delays during FDA\u2019s premarket review process that would adversely affect our ability to market our products or enhancements. In addition, there can be no assurance that our products, including the Avance Nerve Graft, or enhancements will not be subject to a lengthy and expensive approval process with the FDA.\nIt is possible that if regulatory clearances or approvals to market a product are obtained from the FDA, the clearances or approvals may contain limitations on the indicated uses of such product and other uses may be prohibited. Product approvals by the FDA can also be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval. Furthermore, the FDA could limit or prevent the distribution of our products, and the FDA has the power to require the recall of such products. FDA regulations depend heavily on administrative interpretation, and there can be no assurance that future interpretations made by the FDA or other regulatory bodies will not adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. We, and our facilities, may be inspected by the FDA from time to time to determine whether it is in compliance with various regulations relating to specifications, development, documentation, validation, testing, quality control and product labeling. A determination that we are in violation of such regulations could lead to imposition of civil penalties, including fines, product recalls or product seizures and, in certain cases, criminal sanctions.\nThe use, misuse or off-label use of our products may harm our reputation, the image of our products, result in injuries leading to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business, or result in FDA sanctions.\nIf our products are misused or used for off-label purposes, our reputation and our product\u2019s reputation may suffer, injuries could occur, which may lead to product liability litigation, or we may be subject to FDA sanctions if we are deemed to have engaged in off-label promotion. We are seeking a biologics license through the BLA process for specific uses of Avance Nerve Graft under specific circumstances. Our promotional materials and training methods must comply with FDA requirements and other applicable laws and regulations, including the prohibition against off-label promotion. Our promotion of the Axoguard products, which are regulated as medical devices, also must comply with FDA\u2019s requirements and must only use labeling that is consistent with the specific indication(s) for use included in the FDA substantial equivalence order that results in marketing the devices. Avive Soft Tissue Membrane is processed and distributed in accordance with FDA requirements for (HCT/P) under 21 CFR Part 1271 regulations and is to be dispensed only by or on the order of a licensed physician and is contraindicated for use in any patient in whom soft tissue implants are contraindicated. The FDA does not restrict or regulate a physician\u2019s use of a medical product within the practice of medicine, and we cannot prevent a physician from using our products for an off-label use. However, the FD&C Act and the FDA\u2019s regulations restrict the kind of promotional communications that may be made about our products and if the FDA determines that our promotional or training materials constitute the unlawful promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify training or promotional materials and/or subject the Company to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, civil money penalties, seizure, injunction or criminal fines, and penalties. Other federal, state or foreign governmental authorities might also take action if they consider our promotion or training materials to constitute promotion of an uncleared or unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement, or exclusion from participation in federal health programs. In that event, our reputation could be damaged and our products\u2019 use in the marketplace could be impaired.\nThere may be increased risk of injury if physicians or others attempt to use our products off-label. Furthermore, the use of our product for indications other than those for which our products have been approved, cleared or licensed by the FDA may not effectively treat the conditions not referenced in product indications, which could harm our reputation in the marketplace among physicians and patients. Physicians may also misuse our products or use improper techniques if they are not adequately trained in the particular use, potentially leading to injury and an increased risk of product liability litigation. Product liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert management\u2019s attention from our primary business and result in substantial damage awards against us. Any of these events could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nOur Avance Nerve Graft product is currently allowed to be distributed pursuant to a transition plan with the FDA and a change in position by the FDA regarding its use of enforcement discretion to permit the sale of Avance Nerve Graft would have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe FDA considers our Avance Nerve Graft product to be a biological product, subject to BLA approval requirements. Although the Avance Nerve Graft product has not yet been approved by FDA through a BLA, it is currently distributed under the controls applicable to a HCT/P pursuant to Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and 21 CFR Part 1271 of FDA\u2019s regulations, subject to FDA\u2019s enforcement discretion and our compliance with a transition plan established by the FDA. See \u201cBusiness - Government Regulations - U.S. Government Regulation Review.\u201d We have continued to communicate with the CBER since the acceptance of the transition plan on clinical trial design, preclinical studies, Chemistry, Manufacturing, and\nControls (\u201cCMC\u201d) for Avance Nerve Graft, and other issues related to the effective IND. Subject to the FDA\u2019s enforcement discretion, we can commercially distribute Avance Nerve Graft until the FDA makes a final determination on an Avance Nerve Graft BLA submission, assuming we remain in compliance with the transition plan and exercises due diligence in executing the transition plan. In the event that the FDA becomes dissatisfied with our progress or actions with respect to the transition plan or the FDA changes its position for any reason regarding its use of enforcement discretion to permit us to distribute the Avance Nerve Graft product in accordance with the transition plan, we would no longer be able to distribute Avance Nerve Graft, which would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial viability. In addition, if we do not meet the conditions of the transition plan, or fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the FDA could impose civil penalties, including fines, product seizures, injunctions or product recalls and, in certain cases, criminal sanctions. These consequences also would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial viability.\nOur business is subject to continuing compliance to standards by various accreditation and registration bodies which is costly, and loss of accreditation or registration could result in negative effects on our business.\nWe are subject to accreditation such as that by the AATB and as a National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) Accredited Drug Distributors. We have registration requirements such as that with ISO 13485 registration bodies. These accreditations and regulations can affect distribution and sale of our products on a state-by-state basis, within the U.S. and also affects distribution and sale of our products outside of the U.S. The loss of accreditation or registration could keep us from selling and distributing our products, which may have negative effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nOur Axoguard products are subject to FDA and international regulatory requirements.\nOur Axoguard product line is regulated as a medical device in the US and international countries where we market Axoguard products. In the US, Axoguard product line is regulated under the FD&C Act and subject to premarket notification and clearance requirements under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act, 21 CFR Part 820 (Quality System Regulation) and other FDA regulations. In the rest of the world, each region (such as EU) or country has their independent international regulations such as the Medical Device Regulations (CE Mark) in Europe, UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), and Taiwan Pharmaceutical Affairs Act.\nWe distribute Axoguard Nerve Connector and Axoguard Nerve Protector products for Cook Biotech, and Cook Biotech is responsible for the regulatory compliance of these products. In the U.S., Cook Biotech has obtained a 510(k) premarket clearance for Axoguard Nerve Connector from the FDA for porcine (pig) small intestine submucosa for the repair of peripheral nerve transections where gap closure can be achieved by flexion of the extremity. Cook Biotech has also obtained a 510(k) premarket clearance for Axoguard Nerve Protector for the repair of peripheral nerve damage in which there is no gap or where a gap closure is achieved by flexion of the extremity. In countries where Axoguard is marketed, Cook Biotech has obtained regulatory clearance with the same indications except for Europe and UK. For the CE Mark, the Axoguard Nerve Protector indication is the same; however for Axoguard Nerve Connector, the indication is more specific - \u201cThe Axoguard Nerve Connector is indicated for the repair of peripheral nerve discontinuities with gaps up to 5 mm.\u201d\nWe are responsible for the regulatory compliance of the Axoguard Nerve Cap. We have obtained a 510(k) premarket clearance for Axoguard Nerve Cap to protect a peripheral nerve end and separate the nerve from the surrounding environment and to prevent or to reduce the development of symptomatic or painful neuroma.\nIf we or Cook Biotech fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the regulatory bodies in each country could deny or withdraw regulatory clearance/approval for the Axoguard products, or impose civil penalties, including fines, product seizures or product recalls and, in certain cases, criminal sanctions.\nDefective products could lead to recall or other negative business conditions.\nIf our products are defective or otherwise pose safety risks, the FDA could require their recall or we may initiate a voluntary recall of our products. The FDA may require recall of a marketed medical device product, such as the Axoguard products, in the event that it determines the medical device presents a reasonable probability of serious adverse health consequences or death. However, most device recalls do not rise to this level of health significance and result from voluntary action. The FDA has authority to recall biological products when a batch, lot or other quantity of the product presents an imminent or substantial hazard to the public health. However, in such circumstances, the FDA usually initially requests voluntary recalls of biological products, such as the Avance Nerve Graft. If a company does not comply with an FDA request for a recall, the FDA can order one under the above-referenced circumstances or take other enforcement actions, such as product seizure. In addition, manufacturers may, on their own initiative, recall a product to remove or correct a deficiency or to remedy a violation of the FD&C Act that may pose a risk to health. A government-mandated, government-requested or voluntary recall could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, reports of safety issues, failures, manufacturing errors,\ndesign or labeling defects or other deficiencies, and issues. Recalls and other field corrections for any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. A recall could adversely impact our reputation with customers and our sales. If the FDA were to disagree with our internal determinations and decision making relative to potential recalls (including corrections and removal), we could be subject to further regulatory or enforcement action against.\nIf our products cause or contribute to a death, a serious injury, or any adverse reaction involving a communicable disease, or malfunction in certain ways, we will be subject to reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions. See \u201cBusiness - Regulation - Education Grants, U.S. Anti-kickback, False Claims and Other Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws - Pervasive and False Claims.\u201d If we fail to report these events to the FDA within the required timeframes, or at all, the FDA could take regulatory or enforcement action against us. Any adverse event involving our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection, mandatory recall or other enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, would require the dedication of time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may adversely impact our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nOur operations must comply with FDA and other governmental requirements.\nOur operations require us to comply with the FDA\u2019s and other governmental authorities\u2019 laws and regulations on the topics including the manufacture and production and sales and marketing of medical products, and compliance efforts related to such laws is costly, and failure to comply could subject us to enforcement action. See \u201cBusiness - Government Regulations - Education Grants, U.S. Anti-kickback, False Claims and Other Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws - Fraud, Abuse and False Claims\u201d. Enforcement actions could impair our ability to produce products in a cost-effective and timely manner to meet customer demands. We may also be required to bear other costs or take other actions that may have an adverse impact on our future revenue and our ability to generate profits. Furthermore, our key material suppliers, licensors and or other contractors may not continue to be in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, which could result in our failure to produce products on a timely basis and in the required quantities, if at all.\nHealthcare providers and facilities, and third-party payors, often play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any currently marketed products and product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare providers and facilities, third-party payors and customers, and our sales, marketing and educational activities, may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations (at the federal and state level) that may constrain our business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, our operations are also subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse, and payment transparency.\nPayments made to physicians and other healthcare providers, and other financial interests, have been the subject of a range of federal and state laws. The federal physician payment transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, was created under the Affordable Care Act. The Sunshine Act, among other things, imposes reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments or other transfers of value made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians, other healthcare providers, and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an additional aggregate of $1 million per year for \u201cknowing failures,\u201d for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. As of 2021, applicable manufacturers are subject to tracking payments and transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other mid-level HCPs as well as physicians, with reporting relative to these mid-level practitioners beginning in 2022. Additionally, certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians and other HCPs.\nIn addition to the federal fraud, waste, and abuse laws noted, there are analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, and other state laws addressing the medical product and healthcare industries, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and in some cases may apply regardless of payor, i.e. even if reimbursement is not available. Some state laws require pharmaceutical or device companies to comply with the industry's voluntary compliance guidelines (the PhRMA Code and AdvaMed Code) and the relevant compliance program guidance promulgated by the federal government (HHS-OIG) in addition to other requirements, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nDistribution of our human tissue products outside the U.S. are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary from country to country. In the E.U., human tissue regulations, if applicable, differ from one E.U. member state to the next. Because\nof the absence of a harmonized regulatory framework and the proposed regulation for advanced therapy medicinal products in the E.U., as well as for other countries, the approval process for human derived cell or tissue based medical products may be extensive, lengthy, expensive and unpredictable. Our products are subject to E.U. member states\u2019 regulations that govern the donation, procurement, testing, coding, traceability, processing, preservation, storage, and distribution of human tissues and cells and cellular or tissue-based products. In addition, some E.U. member states have their own tissue banking regulations. The inability to meet foreign regulatory requirements could materially affect our future growth and compliance with such requirements could place a significant financial burden on us. As a result of Brexit, we cannot be sure what changes could occur or the cost of regulatory compliance with the United Kingdom. Accordingly, the cost of regulatory compliance for sales outside the U.S. can be significant and time consuming.\nFinally, regulations in both the U.S. and other countries are subject to constant change. There can be no assurance that we can meet the requirements of future regulations or that compliance with current regulations assures future capability to distribute and sell our products.\nClinical trials can be long, expensive and results are ultimately uncertain which could jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval and continue to market our Avance Nerve Graft product.\nWe are required to perform a clinical trial for our Avance Nerve Graft under FDA\u2019s statutory requirements to obtain approval of a BLA for the product. This trial is expensive, is expected to take several years to execute, is subject to factors within and outside of our control, and the outcome is uncertain.\nWe submitted an IND for the RECON study of Avance Nerve Graft in April 2013 and received FDA approval in March 2015. The phase 3 clinical trial was initiated in the second quarter of 2015. The RECON study was designed to assess the outcome of peripheral nerve repair in approximately 170 subjects in up to 20 centers. As required by the SPA and agreed to by FDA and us, an independent statistical analysis was conducted to determine if greater study enrollment was appropriate to maintain the planned statistical power of the study. Based on the results of this analysis, the study\u2019s independent biostatistician recommended continuation of the study with a one-time expansion in enrollment according to a pre-defined sample size re-estimation. The recommendation was reviewed with the FDA, and, on April 19, 2019, the FDA provided the company with a Revised Special Protocol Assessment Agreement that confirmed the expanded sample size and allowed the study enrollment target to be increased by 50 subjects, to a total target of 220 subjects and we may add up to five new study centers, for a total of 25 centers, to support enrollment and currently has 25 centers engaged. The study completed subject enrollment in July 2020. No outcome data is available at this time.\nWe are working to ensure compliance with the applicable regulations by having ongoing discussions on the transition of the quality system to 21 CFR Parts 210/211 and 600-610 regulations with the FDA. Final determination of regulatory compliance with 21 CFR Parts 210/211 and 600-610 will be made during FDA\u2019s pre-license inspection as part of the BLA review. The approval of our BLA would not occur or could be delayed, if the FDA is unable to agree with us, or we are unable to meet the standards required by the FDA regarding preclinical studies, clinical studies, and CMC.\nWe continue to work diligently with the FDA and, in this context, continue to distribute the Avance Nerve Graft products. The FDA will end the period of enforcement discretion upon a final determination of our BLA submission or upon a finding that we do not meet the conditions for the transition plan or are not exercising due diligence in executing the transition (e.g., not progressing toward study completion or BLA submission in a timely or adequate fashion). If final action on the BLA is negative or we are found to not meet the conditions for the transition plan, we will not be able to continue to distribute Avance Nerve Graft, and our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects will be materially adversely affected.\nThe results of non-clinical studies do not necessarily predict future clinical trial results and predecessor clinical trial results may not be repeated in subsequent clinical trials. Additionally, the FDA may disagree with our interpretation of the data from our non-clinical studies and clinical trials and may require the company to pursue additional non-clinical studies or clinical trials, or not approve our BLA. If we are unable to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product through our clinical trials, it will be unable to obtain regulatory approval to market the Avance Nerve Graft and will not be able to continue to provide it.\nWe will rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and they may not perform as contractually required or expected.\nWe will rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d), medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct our clinical trials and certain nonclinical studies. We and our CROs are required to comply with all applicable regulations governing clinical research, including good clinical practice (\u201cGCP\u201d). The FDA enforces these regulations through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators, CROs and trial sites. If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable FDA regulations, the data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our applications. We cannot be certain that, upon inspection, the\nFDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities will determine that our clinical trial complies or complied with clinical trial regulations, including GCP. In addition, our clinical trial must be conducted with product produced under applicable GCP regulations. Failure to comply with the clinical trial regulations, including GCP, may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. Further, if these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, need to be replaced, or the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our non-clinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we would not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our products on a timely basis, if at all, and our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects would be adversely affected. Furthermore, our third-party clinical trial investigators may be delayed in conducting our clinical trials for reasons outside of their control.\nU.S. governmental regulation could restrict the use of our Avance Nerve Graft and Avive Soft Tissue Membrane product, restrict our procurement of tissue or increase costs.\nIn addition to the FDA requirements for biological products, Avance Nerve Graft, and Avive Soft Tissue Membrane will continue to be subject to various requirements for human tissue under 21 CFR Part 1271. Human tissues intended for transplantation have been regulated by the FDA since 1993. In May 2005, three new comprehensive regulations went into effect that address manufacturing activities associated with HCT/P. The first regulation requires that companies that produce and distribute HCT/Ps register with the FDA. The second regulation provides criteria that must be met for donors to be eligible to donate tissues and is referred to as the \u201cDonor Eligibility\u201d rule. The third regulation governs the processing and distribution of the tissues and is often referred to as the \u201cCurrent Good Tissue Practices\u201d rule. The Current Good Tissue Practices rule covers all stages of allograft processing, from procurement of tissue to distribution of final allografts. Together, the three basic requirements of 21 CFR Part 1271 are designed to ensure that sound, high quality practices are followed to reduce the risk of tissue contamination and of communicable disease transmission to recipients. These regulations increased regulatory scrutiny within the industry in which we operate and have led to increased enforcement actions, which affects the conduct of our business. In addition, guidance was issued by the FDA in November 2017 and revised in July 2020 on Regulatory Considerations for Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products: Minimal Manipulation and Homologous Use which could have potential implications on the regulatory status of Avive and future HCT/P products being evaluated by the Company.\nAdditional regulations or guidance documents may be implemented by the FDA in the future. These changes may impose new documentation requirements, process changes or testing that could increase costs, and regulatory burden. See \u201cBusiness - Government Regulations.\u201d These regulations can also increase the cost of tissue recovery activities. Finally, Avance Nerve Graft and Avive Soft Tissue Membrane are subject to certain state and local regulations, as well as compliance with the standards of the tissue bank industry\u2019s accrediting organization, the AATB.\nThe procurement and transplantation of allograft nerve tissue is also subject to federal law pursuant to the National Organ Transplant Act (\u201cNOTA\u201d), a criminal statute that prohibits the purchase and sale of human organs used in human transplantation, including nerve and related tissue, for \u201cvaluable consideration.\u201d NOTA only permits reasonable payments associated with the removal, transportation, processing, preservation, quality control, implantation and storage of human nerve tissue. We make payments to certain of our clients and tissue banks for their services related to recovering allograft nerve and umbilical cord tissue on its behalf. If NOTA is interpreted or enforced in a manner that prevents us from receiving payment for services we render, or prevents us from paying tissue banks or certain of our clients for the services they render for us, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have engaged, through marketing employees, independent sales agents and sales representatives, in ongoing efforts designed to educate the medical community as to our products\u2019 benefits, and we intend to continue our educational activities. Although we believe that NOTA permits payments in connection with these educational efforts as reasonable payments associated with the processing, transportation and implantation of our products, payments in connection with such education efforts are not exempt from NOTA\u2019s restrictions and our inability to make such payments in connection with these education efforts may prevent us from paying our sales representatives and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. No federal agency or court has determined whether NOTA is, or will be, applicable to every allograft nerve tissue-based material that our processing technologies may generate. Assuming that NOTA applies to our processing of allograft nerve and umbilical cord tissue, we believe that we comply with NOTA, but there can be no assurance that more restrictive interpretations of, or amendments to, NOTA will not be adopted in the future, which would call into question one or more aspects of our method of operations.\nOther regulatory entities include state agencies with statutes covering tissue banking. Regulations issued by Florida, New York, California and Maryland, among other states, are particularly relevant to our business. Most states do not currently have tissue banking regulations. However, incidents of allograft related issues in the industry may stimulate the development of regulation in other states. It is possible that third parties may make allegations against us or against donor recovery groups or tissue banks about non-compliance with applicable FDA regulations or other relevant statutes or regulations. Allegations like\nthese could cause regulators or other authorities to take investigative or other action, or could cause negative publicity for our business and the industry in which we operate.\nOur Axotouch product is subject to FDA and other regulatory requirements.\nOur Axotouch product is regulated as a Class 1 510(k) exempt medical device under the FD&C Act and not subject to premarket notification and clearance requirements under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act, 21 CFR Part 820 (Quality System Regulation) and other FDA regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the FDA could require a 510(k) for the product, or impose civil penalties, including fines, product seizures or product recalls and, in certain cases, criminal sanctions, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nHealthcare law and policy changes may have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn the United States there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect our ability, or the ability of our collaborators, to profitably sell any products for which we obtain marketing approval. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we, or our collaborators, may receive for any approved products.\nSince enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010 there have been a number of legal challenges as well as other legislative and regulatory changes to the health care system that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. The full effects of the ACA may be unknown until all outstanding legal issues are resolved, the statutory provisions are fully implemented, and CMS, the FDA, and other federal and state agencies issue final applicable regulations or guidance. These developments could potentially alter coverage and marketing requirements, thereby affecting our pricing and market share if individuals lose coverage for certain benefits. The ACA remains subject to pending legal and constitutional challenges in the United States Supreme Court. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in California v. Texas on November 2, 2020. The Court has yet to issue its opinion, and we cannot say for certain what the decision will be or what impact, if any, it may have on our business.\nIn the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system. Executive Orders may be issued in the future that impact the healthcare system. Certain of these proposals could limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could also limit the acceptance and availability of our products. The adoption of some or all of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nAdditionally, initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector in the U.S. and elsewhere to limit the growth of healthcare costs, especially for drugs and biologics, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where we do business. We could experience an adverse impact on operating results due to increased pricing pressure in the U.S. and in other markets. Governments, hospitals, pharmacy benefit managers (\u201cPBMs\u201d), and other third-party payors could reduce the amount of approved reimbursement for our products, deny coverage altogether, or impose new requirements on manufacturers to justify their prices. Reductions in reimbursement levels or coverage or other cost-containment measures could unfavorably affect our future operating results.\nWe could be subject to civil or criminal penalties if we are found to have violated laws protecting the confidentiality of health information, which could increase our liabilities and harm our reputation or our business.\nThere are a number of federal and state laws protecting the confidentiality of certain health information and restricting the use and disclosure of that protected information. In particular, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services promulgated privacy rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d). These privacy rules protect medical records and other personal health information by limiting their use and disclosure, giving individuals the right to access, amend and seek accounting of their own health information and limiting most use and disclosures of health information to the minimum amount reasonably necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. If we are found to be in violation of the privacy rules under HIPAA, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities, harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nFailure to protect our intellectual property rights could result in costly and time-consuming litigation and our loss of any potential competitive advantage.\nOur success will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to successfully obtain and maintain patents, prevent misappropriation or infringement of intellectual property (\"IP\"), maintain trade secret protection, and conduct operations without violating or infringing on the IP rights of third parties. See \u201cBusiness - Intellectual Property.\u201d There can be no assurance that our patented and patent-pending technologies will provide us with a competitive advantage, that we will be able to develop or acquire additional technology that is patentable, or that third parties will not develop and offer technologies which are similar to ours. Moreover, we can provide no assurance that confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and other parties, agreements to protect trade secrets or similar agreements intended to protect unpatented technology or prevent unauthorized use, disclosure, or misappropriation will not be breached by those third parties. IP litigation is extremely expensive and time-consuming, and it is often difficult to predict the outcome of such litigation. A failure by us to protect our IP, or a breach by third parties of agreements aimed at protecting our IP, could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nFuture protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and may impact our ability to successfully compete in our industry.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain. We cannot ensure that:\n\u2022we, or our licensors, were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our patents;\n\u2022we, or our licensors, were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u2022any of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents;\n\u2022any of our issued patents or those of our licensors are valid and enforceable;\n\u2022any patents issued to us or our collaborators will provide any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties;\n\u2022we will develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u2022the patents of others will not have a material adverse effect on our business rights; or\n\u2022the measures we rely on to protect our IP underlying our products are adequate to prevent third parties from using, disclosing or misappropriating that IP, all of which could harm our ability to compete in the market.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability and the ability of our collaborators and licensors to avoid infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties, which could expose it to litigation or commercially unfavorable licensing arrangements. Third parties may accuse us or collaborators and licensors of employing their proprietary technology without authorization in our products, or in the materials or processes used to make our products. Any legal action against our collaborators, licensors or it claiming damages and/or seeking to enjoin our commercial activities relating to the affected products, materials and processes could, in addition to subjecting us to potential liability for damages, require us or our collaborators and licensors to obtain a license to continue to utilize the affected materials or processes or to manufacture or market the affected products. We cannot predict whether we or our collaborators and licensors would prevail in any of these actions or whether any license required under any of these patents would be made available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we were unable to obtain such a license, we and our collaborators and licensors may be unable to continue to utilize the affected materials or processes, or manufacture or market the affected products, or we may be obligated by a court to pay substantial royalties and/or other damages to the patent holder. Even if we were able to obtain such a license, the terms of such a license could substantially reduce the commercial value of the affected product or products and impair our prospects for profitability. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, the commercial value of the affected product or products or our prospects for profitability may be harmed as a result of any of the liabilities discussed above. Furthermore, infringement and other IP claims, with or without merit, can be expensive and time-consuming to litigate and can divert management\u2019s attention from our core business. We and our licensors may be unable to obtain and enforce IP rights to adequately protect our products and related IP, which could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.\nThe patent protection for our products may expire before we are able to maximize their commercial value which may subject us to increased competition and reduce or eliminate our opportunity to generate product revenue.\nThe patents for our commercialized products and products in development have varying expiration dates and, when these patents expire, we may be subject to increased competition and we may not be able to recover our development costs. For example, the material U.S. patents covering the formulations used in our Axoguard product line, which are held by Cook Biotech, have expired. Expiration of these patents could adversely affect our ability to successfully execute our business\nstrategy to maximize the value of Axoguard products and could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nOthers may claim an ownership interest in our IP which could expose us to litigation and have a significant adverse effect on our prospects.\nA third party may claim an ownership interest in one or more of our patents or other IP. A third party could bring legal actions against us claiming we infringed their patents or proprietary rights, and seek monetary damages and/or enjoin clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing of the affected product or products. While we believe we own the right, title and interest in the patents for which we or our licensors have applied and our other IP (including that which is licensed from third parties), and is presently unaware of any claims or assertions by third-parties with respect to our patents or IP, we cannot guarantee that a third party will not assert a claim or an interest in any of such patents or IP. If we become involved in any litigation, it could consume a substantial portion of our resources and cause a significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel. If any of these actions were successful, in addition to any potential liability for damages, we could be required to obtain a license to continue to manufacture or market the affected product, in which case we may be required to pay substantial royalties or grant cross-licenses to our patents. We cannot, however, assure that any such license will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations as a result of claims of patent infringement or violation of other IP rights, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. Further, the outcome of IP litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance, including the demeanor and credibility of witnesses and the identity of the adverse party. This is especially true in IP cases that may turn on the testimony of experts as to technical facts or the scope or meaning of patent claims upon which experts may reasonably disagree.\nWe depend on the maintenance of exclusive licenses.\nWe depend fundamentally on keeping and satisfying the terms of exclusive licenses of our nerve repair technologies from the University of Florida Research Foundation (the \u201cUFRF\u201d) and the University of Texas at Austin (\u201cUTA\u201d). Nonetheless, a disagreement between us and either licensor could have a negative impact on our ability to effectively operate our business. In addition, we could learn that the technologies we have licensed do not perform as purported, are not efficacious, or are not the property of the licensor, any of which would have an immediate and negative impact on our business.\nOur trademarks are valuable, and our business may be adversely affected if trademarks are not adequately protected.\nIn the U.S. and other countries, we currently hold trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending, any of which may be the subject of a governmental or third-party objection, which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the same. As our products mature, our reliance on our trademarks to protect our brand, increase our name recognition and, in part, differentiate us from our competitors increases. As a result, if our trademark applications are not successful and if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering or using trademarks, including trade dress, that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nAn active trading market in our common stock may not be maintained.\nThe trading market in our common stock has been extremely volatile. The quotation of our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market does not assure that a meaningful, consistent and liquid trading market will exist. We cannot predict whether an active market for our common stock will be maintained in the future. An absence of an active trading market could adversely affect our shareholders\u2019 ability to sell our common stock at current market prices in short time periods, or possibly at all. Additionally, market visibility for our common stock may be limited and such lack of visibility may have a depressive effect on the market price for our common stock. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 38.4% of our outstanding shares of common stock was held by our officers, directors, beneficial owners of 5% or more of our securities and their respective affiliates, which adversely affects the liquidity of the trading market for our common stock, in as much as federal securities laws restrict sales of our shares by these shareholders. If our affiliates continue to hold their shares of common stock, there will be limited trading volume in our common stock, which may make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares or increase the volatility of our stock price.\nThe price of our common stock could be highly volatile due to a number of factors, which could lead to losses by investors and costly securities litigation.\nOur common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cAXGN.\u201d The stock market in general, and the market for medical technology companies in particular, have experienced and could in the future experience extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The trading price of our common stock has experienced substantial volatility and is likely to continue to be highly volatile in response to a number of factors including, without limitation, the following:\n\u2022fluctuations in price and volume due to investor speculation, including short sales, social media speculation and other factors that may not be tied to our financial performance;\n\u2022our performance in the execution of our business plan;\n\u2022financial viability;\n\u2022actual or anticipated variations in our operating results;\n\u2022announcements of developments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022market conditions in our industry;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022adoption of new accounting standards affecting our industry;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022introduction of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market;\n\u2022regulatory developments in both the U.S. and foreign countries;\n\u2022performance of products sold and advertised by licensees in the marketplace;\n\u2022economic and other external factors;\n\u2022period-to-period fluctuations in financial results; and\n\u2022other events or factors, including the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations. Such fluctuations have and could expose us to securities class action litigation, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe operation and expansion of our business will continue to require funding. We do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law, and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. Accordingly, if any investor purchases shares of common stock, realization of a gain on such investment will depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in Minnesota law may deter acquisition bids for us that you might consider favorable.\nWe are governed by the provisions of Sections 302A.671, 302A.673 and 302A.675 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act (the \u201cMBCA\u201d). These provisions may discourage a negotiated acquisition or unsolicited takeover of us and deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to sell their common stock at a premium over the market price.\nIn general, Section 302A.671 of the MBCA provides that a corporation\u2019s shares acquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights unless voting rights are approved in a prescribed manner. A \u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d is a direct or indirect acquisition of beneficial ownership of shares that would, when added to all other shares beneficially owned by the acquiring person, entitle the acquiring person to have voting power of 20% or more in the election of directors.\nIn general, Section 302A.673 of the MBCA prohibits a public Minnesota corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of four years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested shareholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The term \u201cbusiness combination\u201d includes mergers, asset sales, and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested shareholder. An \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d is a person who is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of a corporation\u2019s voting stock or who is an affiliate or associate of the corporation, and who, at any time within four years before the date in question, was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the corporation\u2019s voting stock. Section 302A.673\ndoes not apply if a committee of our Board of Directors consisting of all of its disinterested directors (excluding current and former officers) approves the proposed transaction or the interested shareholder\u2019s acquisition of shares before the interested shareholder becomes an interested shareholder.\nIf a tender offer is made for our common stock, Section 302A.675 of the MBCA precludes the offeror from acquiring additional shares of stock (including in acquisitions pursuant to mergers, consolidations, or statutory share exchanges) within two years following the completion of the tender offer, unless shareholders selling their shares in the later acquisition are given the opportunity to sell their shares on terms that are substantially the same as those contained in the earlier tender offer. Section 302A.675 does not apply if a committee of our Board of Directors consisting of all of its disinterested directors (excluding its current and former officers) approves the proposed acquisition before any shares are acquired pursuant to the earlier tender offer.\nRisks Related to Financing Our Business\nOur credit facility and payment obligations under the Revenue Participation Agreement with Oberland Capital, contain operating and financial covenants that restrict our business and financing activities, require cash payments over an extended period of time and are subject to acceleration in specified circumstances, which may result in Oberland Capital taking possession and disposing of any collateral.\nOur credit facility with TPC Investments II LP and Argo SA LLC, each affiliates of Oberland Capital (collectively, \u201cOberland Capital\u201d), contains restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business. Under the terms of the credit facility, we must maintain, and cause our subsidiaries to maintain, certain covenants, including with respect to limitations on new indebtedness, restrictions on the payment of dividends and maintenance of revenue levels. Our credit facility is collateralized by all of our assets including, among other things, our intellectual property.\nIf we breach certain of our debt covenants and are unable to cure such breach, revert to the provided liquidity covenant or are not granted waivers in relation to such breach, it may constitute an event of default under the credit facility, giving Oberland Capital the right to require us to repay the then-outstanding debt immediately. If we are unable to pay the outstanding debt immediately, Oberland Capital could, among other things, foreclose on the collateral granted to them to collateralize such indebtedness. A breach of the covenants contained in the credit facility documents and the acceleration of its repayment obligations by Oberland Capital could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIn connection with the credit facility, we entered into a Revenue Participation Agreement (\u201cRPA\u201d) with Oberland Capital. Pursuant to the RPA, we agreed to pay an additional quarterly royalty payment as a percentage of our net revenue, up to $70 million in any given fiscal year, subject to certain limitations set forth therein, during the period commencing on the later of (i) April 1, 2021 and (ii) the date of funding of a loan under the credit facility, and ending on the date upon which all amounts owed under the Term Loan Agreement have been paid in full. Payments will commence on September 30, 2021 with the royalty structure resulting in approximately 1.0% per year of additional payments on the outstanding principal amount of the loans.\nThe credit facility and RPA could have important negative consequences to the holders of our securities. For example, a portion of our cash flow from operations will be needed to make payments to Oberland Capital and will not be available to fund future operations. Additionally, we may have increased vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions. Payment requirements under the credit facility and RPA will increase our cash outflows. Our future operating performance is subject to market conditions and business factors that are beyond our control. If our cash inflows and capital resources are insufficient to allow us to make required payments, we may have to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or seek additional capital. If we raise funds by selling additional equity, such sale would result in dilution to our stockholders. There is no assurance that if we are required to secure funding, we can do so on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe may need to raise additional funds to finance our future capital or operating needs, which could have adverse impacts on our business, results of operations and the interests of our shareholders.\nWe may need to seek to raise funds through the issuance of public or private debt or the sale of equity to achieve our business strategy. If we raise funds, this could dilute the interests of our shareholders. Moreover, the availability of additional capital, whether debt or equity from private capital sources (including banks) or the public capital markets, fluctuates as our financial condition and industry or market conditions in general change. There may be times when the private capital markets and the public debt or equity markets lack sufficient liquidity or when our securities cannot be sold at attractive prices, in which case we would not be able to access capital from these sources on favorable terms, if at all. We can give no assurance as to the terms or availability of additional capital.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nLegal proceedings that we become involved in from time to time could adversely affect our business operations or financial condition.\nWe are or may become involved in various legal proceedings, including, but not limited to, proceedings related to patent, product liability, shareholder or securities class actions, among other lawsuits. For example, as described in more detail in \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are currently a defendant in several securities class action lawsuits.\nLegal proceedings, if decided adversely to or settled by us, and not covered by insurance, could result in liability material to our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Likewise, regardless of outcome, legal proceedings could result in substantial costs and expenses, affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage and significantly divert the attention of our management. There can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in, or achieve a favorable settlement of, any pending or future legal proceedings to which we become subject. Even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees.\nWe may be subject to future product liability litigation which could be expensive, and our insurance coverage may not be adequate.\nAlthough we are not currently subject to any product liability proceedings and have no provision for product liability disbursements, we may incur material liabilities relating to product liability claims in the future, including product liability claims arising out of the usage of our products. Although we currently carry product liability insurance in an amount we believe is consistent with industry averages, our insurance coverage and any provision we may maintain in the future for product related liabilities may not be adequate and our business, results of operations, financial conditions, and prospects could suffer material adverse consequences.\nLoss of key members of management, who it needs to succeed, could adversely affect our business.\nOur future success depends on the continued efforts of the members of our executive management team. Competition for experienced management personnel in the healthcare industry is intense. If one or more of our executives or other key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, or if we are unable to attract and retain high quality executives or key personnel in the future, our business, results of operations, financial conditions, and prospects may be adversely affected.\nOur business and financial performance could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by natural or man-made disasters or other similar events.\nNeither the occurrence nor the potential impact of natural disasters (such as hurricanes and other natural disasters), civil insurrection and social unrest, public health crises, including COVID-19, nuclear disasters, terrorist activities, international hostilities or other criminal activities can be predicted. However, these occurrences could impact us directly as a result of damage to our facilities or by preventing us from conducting our business in the ordinary course, or indirectly as a result of their impact on our customers, suppliers or other counterparties. We could also suffer adverse consequences to the extent that these disasters affect the financial markets or the economy in general or in any particular region.\nOur ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of such occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our resiliency planning, and our ability, if any, to anticipate the nature of any such event that occurs. The adverse impact of natural or man-made disasters also could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or regional emergency responders or on the part of other organizations and businesses that we deal with, particularly those that we depend upon but have no control over.\nChanges in U.S trade policy, threats of international tariffs, and changes to the U.S. political landscape may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nAdditionally, rising threats of international tariffs, including tariffs applied to goods traded between the U.S. and China, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. Over the past several years, legislative and executive action from U.S. and foreign leaders has led to both threats of and the imposition of tariffs on certain materials and products. Throughout 2020 and 2019, the U.S. and China imposed tariffs or announced proposed tariffs to be applied in the future to certain of each other\u2019s exports. We have not been directly affected by the tariffs implemented by President Trump on the medical technology industry. We cannot be certain, however, if these tariffs will remain following the administration change or what impact, if any they may have on our business. Changes in political\nconditions in China and changes in the state of China-U.S. relations, including the current trade tensions, are difficult to predict and could adversely affect the operations or financial condition of the Company. We cannot predict the extent to which the U.S. or other countries will impose quotas, duties, tariffs, taxes or other similar restrictions upon the import or export of our products in the future, nor can we predict future trade policy or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements and their impact on our business. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and the U.S. economy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nWe may be subject to new and changing legislation, executive orders, and regulations as a result of President Biden. We cannot be certain as to how various policy changes from the Biden administration, including healthcare regulatory changes, may impact our business, results of operation, financial condition, and prospects. Volatile economic, political and market condition, such as social unrest, civil insurrection and political action, could adversely affect our business, results of operation, financial condition, and prospects.\nOur results of operations could be negatively affected by potential fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe are exposed to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We are exposed to the risk of an increase or decrease in the value of the foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar, which could increase the value of our expenses and decrease the value of our revenue when measured in U.S. Dollars. As a result, our results of operation may be influenced by the effects of future exchange rate fluctuations and such effects may have an adverse impact on our common stock price. Global markets and foreign currencies, including the Euro and the British Pound, were adversely impacted, as a result of Brexit and volatility in foreign currencies is expected to continue as a result of Brexit. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur regularly and, in some instances, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.\nOur failure to protect our technology systems and comply with data protection laws and regulations could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, and adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nWe rely on information technology systems, including technology from third-party vendors, to process, transmit and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. Similar to other companies, the size and complexity of our information technology systems makes them vulnerable to a cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards and the increasing need to protect patient and customer information. Any failure by us to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity, including from cyber-attacks, intrusions or other breaches, could result in the unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information, theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nIn the U.S., federal and state privacy and security laws require certain of our operations to protect the confidentiality of personal information, including patient medical records and other health information. Limiting and/or restricting the use of certain personal data and information, as well as added transparency obligations to data subjects is becoming an increasing focus as evidenced by the implementation of the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) which became effective on January 1, 2020. In Europe, E.U. member states and other foreign jurisdictions, including Switzerland, have adopted data protection laws and regulations which impose significant compliance obligations. Moreover, the collection and use of personal health data in the E.U. is governed by the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d). The GDPR imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the E.U. to the U.S., provides an enforcement authority and imposes large penalties for noncompliance, including the potential for fines of up to 4% of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company. The recent implementation of the GDPR has increased our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process, including in clinical trials, and we may in the future be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, which could divert management\u2019s attention and increase our cost of doing business.\nCompliance with applicable data privacy and security laws and regulations (together with applicable industry standards) may increase our costs of doing business. In this regard and in light of the CCPA\u2019s implementation, we expect that there will be other proposed laws, regulations and industry standards relating to privacy and data protection in the U.S., the E.U. and other\njurisdictions, and we cannot determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nWe are dependent on internal information and telecommunications systems, and any failure of these systems, including system security breaches, data protection breaches or other cybersecurity attacks, may negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nCyber-attacks and other tactics designed to gain access to and exploit sensitive information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations are constantly evolving and have been increasing in sophistication in recent years. High profile security breaches leading to unauthorized release of sensitive information have occurred with increasing frequency at a number of major U.S. companies, despite widespread recognition of the cyber-attack threat and improved data protection methods. While to date we have not experienced a significant data loss, significant compromise or any material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, our systems, those of our customers, and those of our third-party service providers are under constant threat. Cybercrime, including phishing, social engineering, attempts to overload our servers with denial-of-service attacks, or similar disruptions from unauthorized access to our systems, could cause us critical data loss or the disclosure or use of personal or other confidential information. Outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees to disclose personally identifiable information or other confidential information which could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information.\nWe are dependent on internal information and telecommunications systems, and we are vulnerable to failure of these systems, including through system security breaches, data protection breaches or other cybersecurity attacks. If these events occur, the unauthorized disclosure, loss or unavailability of data and disruption to our business may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and harm our relationships with vendors and customers. Additionally, these events may lead to financial losses from remedial actions, or potential liability from fines, including in relation to noncompliance with the GDPR, as well as possible litigation and punitive damages. Failures of our internal information or telecommunications systems may prevent us from taking customer orders, shipping products and billing customers. Sales may also be impacted if our customers are unable to access our pricing and product availability information. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur management has broad discretion in the use of our cash and cash equivalents and, despite management\u2019s efforts, cash and cash equivalents may be used in a manner that does not increase the value of shareholders\u2019 investments.\nOur management has broad discretion in the use of our cash and cash equivalents, and investors must rely on the judgment of management regarding the use of such cash and cash equivalents. Management may invest our cash and cash equivalents in short-term or long-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. These investments may not yield favorable returns to shareholders. If we do not invest or apply our cash and cash equivalents in ways that enhance shareholder value, we may fail to achieve expected financial results, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur business and stock price may be adversely affected if our internal controls are not effective.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that public companies conduct a comprehensive evaluation of their internal control over financial reporting. To comply with this statute, each year we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting and our management is required to assess and issue a report concerning it.\nAlthough we have systems in place to strengthen our internal control over financial reporting, we cannot assure you that we will not discover material weaknesses in the future or that no material weakness will result from any difficulties, errors, delays or disruptions while we implement and transition to new internal systems. The existence of one or more material weaknesses could result in errors in our financial statements, and substantial costs and resources may be required to rectify these or other internal control deficiencies. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly, we may be unable to obtain additional financing to operate and expand our business and our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects could be adversely impacted.", "PERMNO": 10966, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "AXGN"}
