{"cik": "804753", "company": "CERNER Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nCOVID-19 Risks\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response could materially adversely affect our financial condition, future bookings and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict. The COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread have significantly curtailed the movement of people, goods and services worldwide, including in most or all of the regions in which we sell our software, health care devices, technology-enabled services or other services (collectively referred to as \"Products and Services\") and conduct our business operations. It has caused us to modify our business practices, and we may take further actions as required by government authorities, our clients or as determined to be in the best interests of our associates, clients and business partners. These measures and our clients' focus on the pandemic have also resulted in delays in marketing, selling and implementing our Products and Services. There is no certainty that these measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed. The magnitude and duration of the disruption and resulting decline in business activity is uncertain. In particular, we have experienced and may continue to experience a negative financial impact due to a number of factors, including without limitation:\n\u2022Cerner's efforts and investments in assisting its clients in their response to the pandemic;\n\u2022Near-term declines in new business bookings as our clients focus on helping their patients during the crisis, rather than making new or expanded purchasing decisions, and longer-term declines in bookings for new Products and Services to the extent that the pandemic results in a sustained global or U.S. economic downturn;\n\u2022Delays in implementing our Products and Services, including delays in the pace of completion of existing projects, while client resources are reallocated or dedicated to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, and supply chain interruptions;\n\u2022Financial pressures being put on our clients, which may in turn result in a delay in collections or non-payment from our clients; and\n\u2022Financial pressures being put on our strategic investments for which we hold an equity interest increases the risk of asset impairment.\nAlthough we experienced some challenges in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, including declines in revenue related to project delays, at this time, we have not experienced a negative impact on our liquidity, access to capital or overall operations. While we generally expect the level of demand for our Products and Services negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to recover as we progress through fiscal 2021, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, including the nature and timing of when demand recovery may occur. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may experience material adverse impacts to our business as a result of the global or U.S. economic impact and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. There are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the COVID-19 pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the pandemic on our operations and financial results is highly uncertain and subject to change. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described below.\nCybersecurity and Information Technology Risks\nWe may experience interruptions at our data centers or client support facilities, which could interrupt clients' access to their data, exposing us to significant costs and reputational harm. We perform data center and hosting services for certain clients, including the collection and storage of critical patient and administrative data and the provision of support services. We rely on the secure electronic transmission, processing and storage of sensitive information, including protected health information; personally identifiable information; financial information; and other sensitive information relating to our clients and their patients, our company and our third-party suppliers. We also use public cloud providers and other third parties in connection with hosting our own data. A catastrophic failure of our backup generators during a prolonged public utility power outage; an impairment of telecommunications lines; a successful concerted denial of service attack; a significant system, network or data breach; damage, injury or impairment to the buildings, equipment, personnel operating such facilities or the client data contained therein; or errors by the personnel operating such facilities could cause a disruption in operations and negatively impact our clients. System redundancy, disaster recovery and other continuity measures may be inadequate. Any interruption, damage or breach of our systems or those of third parties on which we rely could damage our reputation, cause us to lose existing clients, hurt our ability to obtain new clients, result in significant revenue loss, create potential liabilities, increase our operating costs and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nA security breach could subject us to increased expenses, legal exposure and regulatory actions, and clients and prospective clients could be deterred from using our Products and Services. Our Products and Services require us to store, retrieve, process and manage our clients' information and data (and that of their patients), as well as our own data. Persons with authorized access, both associates and third parties, may use such access to harm the Company. Or persons outside of our organization may attempt to identify and exploit Product and Service vulnerabilities, penetrate or bypass our security measures, and gain unauthorized access to our software, hardware and cloud offerings, networks and systems, or those of our clients and suppliers, any of which could lead to disruptions in mission-critical systems or the unauthorized release or corruption of protected health information, personally identifiable information, financial information or other sensitive information, or the confidential information or data of Cerner, our clients or their patients, or our suppliers. We may be targeted by computer hackers because we are a prominent health care IT company and have high profile clients, including government clients. Additionally, our clients and their employees may be targeted by hackers who compromise their credentials and lead to unauthorized access of our systems. These risks may increase as we continue to grow our cloud offerings, collect, store and process increasingly large amounts of our clients' confidential data, including protected health information and sensitive personal data, and host or manage parts of our clients' businesses in cloud-based/multi-tenant IT environments. We also use third party public cloud providers in connection with certain client facing\ncloud-based offerings and to host our own data. There can be no assurance that our policies, procedures and controls or those of third parties on which we rely will detect or prevent all of these threats and we cannot predict the full impact of any such past or future incident.\nThe costs we would incur to address and remediate these security incidents would increase our expenses. Our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential clients that may impede our sales, development of solutions, provision of services or other critical functions. If a cyber-attack or other security incident were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of data or our IT systems, or if our Products or Services are perceived as having security vulnerabilities, we could suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation. This in turn could lead to fewer clients using our Products and Services and result in reduced revenue and earnings. These types of security incidents could also lead to lawsuits, regulatory investigations and claims and, in some cases, contractual costs related to notification and fraud monitoring. There can be no assurance that our cyber risk insurance will adequately cover all of our losses from any future security breaches or remain available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nOperating and Product Risks\nWe may be subject to claims for system errors and warranties or incur substantial costs related to product and service-related liabilities. Many of our Products and Services are intended for use in collecting, storing and displaying clinical and health care-related information used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients and in related health care settings such as registration, scheduling and billing. Our Products and Services, or the third-party software products or services incorporated therein, may contain design, coding or other errors, especially when first introduced. Similarly, errors in the implementation and configuration can occur and have occurred in the past. These errors could affect the ability of our Products and Services to properly function, integrate or operate with other offerings, scale to meet the needs of our clients, create vulnerabilities and adversely affect market acceptance. Our client agreements typically provide warranties concerning material errors and other matters. Our failure to meet these warranties could allow the client to terminate the agreement and possibly obtain a refund or damages or both, require us to incur additional expense to correct such failure, subject us to claims, damage our reputation and negatively affect future sales. We attempt to contractually limit our liability; however, these contractual limitations may not be enforceable or otherwise protect us from liability. We may also be subject to claims that are not covered by contract. There is no assurance that our liability insurance will adequately cover any claim or remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are uninsured or under-insured for any such claim, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed. Product and service-related claims, even if not successful, could damage our reputation, result in the loss of existing or potential clients, divert management's attention, result in significant revenue loss, create potential liabilities for our clients and us and increase our operational costs.\nOur proprietary technology may be subject to claims for infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights of others, or our intellectual property rights may be infringed or misappropriated by others or our software may be subject to claims related to open source software licenses. We rely upon a combination of confidentiality practices and policies, contractual arrangements and technical security measures to maintain the confidentiality and trade secrecy of our proprietary information. We also rely on trademark, copyright and patent laws to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite these efforts, we may not be able to adequately protect against theft, copying, reverse engineering, misappropriation, infringement or unauthorized use or disclosure of our intellectual property, which could have an adverse effect on our competitive position. In addition, we are occasionally involved in intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims. These claims, even if unmeritorious, are expensive to defend and are often incapable of prompt resolution. If we are unsuccessful in defending these claims, we could be required to pay a substantial damage award, develop alternative technology, obtain a license or cease using, selling, offering for sale, licensing, implementing or supporting the applicable Products and Services. We rely upon open source software in our Products and Services. We may encounter claims alleging unauthorized use of the software purported to be licensed under open source terms, demanding release of derivative works of open source software that could include our proprietary source code, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source licenses. These claims could result in litigation and, even if unmeritorious, could be expensive to defend and incapable of prompt resolution. We could also be required to make our software source code available under the applicable open source license, utilize or develop alternative technology, or cease using, selling or supporting the applicable Products and Services if we are unsuccessful in defending such claims.\nWe may become involved in legal proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and our inability or failure to effectively manage publicity related to such claims or legal proceedings could adversely impact our business. From time to time and in the ordinary course of our business, we may become involved in various legal proceedings and claims, including for example, those relating to employment practices, solution and implementation defects, personal injury, torts, intellectual property infringement, violations of law and breaches of contract and warranties. All disputes and legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable. And, regardless of the merits of the claims, litigation may lead to negative publicity and may be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and distracting to management. If resolved against us, legal proceedings could result in excessive judgments, injunctive relief or other equitable relief that may affect how we operate our business. Any settlements of disputes or legal proceedings may also affect how we operate our business. There can be no assurance that our liability insurance will adequately cover any judgment or settlement or remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. If we incur liability that exceeds our insurance coverage or that is not within the scope of the coverage, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, the dissemination of information via social media, including information about alleged harassment, discrimination or other claims, could harm our business, brand, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations, regardless of the information's accuracy.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our global operations. We market, sell and support our Products and Services globally. We periodically evaluate entering into new markets and adjusting our focus in certain existing markets. Significant management attention and financial resources could be required to address the risks noted below associated with new market entry into non-U.S. markets and potential disruptions if we chose to adjust our focus in a given market. Non-U.S. operations are subject to inherent risks, and our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability, could be adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors. These include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022Greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;\n\u2022Difficulties and costs of staffing and managing non-U.S. operations and labor disruptions;\n\u2022Effects of sovereign debt conditions, including budgetary constraints, or health service provider or government spending patterns or government-imposed austerity measures;\n\u2022Legal compliance costs or business risks associated with our global operations, such as: i) local laws and customs differing from, or more stringent than those in the United States, such as those relating to data protection and data security, trade protection measures and intellectual property rights, ii) heightened risk with respect to laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery, including without limitation the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act and similar laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions, iii) export control regulations, iv) different or additional functionality requirements or preferences, or v) certification (e.g. CE marking for medical device software), licensing or regulatory requirements and unexpected changes to those requirements;\n\u2022The United Kingdom's withdrawal of its membership from the European Union (\"EU\"), which is commonly referred to as \"Brexit\" and associated uncertainty and disruptions relating thereto;\n\u2022Natural disasters, war, terrorist acts or political unrest which may impact sales or threaten the safety of associates or our continued presence in these countries and the related potential impact on global stability; and\n\u2022Our ability to form relationships with local partners, which help us to offer our Products and Services at scale, and our reliance on these partners whose reputation may not be regarded as highly outside the United States.\nWe operate in intensely competitive and dynamic industries, and our ability to successfully compete depends on our ability to anticipate or respond quickly to market changes and to bring competitive new Products and Services and features to market in a timely fashion. The market for our Products and Services is intensely competitive, dynamically evolving and subject to rapid technological advances and innovative enhancements, changing delivery and pricing models, evolving standards in computer hardware and software development and communications infrastructure, and changing and increasingly sophisticated client needs. Development of new proprietary Products or Services is complex, entails significant time and expense, may not be successful and often involves a long return on investment cycle. We cannot guarantee that the market for our Products and Services will continue to grow or that we will be able to successfully introduce new Products or Services. We provide solutions to clients via various deployment models, including client-server-based solutions and cloud-based offerings. As we move more of our offerings to the cloud, we may incur disruption as we transition existing clients and be less competitive during the transition, which could impact revenue and profitability. We believe we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position; and oftentimes, successful investments require several years before generating significant revenue.\nIn addition, we expect that major software information systems companies, highly capitalized consumer technology companies, large information technology consulting service providers and system integrators, start-up companies and others operating in the health care industry may offer competitive Products and Services. As we continue to develop new Products and Services to address areas such as analytics, machine learning (\"ML\"), artificial intelligence (\"AI\"), value-based care, consumer solutions, population health management and other health network solutions, we expect to face new competitors, and these competitors may have more experience in these markets, better brand recognition or more established relationships with prospective clients. We face strong competition and often face downward price pressure, which could adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity. If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in use of our Products and Services or changes in client demand, our revenues could decrease.\nOur success also depends on our ability to maintain and expand our business with our existing clients and effectively transition existing clients to current Products and Services, as well as attracting additional clients. Certain clients originally purchased one or a limited number of our Products and Services. These clients may choose not to expand their use of or purchase new Products and Services. Failure to retain and generate additional business from our current clients could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, there are a limited number of hospitals and other health care providers in the U.S. market, and the health care industry has been subject to increasing consolidation, which can cause fewer new footprint opportunities or lead to the replacement of our Products and Services in existing clients if the acquiror (or the group being acquired) has a relationship with a different Health Information Technology (HIT) provider. If we are unable to adapt to the impact of industry consolidation, falling costs and technological advancements in a timely manner, our prospects and financial results could be negatively affected.\nWe intend to continue strategic business acquisitions and to make strategic investments, which are subject to inherent risks. In order to expand our Products and Services offerings and grow our market and client base, we may continue to seek and complete strategic business acquisitions and investments that we believe are complementary to our business. Acquisitions and strategic investments have inherent risks which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects, including, but not limited to: 1) diversion of our management's attention; 2) investment in or entry into markets in which we have little or no direct prior experience; 3) failure to achieve projected synergies; 4) failure to commercialize \"go forward\" Products and Services; 4) failure to successfully integrate the business; 5) loss of clients, key personnel, suppliers and other important relationships; 6) incurrence of debt or assumption of known and unknown liabilities; 7) write-off of software development costs, goodwill, client lists and amortization of expenses related to intangible assets; 8) dilutive issuances of equity securities; 9) accounting deficiencies relating to the acquisition of an acquired company, including issues related to internal control over financial reporting and the time and cost associated with remedying such deficiencies; and 10) litigation related to acquisition activity. Further, when we make a strategic investment, we have to rely on third party management teams to drive the portfolio company's success and at times infuse additional capital or provide bridge loans to protect our investment. If we fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses or fail to implement our business strategies with respect to our acquisitions or investments, we may not be able to achieve projected results or support the amount of consideration paid for such acquired businesses or invested into a portfolio company.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth in the new markets in which we offer Products and Services, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer. Our future financial results will depend on our ability to profitably manage our business in the new markets that we enter. We expect to pursue growth and expansion opportunities in the areas of analytics, ML, AI, value-based care, consumer solutions, population health and other health network solutions. To achieve success in those areas, we will need to, among other things, recruit, train, retain and effectively manage associates, manage changing business conditions and implement and improve our technical, administrative, financial control and reporting systems for offerings in those areas. Difficulties in managing future growth in new markets could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLong sales cycles for our Products and Services could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. Some of our Products and Services have long sales cycles, ranging from several months to eighteen months or more beginning at initial contact with the client through execution of a contract. Implementing, replacing, or expanding an information system, or modifying, adding or outsourcing business processes, are major decisions for health care organizations. Many of the Products and Services we provide require a substantial capital investment and time commitments by the client or prospective client. Any decision by our clients or prospective clients to delay a purchasing decision could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe depend on strategic relationships and third-party suppliers and our revenue and operating earnings could suffer if we fail to manage these relationships properly. To be successful, we must continue to maintain our existing strategic relationships and establish additional strategic relationships as necessary with leaders in the markets in which we operate. As we decide to partner rather than directly provide certain Products and Services, we will become more dependent on these strategic relationships to meet our clients' needs. We believe that these relationships contribute to our ability to further build our brand, extend the reach of our Products and Services, develop and deploy new products and services, and generate additional revenues and cash flows. The loss of a critical strategic relationship or failure to establish additional relationships, or the failure to realize anticipated synergies and benefits of these strategic relationships, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe license or purchase certain intellectual property and technology (such as software, services, hardware and content) from third parties, including some competitors, and depend on such intellectual property and technology in the operation and delivery of our Products and Services. Additionally, we sell or license third party intellectual property and technology in conjunction with our Products and Services. Our remote hosting and cloud services businesses also rely on a limited number of software and services suppliers for certain functions of these businesses. Most of our third-party software license support contracts expire within one to five years, can be renewed only by mutual consent and may be terminated if we breach the terms of the license and fail to cure the breach within a specified period of time. Most of these third-party software licenses are non-exclusive; therefore, our competitors may obtain the right to use the technology covered by these licenses to compete directly with us. If our third party suppliers were to change product offerings, cease actively supporting the technologies, fail to update and enhance the technologies, encounter technical difficulties in developing these technologies, significantly increase prices, change delivery models, terminate our licenses or supply contracts or suffer significant capacity or supply chain constraints or disruptions, we may need to seek alternative suppliers and incur additional internal or external development costs to ensure continued performance of our Products and Services. Such alternatives may not be available on attractive terms or may not be as widely accepted or as effective as the intellectual property or technology provided by our existing suppliers. In addition, interruption in functionality of our Products and Services as a result of changes in third party suppliers could adversely affect our commitments to clients, future sales of Products and Services, and negatively affect our revenue and operating earnings.\nOur success depends upon the recruitment and retention of key personnel. Members of our senior management team and other key personnel have departed the Company during the past few years for a variety of reasons, and we cannot guarantee that there will not be additional departures. To remain competitive, we must attract, motivate and retain highly skilled managerial, sales, marketing, consulting and technical personnel, including key personnel skilled in the industries and technical environments in which our Products and Services are offered. As we modernize our core platforms to the cloud, it is important that we retain and attract experienced technical talent with cloud expertise to lead this transformation. Competition for such personnel in our industries is intense in both the United States and abroad. Our failure to attract additional qualified personnel and to retain and motivate existing personnel to meet our needs could have a material adverse effect on our prospects for long-term growth. We may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales. The unexpected loss of key personnel, or the failure to successfully develop and execute effective succession planning to assure smooth transitions of those key associates and their knowledge, relationships and expertise, could disrupt our business and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition, and could potentially inhibit development and delivery of our Products and Services and market share advances.\nWe might not be successful in achieving expected operating efficiencies and sustaining or improving operating expense reductions and might experience business disruptions and adverse tax consequences associated with restructuring, realignment and cost reduction activities. Cerner has implemented and plans to continue to implement several restructuring and realignment initiatives to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. There can be no assurance that we will realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits of these initiatives. If we are unable to deliver on these initiatives, while continuing to invest in business growth, or if the volume and nature of change overwhelms available resources, our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted. Our ability to successfully manage and execute these initiatives and realize expected savings and benefits in the amounts and at the times anticipated is important to our business success. Any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, our ability to achieve our other strategic goals and business plans might be adversely affected and we could experience business disruptions with clients and elsewhere if our restructuring and realignment efforts and our cost reduction activities prove ineffective.\nRegulatory Risks\nThe health care industry is subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences, which could impact the purchasing practices and operations of our clients and increase our costs to deliver Products and Services that enable our clients to meet their compliance requirements. Many health care providers are consolidating to create integrated health care delivery systems with greater market power. These providers may try to use their market power to negotiate price reductions for our Products and Services. As the health care industry consolidates, our client base could be consolidated with fewer buyers, competition for clients could become more intense and the importance of maintaining and acquiring new client relationships becomes greater.\nThe last five years have been quite active legislatively with major statutes such as the Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA) of 2014 establishing requirements for \"Appropriate Use Criteria\" in ordering high dollar diagnostic imaging services, the Medicare and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 which reformed how physicians are paid under Medicare and which established the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS); the 21st Century Cures Act of 2016 (Cures Act), which laid the groundwork for a nationwide trusted health information exchange, established interoperability requirements for providers, payers and consumers, and set the framework for information blocking regulations; and most recently the Substance Use Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities (SUPPORT) Act of 2018 that includes significant policies for addressing the opioid crisis. These statutes are heavily laden with provisions that directly call for or describe roles for the use of health information technology to help providers comply with new federal requirements under Medicare and state Medicaid programs.\nReform of payment policies for Medicare and Medicaid continues to evolve. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act became law in 2010; this comprehensive health care reform legislation introduced value-based principles into federal health insurance payments systems, sought to improve health care quality, and expanded access to affordable health insurance. MACRA built upon the value based policies introduced by the ACA. These legislative initiatives accelerated the adoption of \"Alternative Payment Models\" (APMs) as bundled payment models based on episodes of care or per capita payment for defined populations as alternatives to traditional fee for service payments to providers. New APMs continue to be developed under the authorities of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovations, and value-based efforts such as the Medicare Shared Savings Program Accountable Care Organization (MSSP ACO) program or Bundled Payment for Care Improvement (BPCI) advanced episode-based payment model program have seen their second iteration. APMs have evolved to usually require two-sided risk (shared saving and shared losses) and use of Certified EHR Technology (CEHRT) as a precondition for program participation. However, even after failed attempts to repeal the ACA, continuing challenges in the courts create uncertainty for the continued implementation of the ACA. Given a fractious and polarized legislative environment at the federal level, the near-term prospects for health care related legislation face uncertainty. Because of ongoing federal fiscal budgetary pressures yet to be resolved for federal health programs, we cannot predict the full effect of health care legislation on our business at this time. The direction and pace of health care reform initiatives may adversely impact either our operational results or the way we operate our business. We also anticipate significant impacts from information blocking provisions of the Cures Act and its enabling regulations, which includes mandated adoption of new certified capabilities and updates to support new interoperability requirements as a part of required use of certified HIT. We expect expanded surveillance by federal agencies of certified HIT and its use by our clients. We also anticipate newly expanded regulations under the federal Self-Referral and Anti-Kickback Laws that will contain expanded safe harbors for value based care, and that may promote expanded donation of certified HIT and of cybersecurity technologies in support of trusted health information exchange to support coordinated patient care within value based APMs. In response to this uncertainty, purchasers of HIT may elect to update HIT already in use and postpone investment decisions in new or replacement HIT, including investments in our Products and Services. Future legislation and regulation together with future judicial decisions may ultimately impact the fiscal stability and sustainability of HIT purchasers. Differences in demand related to new regulatory requirements and near-term compliance deadlines that contribute to demand for our Products and Services could impact our financial results. There can be no certainty that any legislation that may be adopted or judicial decisions will be favorable to our business. We cannot predict whether or when future health care reform initiatives at the federal or state level or other initiatives affecting our business will be proposed, enacted or implemented or what impact those initiatives may have on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe health care industry is highly regulated, and thus, we are subject to several laws, regulations and industry initiatives, non-compliance with certain of which could materially adversely affect our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. As a participant in the health care industry, our operations and relationships, and those of our clients, are regulated by several U.S. federal, state, local and foreign governmental entities. The impact of these regulations on us is both direct, to the extent that we are ourselves\nsubject to these laws and regulations, and also indirect, in terms of government program requirements applicable to our clients for the use of HIT. Even though we may not be directly regulated by specific health care laws and regulations, our Products and Services must be capable of being used by our clients in a way that complies with those laws and regulations. There are a significant and wide-ranging number of regulations both within the United States and abroad, such as regulations in the areas of health care fraud, information blocking, e-prescribing, claims processing and transmission, health care devices, the security and privacy of patient data and interoperability standards, that may be directly or indirectly applicable to our operations and relationships or the business practices of our clients. Specific risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\nHealth Care Fraud. U.S. federal and state governments continue to enhance regulation of and increase their scrutiny over practices involving health care fraud, waste and abuse perpetuated by health care providers and professionals whose services are reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and other government health care programs. Our health care provider clients, as well as our provision of Products and Services to government entities, subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which, among other things, prohibit the direct or indirect payment or receipt of any remuneration for patient referrals, or arranging for or recommending referrals or other business paid for in whole or in part by these federal or state health care programs. U.S. federal enforcement personnel have substantial funding, powers and remedies to pursue suspected or perceived fraud and abuse. The effect of this government regulation on our clients is difficult to predict. Many of the regulations applicable to our clients and that may be applicable to us, including those relating to marketing incentives offered in connection with health care device sales and information blocking, are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts. They may be interpreted or applied by prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authorities in a manner that could broaden their applicability to us or require our clients to make changes in their operations or the way in which they deal with us. If we fail to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties, sanctions or other liability, including exclusion from government health programs or from providing certain Products and Services to our clients who participate in such programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even an unsuccessful challenge by a regulatory or prosecutorial authority of our activities could result in adverse publicity, require a costly response from us and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPreparation, Transmission, Submission and Collection of Medical Claims for Reimbursement. Our Products and Services are capable of electronically transmitting claims for services and items rendered by a physician to many patients' payers for approval and reimbursement. Such claims are governed by U.S. federal and state laws. U.S. federal law provides civil liability to any persons that knowingly submit, or cause to be submitted, a claim to a payer, including Medicare, Medicaid and private health plans, seeking payment for any services or items that overbills or bills for services or items that have not been provided to the patient. U.S. federal law may also impose criminal penalties for intentionally submitting such false claims. In addition, federal and state law regulates the collection of debt and may impose monetary penalties for violating those regulations. We have policies and procedures in place that we believe result in the accurate and complete preparation, transmission, submission and collection of claims, provided that the information given to us by our clients is also accurate and complete. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"HIPAA\") security, privacy and transaction standards, as discussed below, also have a potentially significant effect on our claims preparation, transmission and submission services, because those services must be structured and provided in a way that supports our clients' HIPAA compliance obligations. In connection with these laws, we may be subjected to U.S. federal or state government investigations and possible penalties may be imposed upon us; false claims actions may have to be defended; private payers may file claims against us; and we may be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid or other government-funded health care programs. Any investigation or proceeding related to these laws, even if unwarranted or without merit, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRegulation of Health Care Devices. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") has determined that certain of our Products and Services are covered medical devices that are actively regulated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (\"Act\") and amendments to the Act. Other countries have similar regulations in place related to medical devices, that now or may in the future apply to certain of our Products and Services. If other of our Products and Services are deemed to be actively regulated medical devices by the FDA or similar regulatory agencies in countries where we do business, we could be subject to extensive requirements governing pre- and post-marketing activities including pre-market notification clearance. Complying with these medical device regulations globally is time consuming and expensive and could be subject to unanticipated and significant delays. Further, it is possible that these regulatory agencies may become more active in regulating software and devices that are used in health care. If we are unable to obtain the required regulatory approvals for any such Products and Services, our short- and long-term business plans for these Products and Services could be delayed or canceled. Our sites have been previously subject to FDA inspections, and we remain subject to periodic FDA inspections. We could be required to undertake additional actions to comply with the Act and any other\napplicable regulatory requirements. Our failure to comply with the Act and any other applicable regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to manufacture, distribute and deliver our Products and Services.\nSecurity and Privacy. U.S. federal, state and local laws and foreign legislation govern the confidentiality of personal information, how that information may be used, and the circumstances under which such information may be released. These regulations govern both the disclosure and use of confidential personal and patient medical record information and require the users of such information to implement specified security and privacy measures. U.S. regulations currently in place governing electronic health data transmissions continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply. Laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions are also evolving and may have similar or even stricter requirements related to the treatment of personal or patient information.\nData protection regulations impact how businesses, including both us and our clients, can collect and process the personal data of individuals. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws, regulations and policies, or modifications thereto, that are applicable to us may limit the use and adoption of our Products and Services and could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, we incur development, resource, and capital costs in delivering, updating, and supporting Products and Services to enable our U.S. and non-U.S. clients to comply with these varying and evolving standards. U.S. federal, state, and non-U.S. governmental enforcement personnel have substantial powers and remedies, particularly in the EU, to pursue suspected or perceived violations. If we fail to comply with any applicable laws or regulations or fail to deliver compliant Products and Services, we could be subject to civil penalties, sanctions and contract liability. Enforcement investigations, even if meritless, could have a negative impact on our reputation, cause us to lose existing clients or limit our ability to attract new clients. Furthermore, our failure to maintain confidentiality of sensitive personal information in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements could damage our reputation and expose us to claims, fines and penalties.\nIn the U.S., HIPAA regulations apply national standards for some types of electronic health information transactions and the data elements used in those transactions to ensure the integrity, security and confidentiality of health information and standards to protect the privacy of individually identifiable health information. Covered entities and their business associates under HIPAA, which include health care organizations such as our clients, our employer clinic business and our claims processing, transmission and submission services, are required to comply with HIPAA privacy standards, transaction regulations and security regulations. We and our U.S. clients are also subject to evolving state laws regarding the privacy and security of health care information and personal information generally.\nIn non-U.S. jurisdictions, we also are subject to transnational, national and local data protection legislation, including, but not limited to, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and Canadian Provincial legislation. In addition to EU and Canadian federal legislation, certain European member states and Canadian provinces have adopted more stringent data protection standards, particularly for health data. These regulations may impose restrictions on the processing of personal data (including health data) that, in some respects, are more stringent, and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses, than current privacy standards in the United States.\nIn non-U.S. jurisdictions, we are subject to potential restrictions on cross-border transfers of personal data to the United States as well as other countries where Cerner has business operations. A recent EU court decision regarding the adequacy of U.S. law to protect EU personal data created additional uncertainty regarding the lawfulness of transfers of EU personal data to the United States and India. Cerner has addressed these requirements through the execution of Standard Contractual Clause Agreements and by designing our support services to minimize, to the extent feasible, transfers of our EU client's patient data to the United States. However, the adoption of data privacy laws and court decisions that restrict cross border transfers or otherwise require data localization could have a material impact on our business. Furthermore, the perception by non-U.S. clients that we cannot provide adequate assurance for transfers of personal information may limit the use and adoption of our Products and Services and could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDevelopment and adoption of ML and AI technologies offer the potential to significantly improve the delivery of health care. The application of ML and AI technologies to personal and patient information may be regulated under some privacy laws (e.g. GDPR). Furthermore, the lack of standards for measuring the accuracy and effectiveness of ML and AI can raise new or exacerbate existing technological, legal or other challenges that could impact our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nInteroperability Standards. Our commercial and government clients continue to be subject to requirements to adopt interoperable HIT which requires that our Products and Services be interoperable with other third party HIT suppliers. Market forces and governmental/regulatory authorities create software interoperability standards that may apply to our Products and Services. In the case of certain of our Products, these interoperability standards are the basis of certification requirements that our Products must meet, and, in turn, many of our clients must meet prerequisite or participation requirements for many federal health insurance programs, including Medicare and Medicaid Fee for Service programs, for alternative payment models under the Innovation Center of CMS and for other federal or state health insurance or reimbursement programs. These expectations for interoperability are supported by the information blocking prohibitions of the Cures Act. If our Products and Services are not consistent with those requirements, we could be forced to incur substantial additional development costs to conform. The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) is also charged under the Cures Act with developing a Trusted Exchange Framework that establishes governance requirements for trusted health information exchange in the United States. ONC has developed the U.S. Common Data Set for Interoperability which may lay the groundwork for iterative expansion of future data exchange requirements for trusted exchange. ONC continues to modify and refine these standards. We may incur increased software development and administrative expense and delays in delivering Products and Services if we need to update our Products and Services to conform to these varying and evolving requirements. In addition, delays in interpreting these standards may result in postponement or cancellation of our clients' decisions to purchase our Products and Services. If our Products and Services are not compliant with these evolving standards, our market position and sales could be impaired, and we may have to invest significantly in changes to our Products and Services.\nFederal Requirements for Certified Health Information Technology. Various U.S. federal, state and non-government agencies continue to generate requirements for the use of certified health information technology. In many cases, these requirements have become conditions for receiving payment for health care services to beneficiaries of federal health insurance programs. These requirements are expansions of the statutory ARRA HITECH program that began providing incentive payments in 2011 to hospitals and eligible providers for the \"meaningful use of certified electronic health record technology (\"CEHRT\").\" Although those incentive programs have expired, CEHRT continues to be a requirement of participation in federal health care programs in order to receive reimbursement for health items and services provided by our clients to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. In 2015, MACRA required the use of CEHRT as part of its Quality Payment Program for eligible providers under Medicare. CEHRT is also one of the areas measured under the Merit based Incentive Payment System (known as MIPS) by which the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule was restructured. In the last several years, participation in Medicare's \"alternative payment models\" to replace traditional \"fee for service\" payments with quality and risk-sharing payment models has been conditioned on the adoption of CEHRT. The Cures Act has tied CEHRT to its policy goals of reducing barriers to the exchange of health information data blocking, encouraging nationwide interoperability, consumer access to health information and improving health information availability between consumers and their care teams. The regulations establishing the certification standards for CEHRT will continue to be updated to support these policy goals with greater emphasis on interoperability, consumer engagement, patient safety and health information privacy and security. The ONC has finalized additional regulations under the Cures Act to enforce the act's policy directives relating to data blocking and interoperability. Along with recent CMS actions taken for Medicare and Medicaid, these regulations will also mandate adoption of updated and expanded certified capabilities of CEHRT that our clients must adopt to remain able to participate in the federal programs mentioned earlier. In addition, the ONC has increased its surveillance activities concerning vendor compliance relative to CEHRT.\nWe have completed certification efforts to meet current CEHRT requirements that became mandatory for certain Federal programs. We will continue to address additional regulatory requirements to update our basis for CEHRT as they evolve to support the mandatory updates imposed by new regulations under the Cures Act. Given recent CMS regulations, these updates must become certified and adopted by our clients by January 1, 2023. However, these standards and specifications are subject to interpretation by the entities designated to certify our electronic health care technology as CEHRT compliant. Additionally, the Cures Act requires us to comply with conditions of certification such that if our business practices or our Products and Services are not compliant with these evolving regulatory requirements, our market position and sales could be impaired, and we may have to invest significantly in changes to our Products and Services. Further, we bear potential financial risks where we are alleged to have not appropriately complied with these regulations. We also bear financial risk where we have entered into agreements with clients to warrant their ability to meet future federal program requirements that require use of CEHRT. While a client's ability to meet future federal health program related attestation requirements may be dependent on the client's ability to adopt, rollout and attain sufficient use of our certified Products and Services on a timely basis, we may face risks that come from issues in full adoption of our certified Products and Services, which in turn could lead to a client missing its attestation targets. These risks are enhanced when we are under agreements to provide application management services to our clients that place\nresponsibilities on us for application configuration and implementation as a prerequisite to meaningful use attainment ordinarily borne by the client.\nOur work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment. Our clients include national, provincial, state, local and foreign governmental entities and their agencies. Our government work carries various risks inherent in contracting with government entities. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022Government entities, particularly in the United States, often reserve the right to audit our contracts and conduct reviews, inquiries and investigations of our business practices and performance with respect to government contracts. If a government client discovers improper conduct during its audits or investigations, we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties, including those under the civil U.S. False Claims Act, and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, suspension of payments, fines and civil money penalties, and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other government agencies.\n\u2022U.S. government contracting regulations impose strict compliance and disclosure obligations and our failure to comply with these obligations could be a basis for suspension or debarment, or both, from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract.\n\u2022Government contracts are subject to heightened reputational and contractual risks compared to contracts with commercial clients and often involve more extensive scrutiny and publicity. Negative publicity, including allegations of improper or illegal activity, poor contract performance, or information security breaches, regardless of accuracy, may adversely affect our reputation.\n\u2022Terms and conditions of government contracts also tend to be more onerous, are often more difficult to negotiate and involve additional costs. We must comply with specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements, as well as various statutes, regulations and requirements related to employment practices, recordkeeping and accounting. Our failure to comply with a variety of complex procurement rules and regulations could result in our liability for penalties, including termination of our government contracts, disqualification from bidding on future government contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting.\n\u2022Government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. Our VA Electronic Health Record Modernization and DOD MHS Genesis agreements are indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts. The change in presidential administration may affect VA and DOD budget priorities for this ongoing work.\n\u2022Government entities reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects at their convenience for lack of approved funding or other reasons, which could limit our recovery of reimbursable expenses or investments. In addition, government contracts may be protested, which could result in administrative procedures and litigation, result in delays in performance and payment, be expensive to defend and be incapable of prompt resolution.\n\u2022It is common in contracting with governments for there to be a prime contractor with privity of contract to the government client and one or more subcontractors. We serve in both capacities for different government clients. There are inherent risks in being a subcontractor, including without limitation, reliance on the performance of the prime contractor for the execution of the contract to the satisfaction of the client. Additionally, when we serve as the prime contractor, we rely on our subcontractors to fulfill certain contractual obligations under our agreements with government clients. A failure by the prime contractor to perform under an agreement under which we serve as a subcontractor, or a failure by a subcontractor to perform under an agreement under which we serve as a prime contractor, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved, but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCapital and Credit Risks\nVolatility and disruption resulting from global economic or market conditions could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our business, results of operations, financial condition and outlook may be impacted by the health of the global economy. Our business and financial performance, including new business bookings and collection of our accounts receivable, may be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions that cause a slowdown or decline in client spending. Reduced purchases by our clients or changes in payment terms could adversely affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our cash flow from operations. Bankruptcies or\nsimilar events affecting clients may cause us to incur bad debt expense at levels higher than historically experienced. Further, volatility and disruption in global financial markets may also limit our ability to access the capital markets at a time when we would like, or need, to raise capital, which could have an impact on our ability to react to changing economic and business conditions. Accordingly, if global financial and economic volatility continues or worsens, particularly in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nThere are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.34 billion of long-term debt outstanding, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. We have customary restrictive covenants in our current debt agreements, which may limit our flexibility to operate our business. These covenants include limitations on priority debt, liens, mergers, asset dispositions, and transactions with affiliates, and require us to maintain certain leverage and interest coverage ratios. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this section. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. In addition, the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") is scheduled to be phased out, and when it does, we will need to agree upon a replacement index with the lenders under our outstanding indebtedness at the time. Such new rates may not be as favorable to us as those in effect prior to any LIBOR phase-out. With respect to our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the \"Credit Agreement\") and the related interest rate swap, if the swap and the Credit Agreement replacement rates are not identical, our hedge could be less effective. Our failure to manage these risks effectively could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot guarantee that our capital allocation strategy, which may include share repurchases and dividend payments, will be fully implemented or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value. As of December 31, 2020, the total available for repurchase under our stock repurchase program was $927 million. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares. Additionally, while we expect to pay a cash dividend on a quarterly basis, future declarations of such quarterly cash dividends are subject to approval by the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors' determination that the declaration of dividends are in the best interests of Cerner and its shareholders. Either or both of our repurchase or dividend programs may be suspended or terminated at any time and, even if fully implemented, may not enhance long-term shareholder value.\nTax, Finance and Accounting Related Risks\nWe are subject to tax legislation in numerous countries; changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are a global corporation with a presence in more than 35 countries. As such, we are subject to tax laws, regulations and policies of the U.S. federal, state and local governments and comparable taxing authorities in other country jurisdictions. Changes in tax laws could cause us to experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rates in future periods and otherwise adversely affect our tax positions and our tax liabilities. Our effective tax rates, tax payments, tax credits or incentives could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws. In addition, U.S. federal, state and local, as well as other countries' tax laws and regulations, are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations and require significant judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. As these and other tax laws and related regulations change, our financial results could be materially impacted. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many intercompany transactions and calculations which could be subject to challenge by tax authorities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities and those authorities often do not agree with positions taken by us on our tax returns. Our intercompany transfer pricing has been reviewed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") and by foreign tax jurisdictions and will likely be subject to additional audits in the future. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge, which could result in additional taxation, penalties and interest payments.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets represent approximately 17% of our total assets and we could suffer losses due to asset impairment charges. We assess our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment periodically in accordance with applicable authoritative accounting guidance. Declines in business performance or other factors could result in a non-cash impairment charge. This could materially and negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur sales forecasts may vary from actual sales in a particular quarter. We use a \"pipeline\" system, a common industry practice, to forecast sales and trends in our business. Our sales associates monitor the status of all sales opportunities, such as the date when they estimate that a client will make a purchase decision and the potential dollar amount of the sale. These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline. We compare this pipeline at various points in time to evaluate trends in our business. This analysis provides guidance in business planning and forecasting, but these pipeline estimates are by their nature speculative. Our pipeline estimates are not necessarily reliable predictors of revenues in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time, partially because of changes in the pipeline and in conversion rates of the pipeline into contracts that can be very difficult to estimate. A negative variation in the expected conversion rate or timing of the pipeline into contracts, or in the pipeline itself, could cause our plan or forecast to be inaccurate and thereby adversely affect business results.\nLower than expected revenue growth or shifts in our revenue mix could adversely affect our results of operations. Our revenue growth and mix could vary over time due to a number of factors, including timing of contracts signing, changes in the health of our end markets, unexpected client attrition, and the mix of software, hardware, devices, maintenance, support and services revenues, which carry different margin rates which can vary from period to period. Our operating results could be harmed by changes in revenue mix and costs, together with numerous other factors, including rapid growth in lower margin services business, declines in software, and growth in non-cash expenses, such as amortization and depreciation.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur quarterly operating results may vary, which could adversely affect our stock price. Our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may continue to vary in future periods, including variations from guidance, expectations or historical results or trends. Quarterly operating results may vary for a number of reasons including demand for our Products and Services, the financial condition of our current and potential clients, our long sales cycle, potentially long installation and implementation cycles for larger, more complex systems, accounting policy changes, our clients' abilities to meet project milestones, seasonality of revenue collection and other factors described in this section and elsewhere in this report. As a result of health care industry trends and the market for our Products and Services, a large percentage of our revenues are generated by the sale and installation of larger, more complex and higher-priced systems. The sales process for these systems is lengthy and involves a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources by the client. Sales may be subject to delays due to changes in clients' internal budgets, procedures for approving large capital expenditures, competing needs for other capital expenditures, additions or amendments to applicable laws, availability of personnel resources or by actions taken by competitors. Revenue recognized in any quarter may also depend upon our clients' abilities to meet project milestones. Delays in the expected sale, installation or implementation of these large systems or in meeting project milestones may have a significant negative impact on our anticipated quarterly revenues and consequently our earnings, since a significant percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed. Because of the complexity and value of our contracts, the loss of even a small number of clients could have a significant negative effect on our financial results. We may also experience seasonality in revenues.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be volatile. The market for our common stock may experience significant price and volume fluctuations in response to a number of factors including actual or anticipated variations in operating results, articles or rumors about our performance or Products and Services, announcements of technological innovations or new services or products by our competitors or us, changes in expectations of future financial performance or estimates of securities analysts, governmental regulatory action, health care reform measures, client relationship developments, economic conditions and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Furthermore, broad market and industry fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance. As a matter of policy, we do not generally comment on our stock price or rumors.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially affect our financial results. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. In general, the functional currency of our subsidiaries is the local currency where the subsidiary operates. For each subsidiary, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the month of the transaction. Therefore, future fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies, could materially affect our financial results.\nOur Directors have authority to issue preferred stock and our corporate governance documents contain anti-takeover provisions. Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the preferences, rights and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders. The rights of the holders of common stock may be harmed by rights granted to the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future and issuances of preferred stock could be used to delay or hinder a change of control of the Company. In addition, some provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws could make it more difficult for a potential acquirer to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock or otherwise effect a change of control of the Company, such as advance notice of stockholder proposals at meetings, no ability to take action by written consent and restricting shareholders from calling special meetings. We are also subject to the business combination provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control.", "PERMNO": 10909, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "CERN"}
