{"cik": "845877", "company": "FEDERAL AGRICULTURAL MORTGAGE CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nFarmer Mac's business activities, financial performance, and results of operations are, by their nature, subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those related to access to the capital markets, the agricultural sector, the rural utilities industry, the regulatory environment, and the level of prevailing interest rates and overall market conditions. The following risk factors could materially affect Farmer Mac's financial condition and operating results and should be considered in conjunction with \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the risks and uncertainties described in the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" section. Furthermore, because new risk factors likely will emerge from time to time, management can neither predict all such risk factors nor assess the effects of such factors on Farmer Mac's business, operating results, and financial condition or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may affect Farmer Mac's actual results and financial condition. If any of the following risks\nmaterialize, Farmer Mac's business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Farmer Mac undertakes no obligation to update or revise this risk factor discussion, except as required by law.\nAn inability to access the equity and debt capital markets could have a material adverse effect on Farmer Mac's business, operating results, financial condition, and capital levels.\nFarmer Mac's ability to operate its business, meet its obligations, generate asset volume growth, and fulfill its statutory mission depends on Farmer Mac's capacity to remain adequately capitalized through the issuance of equity securities and to issue substantial amounts of debt frequently and at favorable rates. The issuance of equity and debt securities in the U.S. financial markets are primary sources of Farmer Mac's capitalization and funding for Farmer Mac's purchases of eligible loan assets and liquidity investment assets and for repaying or refinancing existing debt. Moreover, one of the primary sources of Farmer Mac's revenue is the net interest income earned from the difference, or \"spread,\" between the return received on assets held and the related borrowing costs. Farmer Mac's ability to obtain funds through the issuance of equity and debt securities, at favorable rates and terms, depends on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nFarmer Mac's corporate structure established by its charter, including its status as a government-sponsored enterprise, or GSE, and perceptions about the viability of stockholder-owned GSEs in general;\n\u2022\ncompliance with applicable statutory, regulatory, and board-approved capital requirements and any measures imposed by Farmer Mac's regulator or board of directors if Farmer Mac failed to comply with those requirements;\n\u2022\nFarmer Mac's financial results and changes in its financial condition;\n\u2022\npublic perception of the risks to and financial prospects of Farmer Mac's business;\n\u2022\nprevailing conditions in the capital markets;\n\u2022\nlack of a public debt rating may reduce demand for Farmer Mac's debt securities;\n\u2022\ncompetition from other issuers of GSE equity or debt; and\n\u2022\nlegislative or regulatory actions relating to Farmer Mac's business, including any actions that would affect Farmer Mac's GSE status.\nFactors affecting the agricultural sector or the rural utilities industry may negatively affect borrowers' profitability and, as a consequence, their ability to repay their loans on which Farmer Mac has assumed credit risk.\nExternal factors beyond Farmer Mac's control that could negatively affect borrowers' profitability could cause Farmer Mac to experience increased delinquency and default rates within its loan portfolio, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nsevere protracted or sudden adverse weather conditions, animal and plant disease outbreaks, restrictions on water supply, limited access to transportation to move agricultural products to markets, or other conditions affecting particular geographic regions or industries;\n\u2022\nvolatility in production expenses, including in commodity or fuel prices or labor costs or availability within any particular industry;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange markets or changes in the global economy that would reduce export demand for U.S. agricultural products;\n\u2022\nslow or negative economic growth, which could reduce demand for U.S. agricultural products;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in interest rates, agricultural land values, or other factors that may affect delinquency levels and credit losses on agricultural real estate mortgage loans;\n\u2022\nlegislative or regulatory developments or actions adversely affecting the agricultural sector or rural utilities industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in the general economy that could affect the availability of off-farm sources of income and prices of real estate for borrowers; and\n\u2022\neconomic conditions that may negatively affect the market for electricity in rural areas and consequently limit the ability of rural electric cooperatives to provide electricity or raise rates to achieve profitable levels.\nFarmer Mac's business, operating results, financial condition, and capital levels may be materially and adversely affected by external factors that may affect the price or marketability of Farmer Mac's products or Farmer Mac's ability to offer its products and services.\nFarmer Mac's business, operating results, financial condition, and capital levels may be materially and adversely affected by external factors, including adverse changes in the capital markets or changes in public policy, that may affect the price or marketability of Farmer Mac's products and services or Farmer Mac's ability to offer its products and services, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ndisruptions in the capital markets, which could adversely affect the value and performance of Farmer Mac's eligible loan assets and investment securities, liquidity position, and ability to access funding at favorable levels or to raise capital;\n\u2022\ncompetitive pressures in the purchase of loans eligible for Farmer Mac's lines of business and the sale of Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities and debt securities;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates that may increase the basis risk of Farmer Mac's hedging instruments, thereby increasing its funding costs; and\n\u2022\nlegislative or regulatory developments or interpretations of Farmer Mac's statutory charter that could adversely affect Farmer Mac or its ability to offer new products, the ability or motivation of certain lenders to participate in Farmer Mac's lines of business or the terms of any such participation, or increase the cost of related corporate activities.\nFarmer Mac's business development, profitability, and capital depend on the continued growth of the secondary market for agricultural real estate mortgage loans and for rural utilities loans, which may be constrained by a number of factors.\nContinued growth in Farmer Mac's business and future profitability may be constrained by conditions that limit the need or ability for lenders to obtain the benefits of the secondary market provided by Farmer Mac, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nreduced growth rates in the agricultural mortgage market caused by prevailing conditions in the overall economy;\n\u2022\nthe increase in capital levels or the availability of other sources of capital for customers of Farmer Mac;\n\u2022\nthe acceptance by Federal Home Loan Banks of agricultural real estate mortgage loans as collateral;\n\u2022\nthe historical preference of many agricultural lending institutions to retain loans in their portfolios rather than to sell them into the secondary market;\n\u2022\nthe small number of business partners that currently provide a significant portion of Farmer Mac's business volume, resulting in vulnerability as existing business volume pays down or matures and the status of these business partners evolves; and\n\u2022\nexpanded funding alternatives available to rural utilities.\nThe loss of business from key business partners or customers could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business and result in a decrease in its revenues and profits.\nFarmer Mac's business and ability to generate revenues and profits largely depends on its ability to purchase eligible loans or place eligible loans under guarantees or purchase commitments. Farmer Mac conducts a significant portion of its business with a small number of business partners. This results in vulnerability as existing assets pay down or mature and the status and needs of Farmer Mac's business partners evolve. In 2015, ten institutions generated approximately 55 percent of loan purchase volume in the Farm & Ranch line of business. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 95.7 percent of the $6.7 billion outstanding principal amount of AgVantage securities were issued by three institutions. Transactions with CFC have represented 100 percent of business volume under Farmer Mac's Rural Utilities line of business since its inception in 2008. Farmer Mac's ability to maintain the current relationships with its business partners or customers and the business generated by those business partners or customers is significant to Farmer Mac's business. Consequently, the loss of business from any one of Farmer Mac's key business partners could negatively impact Farmer Mac's revenues and profitability. Furthermore, Farmer Mac may not be able to replace the loss of business of a key business partner or customer with alternate sources of business due to limitations on the types of assets eligible for the secondary market provided by Farmer Mac under its charter, which could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business and result in a decrease in its revenues and profits.\nThe failure of an issuer to pay the outstanding principal amount or to issue new AgVantage securities upon the maturity of outstanding AgVantage securities could negatively affect Farmer Mac's liquidity position and income.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Farmer Mac had $6.7 billion of AgVantage securities outstanding, of which $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion will be maturing in 2016 and 2017, respectively. AgVantage securities are guaranteed by Farmer Mac as to the timely payment of interest and principal. The terms of most AgVantage securities do not require the periodic payment of principal based on amortization schedules and instead have fixed maturity dates when the secured general obligation is due. If the issuer of a maturing AgVantage security defaults and does not pay the outstanding principal amount due upon maturity, Farmer Mac's liquidity position could be negatively affected because Farmer Mac will be required to obtain funds in a significant amount to pay the holder of the AgVantage security or, for AgVantage securities owned by Farmer Mac, to pay off the debt securities used to fund the purchase of the AgVantage securities. Farmer Mac's income could also be adversely affected if the issuer of a maturing AgVantage security does not issue new AgVantage securities to replace the maturing securities and Farmer Mac does not find alternate sources of business, or if the net interest margin earned by Farmer Mac on new AgVantage securities that replace maturing AgVantage securities is lower than the margin earned on the maturing AgVantage securities.\nFarmer Mac is a GSE that may be materially and adversely affected by legislative or political developments, which may affect the ongoing operations or continued existence of GSEs.\nFarmer Mac is a GSE that is governed by a statutory charter, which is subject to amendment by the U.S. Congress at any time, and regulated by government agencies. Although Farmer Mac is not aware of any pending legislative proposals that would adversely affect either the manner in which Farmer Mac conducts its business or the status of Farmer Mac as a GSE at this time, Farmer Mac's ability to effectively conduct its business is subject to risks and uncertainties related to legislative or political developments that may affect the status or operations of GSEs generally. From time to time, legislative initiatives may be commenced that, if successful, could result in the enactment of legislation or the promulgation of regulations that could negatively affect the status of Farmer Mac as a GSE or the manner in which Farmer Mac operates. Farmer Mac cannot predict whether any legislative proposals related to the housing GSEs would also address the continued GSE status of Farmer Mac or modify the current operating structure or authorities of Farmer Mac in any material way. Implementation of any such proposal could have a material and adverse effect on Farmer Mac's business, operating results, financial condition, and capital levels. See \"Government Regulation of Farmer Mac\" in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion on the rules and regulations governing Farmer Mac's activities.\nFarmer Mac is subject to capital requirements that are subject to change, and failure to meet those requirements could result in supervisory measures or the inability of Farmer Mac to declare dividends, or otherwise materially and adversely affect Farmer Mac's business, operating results, or financial condition.\nFarmer Mac is required by statute and regulation to maintain certain capital levels. Any inability by Farmer Mac to meet these capital requirements could result in supervisory measures by FCA, adversely affect Farmer Mac's ability to declare dividends on its common and preferred stock, or otherwise materially and adversely affect Farmer Mac's business, operating results, or financial condition. In addition, as required by an FCA regulation on capital planning, Farmer Mac has adopted a policy to maintain a sufficient level of Tier 1 capital and to impose restrictions on paying Tier 1-eligible dividends in the event that Tier 1 capital falls below specified thresholds. For more information on Farmer Mac's capital requirements, including the Tier 1 capital requirement, see \"Business-Government Regulation of Farmer Mac-Regulation-Capital Standards.\" Factors that could adversely affect the adequacy of Farmer Mac's capital levels in the future, and which may be beyond Farmer Mac's control, include:\n\u2022\nthe potential for any other-than-temporary impairment charges;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in interest rates or credit spreads;\n\u2022\nthe potential need to increase the level of the allowance for losses on eligible loan assets in the future;\n\u2022\nlegislative or regulatory actions that increase Farmer Mac's applicable capital requirements; and\n\u2022\nchanges in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\").\nFarmer Mac is exposed to credit risk on its eligible loan assets, the repayment of which may depend on factors outside of Farmer Mac's or the borrower's control, and widespread repayment shortfalls on loans could have a material adverse effect on Farmer Mac's financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nFarmer Mac's earnings depend significantly on the performance of its eligible loan assets and the spread between the interest, guarantee fees, and commitment fees earned on such assets and interest paid on\nFarmer Mac's obligations and liabilities. Farmer Mac assumes the ultimate credit risk of borrower defaults on the agricultural mortgage and rural utilities loans it holds, as well as the loans underlying LTSPCs and non-AgVantage Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities. Widespread repayment shortfalls on loans in the Farm & Ranch line of business or Rural Utilities line of business could result in losses on loans held or require Farmer Mac to pay under its guarantees and LTSPCs, which could have a material adverse effect on Farmer Mac's financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nIn the Farm & Ranch line of business, repayment of eligible loans typically depends on the success of the related farming operation, which, in turn, depends on many variables and factors over which farmers may have little or no control, such as weather conditions, animal and plant disease outbreaks, restrictions on water supply, economic conditions (both domestic and international), demand for U.S. agricultural products, and political conditions. Farmer Mac's credit risk may also increase in the case of a loan with a balloon payment due at maturity if the borrower seeks to refinance but is unable to do so. As of December 31, 2015, 65.8 percent of the loans in the Farm & Ranch line of business included balloon payments. In addition, loans to borrowers in industries that have had historically higher delinquency rates relative to Farmer Mac's overall portfolio may present a higher risk of delinquency in future periods. For example, as of December 31, 2015, loans to borrowers in the permanent plantings and part-time farm categories comprised a combined 20.1 percent of the Farm & Ranch portfolio, but delinquencies in these combined categories comprised 31.3 percent of the aggregate delinquencies for all commodity categories. As of December 31, 2015, loans to borrowers in the Agricultural Storage and Processing category (including ethanol facilities) comprised 1.4 percent of the Farm & Ranch portfolio, but cumulative net credit losses for this category comprised 45.5 percent of the cumulative net credit losses for all categories.\nIn the Rural Utilities line of business, eligible utilities operations include the distribution of electricity, the generation and transmission of electricity, and telecommunications. Each type of utility operation has different inherent risks associated with it, but all share a common risk posed by potential changes in public and regulatory policies. Business cash flows can be disrupted as a result of storms, though distribution cooperatives have in place cost-sharing arrangements with providers in other regions that mitigate this exposure. Historically, natural disasters have often resulted in disaster area declarations and financial aid to utilities providers through the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other conduits, although there can be no assurance that any such aid would be available in the event of any future natural disaster. The electrical distribution and generation sectors can be adversely affected by changes in fuel costs and prices received from consumers, as well as by contractual power obligations that do not match up with supply or demand. In the event that Farmer Mac purchases telecommunications loans in the future, the depth and pace of technological change in the telecommunications industry can also provide significant challenges, as the industry requires heavy capital investment and correct judgments about the sustainability of new technologies in an area with many competitors.\nFarmer Mac Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs expose Farmer Mac to significant contingent liabilities, and Farmer Mac's ability to fulfill its obligations under its guarantees and LTSPCs may be limited.\nFarmer Mac's guarantee and purchase commitment obligations to third parties, including Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs, are obligations of Farmer Mac only and are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, FCA, or any other agency or instrumentality of the United States other than Farmer Mac. As of December 31, 2015, Farmer Mac had $4.6 billion of contingent liabilities related to Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs issued to third parties, which represents Farmer Mac's exposure if all loans underlying these guarantees and LTSPCs defaulted and Farmer Mac recovered\nno value from the related collateral. Farmer Mac's principal sources of funds for payments on all of its liabilities, including claims that may arise under its guarantees and LTSPCs, are the liquid assets held by Farmer Mac (including cash and cash equivalents), guarantee and commitment fees, interest payments on assets held by Farmer Mac, loan repayments, repayment of principal amounts due upon maturity of AgVantage securities, and proceeds from the issuance of debt securities. If all of the loans underlying Farmer Mac's guarantees and LTSPCs defaulted and Farmer Mac recovered no value from the related collateral, the funds for payment on these guarantees and LTSPCs could be substantially less than the aggregate amount of the corresponding liabilities. It is difficult to quantify at any particular point in time the funds that would be available from interest payments, loan repayments, and maturing AgVantage securities for payment on Farmer Mac's guarantees and LTSPCs, and Farmer Mac's ability to issue debt as a source of repayment would be subject to its ability to access the debt markets and market conditions at that time. As of December 31, 2015, Farmer Mac held cash, cash equivalents, and other investment securities with a fair value of $4.0 billion that could be used as a source of funds for payment on its obligations. Although Farmer Mac believes that it remains well-collateralized on the assets underlying its guarantee and purchase commitment obligations to third parties and that the estimated probable losses for these obligations remain low relative to the amount available for payment of claims on these obligations, Farmer Mac's total contingent liabilities for these obligations exceed the amount it may have available for payment of claims on these obligations. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis-Risk Management-Credit Risk - Loans and Guarantees\" for more information on Farmer Mac's management of credit risk.\nFarmer Mac is exposed to swap counterparty credit risk on its non-cleared swaps that could materially and adversely affect its business, operating results, and financial condition.\nFarmer Mac relies on interest rate swap contracts and hedging arrangements to effectively manage its interest rate risk. A significant portion of Farmer Mac's interest rate swap contracts are not cleared through swap clearinghouses, which creates swap counterparty credit risk on those non-cleared swaps. In managing this risk, Farmer Mac contracts only with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings, establishes and maintains collateral requirements that are scaled based upon credit ratings, and enters into netting agreements. Additionally, new rules that become effective later this year will establish minimum requirements for the exchange of initial and variation margin between Farmer Mac and its swap dealer counterparties in non-cleared swaps transactions. However, failure to perform under a non-cleared derivatives contract by one or more of Farmer Mac's counterparties could disrupt Farmer Mac's hedging operations, particularly if Farmer Mac were entitled to a termination payment under the terms of the contract that it did not receive, or if Farmer Mac were unable to reposition the swap with a new counterparty. Of the $8.4 billion combined notional amount of interest rate swaps, $2.2 billion were not cleared through swap clearinghouses as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, Farmer Mac's credit exposure to interest rate swap counterparties was $6.4 million excluding netting arrangements and $47,000 including netting arrangements.\nFarmer Mac is exposed to counterparty credit risk on AgVantage securities that could materially and adversely affect its business, operating results, and financial condition.\nFarmer Mac is exposed to credit risk from issuers of AgVantage securities. Each AgVantage security is a general obligation of an issuing institution secured by eligible loans in an amount at least equal to the outstanding principal amount of the security and guaranteed by Farmer Mac. However, most of Farmer Mac's AgVantage exposure is concentrated in a small number of issuers. Farmer Mac seeks to manage its risk to AgVantage counterparties by reviewing each institution for which Farmer Mac has AgVantage exposure and requiring those institutions to meet Farmer Mac's standards for creditworthiness. In\naddition, Farmer Mac requires some level of overcollateralization (currently between 102 percent and 125 percent of the principal amount of the securities issued) and in some cases, compliance by the counterparty with specified financial covenants for the life of the related AgVantage securities, for AgVantage securities secured by Farm & Ranch loans. As of December 31, 2015, nearly all of the AgVantage securities outstanding had been issued by three counterparties. A default by any of these counterparties could have a significant adverse effect on Farmer Mac's business, operating results, and financial condition.\nFarmer Mac is exposed to counterparty credit risk on its investment securities that could materially and adversely affect its business, operating results, and financial condition.\nFarmer Mac maintains an investment portfolio that can be drawn upon for liquidity needs. In addition to cash and cash equivalents (such as U.S. Treasury securities and short-term money market instruments), this portfolio consists of investment securities, including securities guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies and GSEs, GSE-issued preferred stock, corporate debt obligations, and auction-rate certificates. Though some of these investment securities do not qualify for purposes of calculating liquidity under the regulatory requirements prescribed by FCA, they still may be drawn upon for Farmer Mac's liquidity needs. Farmer Mac regularly reviews concentration limits to ensure that its investments are appropriately diversified and comply with policies approved by Farmer Mac's board of directors and with applicable FCA regulations, but Farmer Mac is still exposed to credit risk from issuers of the investment securities it holds. For example, as of December 31, 2015, Farmer Mac held at fair value, as part of its liquidity investment portfolio, $20.0 million of corporate debt securities, $83.4 million of asset-backed securities principally backed by U.S. Government-guaranteed student loans (including $44.9 million of auction-rate certificates), and $1.1 billion of investment securities guaranteed by GSEs. A default by multiple issuers of investment securities held by Farmer Mac, or by a single issuer of investment securities in which Farmer Mac is more heavily concentrated, could have an adverse effect on Farmer Mac's business, operating results, and financial condition.\nFarmer Mac is exposed to interest rate risk that could materially and adversely affect its business, operating results, and financial condition.\nFarmer Mac is subject to interest rate risk due to the possible timing differences in the cash flows of the assets it holds and related liabilities. Farmer Mac's primary strategy for managing interest rate risk is to fund asset purchases with liabilities that have similar duration and cash flow characteristics so that they will perform similarly as interest rates change. Through Farmer Mac's issuances of debt securities in the form of discount notes and medium-term notes coupled with interest rate swap contracts that adjust the characteristics of the debt issued, Farmer Mac seeks to match its liabilities closely with the cash flow and duration characteristics of its loans and other assets. However, the ability of borrowers to prepay their loans prior to the scheduled maturities increases the risk of asset and liability cash flow mismatches. In a changing interest rate environment, these cash flow mismatches could reduce Farmer Mac's earnings if assets repay sooner than expected and the resulting cash flows must be reinvested in lower-yielding investments, particularly if Farmer Mac's related funding costs cannot be correspondingly repaid. In addition, if assets repay more slowly than anticipated and the associated debt issued to fund the assets must be reissued at a higher yield, Farmer Mac's earnings could be adversely affected. As of December 31, 2015, of all the outstanding business volume held on Farmer Mac's balance sheet, $4.9 billion had a fixed interest rate and $6.4 billion had an indexed or non-indexed adjustable interest rate.\nFarmer Mac is also subject to another type of interest rate risk due to changes in its cost of funds relative to floating rate market indexes (such as LIBOR) on some of the floating rate assets it holds, which is referred to as \"basis risk.\" Some of Farmer Mac's floating rate assets reset on rate adjustment dates on the basis of a floating rate market index, whereas the related debt that Farmer Mac issued to fund those assets until their maturities may be refinanced on the basis of Farmer Mac's cost of funds at a particular time. Basis risk arises from the potential variability between the rates at which those floating rate assets reset and the rates at which Farmer Mac can issue or refinance debt to fund those assets until their maturities. Farmer Mac is also subject to basis risk on some of its fixed rate assets as a result of its use of pay-fixed interest rate swaps, combined with a series of discount note or medium-term note issuances, as an alternative source of effectively fixed rate funding. This risk arises because the rates at which Farmer Mac refinances its funding for some fixed rate assets through the issuance of discount notes or medium-term notes may vary from the agreed-upon rates based on the floating rate market index received by Farmer Mac on the associated swaps. If the rates on Farmer Mac\u2019s discount notes or medium-term notes deteriorate relative to LIBOR during the time between when its indexed floating rate assets were first funded and when Farmer Mac refinances the associated debt or in cases when Farmer Mac uses pay-fixed swaps to fund its fixed rate assets, Farmer Mac is exposed to a commensurate reduction in its net effective spread. Conversely, if the rates on Farmer Mac\u2019s discount notes or medium-term notes improve relative to LIBOR during that time or in cases when Farmer Mac uses pay-fixed swaps to fund its fixed rate assets, Farmer Mac would benefit from a commensurate increase in its net effective spread. Although Farmer Mac seeks to issue debt of sufficient maturity to reduce the frequency of required refinancing of that debt over the life of the associated asset, it may not be able to successfully do so, which could adversely impact its business, operating results, and financial condition. As of December 31, 2015, Farmer Mac held $5.8 billion of floating-rate assets in its lines of business and its liquidity investment portfolio that reset on the basis of floating rate market indexes, primarily one-month and three-month LIBOR. As of the same date, Farmer Mac also had $1.8 billion of interest rate swaps outstanding where Farmer Mac pays a fixed rate of interest and receives a floating rate of interest.\nChanges in interest rates relative to Farmer Mac's management of interest rate risk through derivatives may cause volatility in financial results and capital levels and may adversely affect net income.\nFarmer Mac enters into financial derivatives transactions to hedge interest rate risks inherent in its business and measures its financial derivatives at fair value. Although Farmer Mac's financial derivatives provide effective economic hedges of interest rate risk, changes in the fair values of financial derivatives can cause volatility in net income and in capital, particularly if those financial derivatives are not designated in hedge accounting relationships or if there is any ineffectiveness in a hedge accounting relationship. As interest rates increase or decrease, the fair values of Farmer Mac's derivatives change based on the position Farmer Mac holds relative to the specific characteristics of the derivative. Farmer Mac's core capital that is available to meet its statutory minimum capital requirement can be affected by changes in the fair values of financial derivatives, as noted above. Adverse changes in the fair values of Farmer Mac's financial derivatives that are not designated in hedge accounting relationships and any hedge ineffectiveness that results in a loss would reduce the amount of core capital available to meet this requirement, which could result in regulatory enforcement action against Farmer Mac if it were unable to meet the requirement. In 2015 and 2014, Farmer Mac recorded unrealized gains of $1.9 million and unrealized losses of $21.8 million, respectively, from changes in the fair values of its financial derivatives as a result of movements in interest rates during those years.\nChanges in interest rates as well as certain credit events may trigger collateralization requirements for Farmer Mac under its derivatives contracts, which could adversely affect Farmer Mac's liquidity position and operating results.\nFarmer Mac uses derivatives contracts to help manage its interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates have required, and in the future may require, Farmer Mac to post cash or investment securities to its derivative counterparties to reflect the changes in fair market values of Farmer Mac's derivatives as a result of the changes in interest rates. For example, as of December 31, 2015, Farmer Mac posted $38.0 million of cash as collateral for its derivatives in net liability positions. If changes in interest rates were to result in a significant decrease in the fair value of Farmer Mac's derivatives, Farmer Mac would be required to post a significant amount of cash, cash equivalents, or investment securities, possibly within a short period of time, to satisfy its obligations under its derivatives contracts. Farmer Mac's derivatives contracts currently contain provisions establishing minimum threshold collateral amounts, ranging between $15 million and $25 million, below which Farmer Mac is not required to post collateral, though these amounts may be reduced to zero upon the occurrence of specified credit events such as insolvency, receivership, failure to make a payment under the contract when due, or failure to continue as an instrumentality of the United States. The amount required to be posted would increase if Farmer Mac also experienced a credit event triggering full collateralization of its derivatives positions without any minimum threshold. Additionally, new rules that become effective later this year will establish minimum requirements for the exchange of initial and variation margin between Farmer Mac and its swap dealer counterparties in non-cleared swaps transactions. These rules or the evolving norms of the derivatives industry as a result of these rules may cause some or all of Farmer Mac's swap counterparties to seek to amend the provisions in their derivatives contracts with Farmer Mac related to the minimum threshold collateral amounts below which Farmer Mac would not be required to post collateral for currently existing swaps and/or swaps entered into in the future, which could significantly increase the amount of collateral Farmer Mac is required to post or could require a full collateralization of Farmer Mac's derivatives positions. As of December 31, 2015, the amount that would have been required for full collateralization of Farmer Mac's derivatives positions given the fair value of Farmer Mac's derivatives at that time was $45.2 million. If Farmer Mac were required to significantly increase the amount of collateral it is required to post or fully collateralize its derivatives position in an adverse interest rate environment, it could have a negative effect on Farmer Mac's liquidity position and operating results.\nIncorrect estimates and assumptions by management in preparing financial statements could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business, operating results, reported assets and liabilities, financial condition, and capital levels.\nIncorrect estimates and assumptions by management in connection with the preparation of Farmer Mac's consolidated financial statements could adversely affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses. The preparation of Farmer Mac's consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods. For example, as of December 31, 2015, Farmer Mac's assets and liabilities recorded at fair value included financial instruments valued at $6.1 billion whose fair values were estimated by management in the absence of readily determinable fair values (in other words, level 3). These financial instruments measured as level 3 represented 39 percent of total assets and 69 percent of financial instruments measured at fair value as of December 31, 2015. Further information regarding fair value measurement is included in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis-Critical Accounting Policies-Fair Value Measurement.\" If management makes incorrect assumptions or estimates, Farmer Mac may\nunderstate or overstate reported financial results, which could materially and adversely affect Farmer Mac's business, operating results, reported assets and liabilities, financial condition, and capital levels.\nChanges in the value or composition of Farmer Mac's investment securities could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business, operating results, financial condition, and capital levels.\nDeterioration in financial or credit market conditions could reduce the fair value of Farmer Mac's investment securities, particularly those securities that are less liquid and more subject to market variability. Some securities owned by Farmer Mac, including auction-rate certificates and GSE subordinated debt, do not have well-established secondary trading markets, making it more difficult to estimate current fair values for those securities. Adverse financial market conditions may further compound the challenges of estimating fair values for Farmer Mac's securities, as was the case in 2008 after widespread failure of the auction mechanism that had been established to provide liquidity for the auction-rate certificates that Farmer Mac currently holds.\nFarmer Mac relies on market observations to determine the fair value of its investment securities, although the market data Farmer Mac relies upon may not reflect the actual sale conditions that Farmer Mac would face when selling its investment securities. For example, the market value of auction-rate certificates held by Farmer Mac depends in large part on the amounts and timing of the expected cash flows on these securities, which may be highly uncertain. Therefore, a change in the amounts or timing of cash flows could materially alter the market price of those securities. Subsequent valuations of these and other investment securities, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the value of Farmer Mac's investment securities. For example, the current market values for the auction-rate certificates and GSE subordinated debt held by Farmer Mac are significantly below their amortized cost due to widening credit spreads after purchase. As of December 31, 2015, the fair values of Farmer Mac's auction-rate certificates and GSE subordinated debt were $44.9 million and $66.2 million, respectively, compared to Farmer Mac's amortized cost of $46.5 million and $70.0 million, respectively, for each of these classes of investment securities.\nFarmer Mac also relies on internal models to estimate the fair values of its investment securities and to determine whether credit losses exist, which requires Farmer Mac to exercise judgment about estimates and assumptions used in the models. If Farmer Mac uses incorrect estimates or assumptions in the internal models it develops to estimate the fair value of its investment securities, those models could adversely affect reported income during the reporting period.\nIf Farmer Mac decides to sell securities in its investment portfolio, the price ultimately realized will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at the time of sale. Farmer Mac's inability to sell the securities in its investment portfolio at or above their estimated fair values could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business, operating results, financial condition, and capital levels.\nFarmer Mac's ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of its business, and failure to do so may materially adversely affect Farmer Mac's performance or financial condition.\nFarmer Mac relies on its employees' breadth and depth of knowledge of agricultural and rural utilities lending, financial products, and other areas of expertise to run its business operations successfully. A significant disruption in the continuity of Farmer Mac's employees would require Farmer Mac to expend resources to replace personnel and could result in a loss of productivity in the interim. If Farmer Mac is\nunable to continue to retain and attract qualified employees, Farmer Mac's performance or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nAny failure, interruption, or breach in Farmer Mac's information systems, including the occurrence of successful cyber incidents or a significant deficiency in Farmer Mac's cyber security, could result in a loss of business, damage to Farmer Mac's reputation, the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, or increased costs or liability to Farmer Mac, which could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business, operating results, or financial condition.\nFarmer Mac relies heavily on information systems, including from third parties, to conduct and manage its business operations. These information systems encompass an integrated set of hardware, software, infrastructure, and trained personnel organized to facilitate the planning, control, coordination, and decision-making processes occurring within Farmer Mac. As Farmer Mac's reliance on information systems has increased, so have the risks posed to its systems, including the effect of events that would threaten the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of Farmer Mac's information resources, known as cyber incidents. Farmer Mac has undertaken preventive measures and devotes significant resources to regularly audit, upgrade, and maintain its information systems and cyber security program according to industry best practices. Specifically, Farmer Mac's cyber security program routinely assesses Farmer Mac's cyber security risk profile and seeks to ensure there are sufficient measures and safeguards in place to mitigate the risks identified. However, Farmer Mac may not be able to prevent, address on a timely and adequate basis, or fully mitigate the negative effects associated with a successful cyber attack on Farmer Mac's or its third party information systems, which could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business, operating results, or financial condition. A failure or interruption in any of Farmer Mac's information systems could result in a disruption or malfunction of its operations, which could adversely affect Farmer Mac's ability to conduct business with its lenders, loan servicers, service providers, or other counterparties, result in financial loss, or cause damage to Farmer Mac's reputation.\nThe secure transmission, processing, and storage of Farmer Mac's confidential, proprietary, and other information assets through Farmer Mac's or its third party information systems is instrumental to Farmer Mac's operations. Any action that results in unauthorized access to Farmer Mac's information systems by third parties, including through viruses, malware, cyber attacks, or other information system breaches, could disrupt Farmer Mac's operations, corrupt its data, or result in the misappropriation, unauthorized release, loss, or destruction of the confidential, proprietary, or other information assets of its lenders, loan servicers, service providers, or other counterparties. Similar to many other financial institutions, Farmer Mac faces regular attempts by third parties to gain unauthorized access to its information systems. To Farmer Mac's knowledge, no cyber incident has resulted in unauthorized access to Farmer Mac's or its customers' confidential, proprietary, or other information . However, any future instance in which unauthorized access to Farmer Mac's information systems or sensitive information is obtained could cause Farmer Mac to experience prolonged operational interruption, damage to its reputation, material loss of business, legal liability, or increased costs from private data exposure, which could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business, operating results, or financial condition.\nFarmer Mac depends on third-party vendors, including loan servicers, information systems providers, and other service providers, to protect confidential information from unauthorized access and dissemination, and these vendors' failure to do so could result in liability for Farmer Mac or damage Farmer Mac's reputation, which could have a negative effect on Farmer Mac's business, operating results, or financial condition.\nFarmer Mac relies on third-party vendors, including loan servicers, information systems providers, and other service providers, to perform various functions for Farmer Mac. In the course of these activities, these vendors collect and have access to a variety of confidential or proprietary information, including, among others, sensitive financial information, information presented to Farmer Mac's board of directors, information provided to Farmer Mac's regulators, information about the lenders that participate in Farmer Mac's lines of business, and personal financial information about the borrowers with loans included in one of Farmer Mac's lines of business. Any unauthorized access to a vendor's information systems by third parties, including through viruses, malware, cyber attacks, or other information system breaches, could result in the misappropriation and unauthorized release of the confidential or proprietary information entrusted to Farmer Mac. Also, any vendor's employees or agents that have access to confidential or proprietary information could inadvertently disseminate the information to unauthorized third parties. Any unauthorized access to or dissemination of confidential or proprietary information could result in liability for Farmer Mac or damage Farmer Mac's reputation, either of which could have a negative effect on Farmer Mac's business, operating results, or financial condition.\nIf Farmer Mac's management of risk associated with its eligible loan assets and investment securities is not effective, its business, operating results, financial condition, and capital levels could be materially adversely affected.\nEvents in the financial markets since 2008 leading to heightened volatility and tightened liquidity and credit have challenged financial institutions, including Farmer Mac, to adapt and further develop profitability and risk management models adequate to address a wider range of possible market developments. Farmer Mac's techniques and strategies may not be effective in mitigating its risk exposure in all economic market environments or against all types of risk, including risks that Farmer Mac fails to identify or anticipate. Some of Farmer Mac's qualitative tools and metrics for managing risk are based upon its use of observed historical market behavior. Farmer Mac applies statistical and other tools to these observations to quantify its risks. These tools and metrics may fail to predict future or unanticipated risk. Such failures could, for example, arise from factors Farmer Mac did not anticipate or correctly evaluate in its models. In addition, Farmer Mac's quantified modeling does not take into account all risks. Farmer Mac's more qualitative approach to managing those risks could prove insufficient, exposing it to material unanticipated losses. The inability of Farmer Mac to effectively identify and manage the risks inherent in its business could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results, financial condition, and capital levels.\nThe trading price for Farmer Mac's Class C non-voting common stock may be volatile due to market influences, trading volume, or the effects of equity awards for Farmer Mac's officers, directors, and employees.\nThe trading price of Farmer Mac's Class C non-voting common stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility and may continue to be volatile. For example, from January 2015 to December 2015, the closing price of the stock ranged from $22.41 per share to $33.01 per share. The trading price may fluctuate in response to various factors, including short sales, hedging, the presence or absence of a share\nrepurchase program, or stock market influences in general that are unrelated to Farmer Mac's operating performance. In September 2015, Farmer Mac implemented a share repurchase program under which it is authorized to repurchase up to $25 million of its Class C non-voting common stock until September 2017. As of December 31, 2015, approximately $14.5 million of this authorization remained. In addition, as a component of compensation for officers, directors, and employees, Farmer Mac typically grants equity awards each year that are based on the Class C non-voting common stock, including stock appreciation rights and restricted stock that vest over time or upon the achievement of specified performance goals. Sales of stock acquired upon vesting or the exercise of equity awards by Farmer Mac's officers, directors, or employees, whether pursuant to an established trading plan or otherwise, could adversely affect the trading price of Farmer Mac's Class C non-voting common stock. These factors may be exacerbated during periods of low trading volume for Farmer Mac's Class C non-voting common stock, which averaged approximately 39,000 shares daily during 2015, and may have a prolonged negative effect on its trading price or increase price volatility.\nFarmer Mac's efforts to pursue its Congressional mission of providing a secondary market for loans made to borrowers in rural America may adversely affect its business, operating results, and financial condition.\nCongress created Farmer Mac to provide for a secondary market for agricultural mortgage loans, loans to rural utilities cooperatives, and the guaranteed portions of USDA-guaranteed loans. In pursuing this mission, Farmer Mac's secondary market activities are designed to:\n\u2022\nincrease the availability of long-term credit to rural borrowers at stable interest rates;\n\u2022\nprovide greater liquidity and lending capacity in extending credit to rural borrowers; and\n\u2022\nprovide an arrangement for new lending by facilitating capital market investments in long-term funding for rural borrowers, including funds at fixed rates of interest.\nAlthough Farmer Mac strives to undertake its mission-related activities in a manner consistent with providing a positive return to Farmer Mac's stockholders, it is possible that these activities may contribute to a lower return to stockholders than if Farmer Mac's sole purpose were to maximize stockholder value. In addition, it is possible that the entities that regulate Farmer Mac could seek to alter Farmer Mac's mission-related activities in the future or place limits on its liquidity investments that provide liquidity for Farmer Mac's mission-related activities. If this were to happen, and Farmer Mac were required to undertake activities involving greater risk to satisfy its Congressional mission, Farmer Mac's business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nA few stockholders who own large amounts of Farmer Mac voting common stock may seek to influence Farmer Mac's business, strategy, or board composition, and the interests of these stockholders may differ from the interests of Farmer Mac or other holders of Farmer Mac's common stock.\nThe ownership of Farmer Mac's two classes of voting common stock is currently concentrated in a small number of institutions. Approximately 44 percent of Farmer Mac's Class A voting common stock is held by three financial institutions, with 31 percent held by one institution. Approximately 97 percent of Farmer Mac's Class B voting common stock is held by five FCS institutions (two of which are related to each other through a parent-subsidiary relationship). Three of those five FCS institutions may be deemed to have entered into a voting arrangement regarding the election of directors to Farmer Mac's board of directors.\nMany holders of Farmer Mac's voting common stock are rural lenders that may compete directly with each other. At times, some of these voting stockholders may also view Farmer Mac as an indirect competitor because Farmer Mac's secondary market activities often provide attractive funding and effective risk management tools that help many lenders compete in the origination of eligible rural loans. As long as Farmer Mac's Class A and Class B voting common stock is highly concentrated in a small number of institutions, there is the potential that these institutions will seek to influence Farmer Mac's business, strategy, or board composition in a way that may not be in the best interests of either Farmer Mac or all other stockholders. Furthermore, the interests of the holders of Farmer Mac's Class A and Class B voting common stock may not be fully aligned with each other or the interests of Farmer Mac's Class C non-voting common stockholders, and this could lead to a strategy that is not in the best interests of Farmer Mac or all of its stockholders. The holders of Farmer Mac's Class A voting common stock and the holders of Farmer Mac's Class B voting common stock each have the right to elect one third of the membership of Farmer Mac's Board. Accordingly, each of these stockholder classes has the potential to significantly influence Farmer Mac's business and strategy in a manner that may not be in the best interests of all stockholders.\nAny of the risks described in this section could materially and adversely affect Farmer Mac's business, operating results, financial condition, capital levels, and future earnings.
