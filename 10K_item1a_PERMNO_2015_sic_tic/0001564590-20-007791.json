{"cik": "1348036", "company": "AVALARA, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making an investment decision. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occurs, our business, operating results, financial condition, cash flows, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nWe have incurred significant operating losses in the past and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since our inception, including net losses of $50.2 million, $75.6 million, and $64.1 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. We had an accumulated deficit of $510.2 million as of December 31, 2019. Because the market for our solutions is not fully developed and is rapidly evolving, it is difficult for us to predict our results of operations. We expect our operating expenses to continue to increase in future periods as we hire additional sales and other personnel, improve the Avalara Compliance Cloud, invest in sales and marketing initiatives, expand our international reach, and potentially acquire complementary technology and businesses. If our revenue does not increase to offset increases in our operating expenses, we may never achieve or maintain profitability. Revenue growth may slow, revenue may decline, or we may incur significant losses in the future for a number of possible reasons, including slowing demand for our solutions, general macroeconomic conditions, increasing competition, a decrease or slowing in the growth of the markets in which we compete, or if we fail for any reason to capitalize on growth opportunities. Additionally, we may encounter unforeseen operating expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, service delivery and quality problems, regulatory or legislative changes, and other unknown factors that may result in losses in future periods. If these losses exceed our expectations or if our revenue growth expectations are not met in future periods, our financial performance will be harmed.\nOur revenue growth rate depends on existing customers renewing and upgrading their subscriptions, and if we fail to retain our customers or upgrade their subscriptions, our business will be harmed.\nWe cannot accurately predict customer behavior. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our solutions after the expiration of their subscription periods and our customers may not renew subscriptions for a similar mix of solutions or transaction volumes. Our renewal rates may decline as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction, customers\u2019 spending levels, decreased customer transaction volumes, increased competition, changes in tax laws or rules, pricing changes, deteriorating general economic conditions, or legislative changes affecting tax compliance providers. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions, or reduce the solutions or transaction volumes purchased under their subscriptions, our revenue may decline and our business may be harmed.\nOur future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional solutions and transaction volumes to existing customers. For example, many of our customers initially start with our AvaTax sales tax determination solution and then later combine that determination solution with one or more of our other solutions, such as returns preparation and filing, tax remittance, determination for additional tax types, or tax exemption certificate management. If our efforts to sell our additional solutions to our customers are not successful, it may decrease our revenue growth and harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers on a cost-effective basis, our business will be harmed.\nTo grow our business, we must continue to grow our customer base in a cost-effective manner. Increasing our customer base and achieving broader market acceptance of our solutions will depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to effectively expand our sales and marketing activities, as well as our partner network of business application providers and other customer referral sources. We may not be able to recruit qualified sales and marketing personnel, train them to perform, and achieve an acceptable level of sales production from them on a timely basis or at all. In the past, it has usually taken new members of our sales force at least six months to integrate into our operations and start converting sales leads at our expected levels. In addition, if we cannot continue to maintain or expand our relationships with our partner network, we may receive fewer referrals, the set of integrations we offer may not keep up with the market, and our customer acquisition strategy may become less effective. If we are unable to maintain effective sales and marketing activities and maintain and expand our partner network, our ability to attract new customers could be harmed, our sales and marketing expenses could increase substantially, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition may suffer.\nOur revenue growth rate may not be sustainable.\nOur revenue has grown rapidly, from $213.2 million in 2017, and $272.1 million in 2018, to $382.4 million in 2019. As our revenue base grows, we expect that our revenue growth rate will decline over time, and you should not rely on the revenue growth of any prior period as an indication of our future performance. This risk may increase with any future acquisition, particularly if the revenue growth rate of the acquired business has been lower than ours.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would likely be harmed.\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, rapid growth in our headcount and operations, both domestically and internationally, which has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our management and our administrative, operational, and financial reporting resources. We have also experienced significant growth in the number of customers, number of transactions, and the amount of tax content that our platform and solutions support. Our growth will require us to hire additional employees and make significant expenditures, particularly in sales and marketing but also in our technology, professional services, finance, and administration teams, as well as in our facilities and infrastructure. Our ability to effectively manage our growth will also require the allocation of valuable management and employee resources and improvements to our operational and financial controls and our reporting procedures and systems. In addition, as we seek to continue to expand internationally, we will likely encounter unexpected challenges and expenses due to unfamiliarity with local requirements, practices, and markets. Our expenses may increase more than we plan and we may fail to hire qualified personnel, expand our customer base, enhance our existing solutions, develop new solutions, integrate any acquisitions, satisfy the requirements of our existing customers, respond to competitive challenges, or otherwise execute our strategies. If we are unable to effectively manage our growth, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would likely be harmed.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the delivery of our sales and use tax determination solution, and any failure of this solution to satisfy customer demands or to achieve increased market acceptance could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects.\nWe currently derive a substantial portion of our revenue from subscriptions to our sales and use tax determination solution. We have added, and will continue to add, additional solutions to expand our offerings, but, at least in the near term, we expect to continue to derive the majority of our revenue from sales and use tax determination. As such, market acceptance of our sales and use tax determination solution is critical to our success. Demand for any of our solutions is affected by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as continued market acceptance of our solutions by existing and new customers, the timing of development and release of upgraded or new solutions on our platform, products and services introduced or upgraded by our competitors, pricing offered by our competitors, technological change, and growth or contraction in our addressable market. Revenue received as a certified provider in the Streamlined Sales Tax (\u201cSST\u201d) program also is subject to price negotiations with the SST Governing Board and its member states. If we are unable to meet customer demands to offer our sales and use tax determination solution in a manner that is effective and at a price that the market will accept, if SST payment rates were to decrease, or if we otherwise fail to achieve more widespread market acceptance of alternative solutions, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects will suffer.\nWe may not successfully develop or introduce new solutions that achieve market acceptance, or successfully integrate acquired products, services, or content with our existing solutions, and our business could be harmed and our revenue could suffer as a result.\nOur ability to attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers will likely depend upon the successful development, introduction, and customer acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our solutions and on our ability to integrate any products, services, and content that we may acquire into our existing and future solutions. Moreover, if we are unable to expand our solutions beyond our current transaction tax compliance solutions, our customers could migrate to competitors who may offer a broader or more attractive range of products and services. Our business could be harmed if we fail to deliver new versions, upgrades, or other enhancements to our existing solutions to meet customer needs on a timely and cost-effective basis. Unexpected delays in releasing new or enhanced versions of our solutions, or errors following their release, could result in loss of sales, delay in market acceptance of our solutions, or customer claims against us, any of which could harm our business. The success of any new solution depends on several factors, including timely completion, adequate quality testing, and market acceptance. We may not be able to develop new solutions successfully or to introduce and gain market acceptance of new solutions in a timely manner, or at all. Additionally, we must continually modify and enhance our solutions to keep pace with changes in hardware systems and software applications, database technology, and evolving technical standards and interfaces. As a result, uncertainties related to the timing and nature of business application providers, announcements or introductions of new solutions, or modifications by vendors of existing hardware systems or back-office or Internet-related software applications, could harm our business and cause our revenue to decline.\nOur business and success depend in part on our strategic relationships with third parties, including our partner ecosystem, and our business would be harmed if we fail to maintain or expand these relationships.\nWe depend on, and anticipate that we will continue to depend on, various third-party relationships to sustain and grow our business. We are highly dependent on relationships with third-party publishers of software business applications, including accounting, enterprise resource planning (ERP), ecommerce, point-of-sale (POS), recurring billing, and customer relationship management (CRM) systems, because the integration of our solutions with their applications allows us to reach their sizeable customer bases. Our sales and our customers\u2019 user experience are dependent on our ability to connect easily to such third-party software applications. We may fail to retain and expand these integrations or relationships for many reasons, including due to third parties\u2019 failure to maintain, support, or secure their technology platforms in general and our integrations in particular, or errors, bugs, or defects in their technology, or changes in their or our technology platforms. Any such failure could harm our relationship with our customers, our reputation and brand, and our business and results of operations.\nAs we seek to add different types of partners to our partner ecosystem, including integration partners, referral partners, Avalara Included Partners (who purchase our solutions to distribute to their customers), and professional service partners, it is uncertain whether these third parties will be successful in building integrations, co-marketing our solutions to provide a significant volume and quality of lead referrals and orders, and continuing to work with us as their own products evolve. Identifying, negotiating, and documenting relationships with additional partners requires significant resources. In addition, integrating third-party technology can be complex, costly, and time-consuming. Third parties may be unwilling to build integrations, and we may be required to devote additional resources to develop integrations for business applications on our own. Providers of business applications with which we have integrations may decide to compete with us or enter into arrangements with our competitors, resulting in such providers withdrawing support for our integrations. In addition, any failure of our solutions to operate effectively with business applications could reduce the demand for our solutions, resulting in customer dissatisfaction and harm to our business. If we are unable to respond to these changes or failures in a cost-effective manner, our solutions may become less marketable, less competitive, or obsolete, and our results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, we leverage the sales and referral resources of our network of referral partners through a variety of incentive programs. In the event that we are unable to effectively utilize, maintain, and expand these relationships, our revenue growth would slow, we would need to devote additional resources to the development, sales, and marketing of our solutions, and our financial results and future growth prospects would be harmed. Additionally, our referral partners may demand, or demand greater, referral fees or commissions.\nOur acquisitions of, and investments in, other businesses, products, or technologies may not yield expected benefits and our inability to successfully integrate acquisitions may negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have acquired a significant number of businesses, products, content (such as tax rate information), and technologies over the past several years, and we may acquire or invest in other businesses, products, content, or technologies in the future. Since 2014 we have acquired fuel and alcohol excise tax, lodging tax, communications tax, portions of European VAT, Brazil tax, cross-border transaction solutions, and artificial intelligence technology and expertise. We may not realize the anticipated benefits, or any benefits, from our past or future acquisitions. In addition, if we finance acquisitions by incurring debt or by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities, our existing shareholders may be diluted or we could face constraints related to the repayment of indebtedness, which could affect the market value of our capital stock. To the extent that the acquisition consideration is paid in the form of an earnout on future financial results, the success of such an acquisition will not be fully realized by us for a period of time as it is shared with the sellers. Further, if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed and the value of your investment may decline. For us to realize the benefits of past and future acquisitions, we must successfully integrate the acquired businesses, products, or technologies with ours, which may take time. Some of the challenges to successful integration of our acquisitions include:\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs or liabilities resulting from our acquisitions;\n\u2022\nretention of key employees from acquired businesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating acquired operations, personnel, technologies, products, or content;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management attention from business operations and strategy;\n\u2022\ndiversion of resources that are needed in other parts of our business;\n\u2022\npotential write-offs of acquired assets or investments;\n\u2022\ninability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs;\n\u2022\ninability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business;\n\u2022\ndifficulty of transitioning acquired technology and related infrastructures onto our existing platform;\n\u2022\nmaintaining security and privacy standards consistent with our other solutions;\n\u2022\npotential financial and credit risks associated with the acquired business or customers;\n\u2022\nthe need to implement controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company; and\n\u2022\nthe tax effects of any such acquisitions.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments and negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe face significant competition from other transaction tax compliance software providers and professional services firms, as well as the challenge of convincing businesses using do-it-yourself approaches to switch to our solutions.\nWe face significant competitive challenges from do-it-yourself approaches, outsourced transaction tax compliance services offered by accounting and specialized consulting firms, and tax-specific software vendors. Traditional do-it-yourself approaches are people-intensive and involve internal personnel manually performing compliance processes, often relying on transaction-specific research, static tax tables, non-tax specific software, or rate calculator services, as well as manual filing and remittance activities. Many businesses using do-it-yourself approaches believe that these manual processes are adequate and may be unaware that there is an affordable solution that is more effective, resulting in an inertia that can be difficult to overcome. In addition, the up-front costs of our solutions can limit our sales to businesses using do-it-yourself processes.\nIn addition, there are a number of competing tax-specific software vendors, some of which have substantially greater revenue, personnel, and other resources than we do. Our larger competitors, such as CCH Incorporated (a subsidiary of Wolters Kluwer NV), ONESOURCE Indirect Tax (a division of Thomson Reuters), Sovos, and Vertex, Inc., as well as the state and local tax services offered by large accounting firms, have historically targeted primarily large enterprise customers, but many of them also market to small to medium-sized businesses in search of growth in revenue or market share. In addition, our competitors who currently focus their tax compliance services on small to medium-sized businesses, such as TPS Unlimited, Inc. d/b/a TaxJar, may be better positioned than larger competitors to increase their market share with small to medium-sized businesses, whether competing based on price, service, or otherwise. We also face a growing number of competing private transaction tax compliance businesses focused primarily on ecommerce. Increased competition may impact our ability to add new customers at the rates we have historically achieved. It is also possible that large enterprises with substantial resources that operate in adjacent compliance, finance, or ecommerce verticals may decide to pursue transaction tax compliance automation and become immediate, significant competitors. Our failure to successfully and effectively compete with current or future competitors could lead to lost business and negatively affect our revenue growth.\nWe face significant risks in selling our solutions to enterprise customers, and if we do not manage these efforts effectively, our results of operations and ability to grow our customer base could be harmed.\nSales to enterprise customers typically involve higher customer acquisition costs and longer sales cycles and we may be less effective at predicting when we will complete these sales. The historical sales cycle and conversion rate trends associated with our existing customers, most of whom to date have been mid-market businesses, may not apply to larger enterprise businesses for whom purchasing decisions may require the approval of more technical personnel and management levels. This potential customer base may require us to invest more time educating prospects about the benefits of our solutions, causing our sales cycle to lengthen and become less predictable. In addition, larger customers may demand more integration services and customization, and our standard pricing model may be less attractive to certain customers with very high volumes of transactions. As a result of these factors, sales opportunities to larger businesses may require us to devote greater research and development, sales, support, and professional services resources to individual prospective customers, resulting in increased acquisition costs and strains on our limited resources. Moreover, these larger transactions may require us to delay recognizing the associated revenue we derive from these prospective customers until any technical or implementation requirements have been met. Furthermore, because we have limited experience selling to larger businesses, our investment in marketing our solutions to these potential customers may not be successful, which could harm our results of operations and our overall ability to grow our customer base.\nOur quarterly and annual results of operations are likely to fluctuate in future periods.\nWe expect to experience quarterly or annual fluctuations in our results of operations due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. This makes our future results difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations to fall below expectations or our predictions. Factors that might cause quarterly or annual fluctuations in our results of operations include:\n\u2022\nour ability to attract new customers and retain and grow revenue from existing customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain, expand, train, and achieve an acceptable level of production from our sales and marketing teams;\n\u2022\nour ability to find and nurture successful sales opportunities;\n\u2022\nthe timing of our introduction of new solutions or updates to existing solutions;\n\u2022\nour ability to grow and maintain our relationships with our network of third-party partners, including integration partners, referral partners, Avalara Included Partners, and professional service partners;\n\u2022\nthe success of our customers\u2019 businesses;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully sell to enterprise businesses;\n\u2022\nthe timing of large subscriptions and customer renewal rates;\n\u2022\nnew government regulation;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of our expenses related to the expansion of our business, operations, and infrastructure;\n\u2022\nany impairment of our intangible assets and goodwill;\n\u2022\nany seasonality in connection with new customer agreements, as well as renewal and upgrade agreements, each of which have historically occurred at a higher rate in the fourth quarter of each year;\n\u2022\nfuture costs related to acquisitions of content, technologies, or businesses and their integration; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions.\nAny one of the factors above, or the cumulative effect of some or all of the factors referred to above, may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results of operations. This variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet or exceed our internal operating plan. In addition, a percentage of our operating expenses is fixed in nature and is based on forecasted financial performance. In the event of revenue shortfalls, we may not be able to mitigate the negative impact on our results of operations quickly enough to avoid short-term impacts.\nBecause we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our solutions over the terms of the subscriptions and expense a portion of the commissions associated with sales of our solutions immediately upon execution of a subscription agreement with a customer, our financial results in any period may not be indicative of our financial health and future performance.\nWe generally recognize revenue from subscription fees paid by customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements. As a result, most of the subscription revenue we report in each quarter is the result of agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. Any such decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as subscription revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription terms.\nIn contrast, we expense a portion of the commissions paid to our sales personnel and to our referral partners in the period in which we enter into an agreement for the sale of our solutions. Beginning January 1, 2019, the Company recognizes an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if it expects the benefit of those costs to be greater than one year. These deferred costs are amortized to expense over a period of benefit of generally six years. Although we believe increased sales is a positive indicator of the long-term health of our business, increased sales could increase our operating expenses and decrease earnings in any particular period. Thus, we may report poor results of operations due to higher sales or customer referral source commissions in a period in which we experience strong sales of our solutions. Alternatively, we may report better results of operations due to the reduction of sales or customer referral source commissions in a period in which we experience a slowdown in sales. Therefore, you should not rely on our financial results during any one quarter as an indication of our financial health and future performance.\nOur business is substantially dependent upon the continued development of the market for cloud-based software solutions.\nWe derive, and expect to continue to derive, substantially all of our revenue from the sale of subscriptions for our cloud-based software solutions. The market for cloud-based software solutions is not as mature as the market for on-premises software applications. We do not know whether the trend of adoption of cloud-based software solutions that we have experienced in the past will continue in the future, and the adoption rate of cloud-based software solutions may be slower at companies in industries with heightened data security interests or sensitivity to communication network slowdowns or outages. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the widespread adoption of cloud-based software solutions in general, and of cloud-based tax software solutions in particular. Many businesses have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate on-premises software products into their businesses and have been reluctant or unwilling to migrate to cloud-based software solutions. Furthermore, many larger businesses have been reluctant or unwilling to use cloud-based solutions because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with the security of their data and the reliability of the technology and service delivery model associated with solutions like ours. In addition, if we or other cloud-based providers experience security incidents, loss of customer data, disruptions in delivery, or other problems, the market for cloud-based software solutions as a whole, including for our solutions, may be negatively impacted. If the market for these solutions stops developing or develops more slowly than we expect, our results of operations may be harmed.\nWe hold significant amounts of money that we remit to taxing authorities on behalf of our customers, and this may expose us to liability from errors, delays, fraud, or system failures, which may not be covered by insurance.\nWe handle significant amounts of our customers\u2019 money so that we can remit those amounts to various taxing jurisdictions on their behalf. If our banks\u2019 or our own internal compliance procedures regarding cash management fail, are hacked or sabotaged, or if our banks or we are the subject of fraudulent behavior by personnel or third parties, we could face significant financial losses. Our efforts to remit tax payments to applicable taxing jurisdictions only after receiving the corresponding funds from our customers may fail, which would expose us to the financial risk of collecting from our customers after we have remitted funds on their behalf.\nAdditionally, we are subject to risk from concentration of cash and cash equivalent accounts, including cash from our customers that is to be remitted to taxing jurisdictions, with financial institutions where deposits routinely exceed federal insurance limits. If the financial institutions in which we deposit our customers\u2019 cash were to experience insolvency or other financial difficulty, our access to cash deposits could be limited, any deposit insurance may not be adequate, we could lose our cash deposits entirely, and we could be exposed to liability to our customers. Any of these events would negatively impact our liquidity, results of operations, and our reputation.\nIf we make errors in our customers\u2019 transaction tax determinations, or remit their tax payments late or not at all, our reputation, results of operations, and growth prospects could suffer.\nThe tax determination functions we perform for customers are complicated from a data management standpoint, time-sensitive, and dependent on the accuracy of the database of tax content underlying our solutions. Some of our processes are not fully automated, such as our process for monitoring updates to tax rates and rules, and even to the extent our processes are automated, our solutions are not proven to be without any possibility of errors. If we make errors in our customers\u2019 tax determinations, or remit their tax payments late or not at all, our customers may be assessed interest and penalties. For example, as a certified provider in the Streamlined Sales Tax program we determine and remit sales taxes to certain states on behalf of our customers, and that agreement contains provisions detailing the circumstances under which we may become liable to member states in the event of delinquent payment of taxes. In a situation where the state is conducting a sales tax audit and our customer has declared bankruptcy or otherwise terminated operations before the appropriate documentation or tax liabilities have been remitted to the taxing jurisdiction, we could be held to be financially responsible for certain tax liabilities. For certain of our solutions, we guarantee the accuracy of the results or output provided by those solutions, and could be liable under such guarantee for up to 12 months\u2019 service fees for those solutions in the event of an error that results in uncollected taxes, penalties, or interest. Although our agreements have disclaimers of warranties and limit our liability (beyond the amounts we agree to pay pursuant to our guarantee, if applicable), a court could determine that such disclaimers and limitations are unenforceable as a matter of law and hold us liable for these errors. Further, in some instances we have negotiated agreements with specific customers or assumed agreements in connection with our acquisitions that do not limit this liability or disclaim these warranties. Additionally, erroneous tax determinations could result in overpayments to taxing authorities that are difficult to reclaim from the applicable taxing authorities. Any history of erroneous tax determinations or failures to timely remit tax payments for our customers could also cause our reputation to be harmed, could result in negative publicity, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our solutions, loss of customer renewals, and loss of competitive position. In addition, our errors and omissions insurance coverage may not cover all amounts claimed against us if such errors or failures occur. The financial and reputational costs associated with any erroneous tax determinations or failures to timely remit tax payments may be substantial and could harm our results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation or enforcement may cause us to invest substantial amounts to modify our solutions, cause us to change our business model, or draw new competitors to the market.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations or interpretations of existing taxation requirements in the United States or in other countries may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business and could harm our ability to attract and retain customers. For example, a material portion of our revenue is generated by performing what can be complex transaction tax determinations and corresponding preparation of tax returns and remittance of taxes. Changes in tax laws or regulations that reduce complexity or decrease the frequency of tax filings could negatively impact our revenue. In addition, there is considerable uncertainty as to if, when, and how tax laws and regulations might change. As a result, we may need to invest substantially to modify our solutions to adapt to new tax laws or regulations. If our platform and solutions are not flexible enough to adapt to changes in tax laws and regulations, our financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nFollowing the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., upholding South Dakota\u2019s economic nexus law, many states have begun requiring out-of-state retailers to collect sales taxes. Many states also have adopted or are considering marketplace facilitator laws that shift the burden of tax collection to online marketplaces. There also has been consideration of federal legislation related to taxation of interstate sales, which, if enacted into law, would place guidelines or restrictions on states\u2019 authority to require online and other out of state merchants to collect and remit sales and use tax on products and services that they may sell. Similar issues exist outside of the United States, where the application of value-added taxes or other indirect taxes on online retailers is uncertain and evolving. The effect of changes in tax laws and regulations is uncertain and dependent on a number of factors. Depending on the content of any sales tax legislation, the role of third-party compliance vendors may change, we may need to invest substantial amounts to modify our solutions or our business model, we could see a decrease in demand, we could see new competitors enter the market, or we could be negatively impacted by such legislation in a way not yet known.\nCybersecurity, data security, and data privacy breaches may create liability for us, damage our reputation, and harm our business.\nAs a cloud-based business, we face risks of cyber-attacks, computer break-ins, theft, misuse, denial-of-service attacks, and other improper activity that could jeopardize the performance of our platform and solutions and expose us to financial and reputational harm. Such harm could be in the form of theft of our or our customers\u2019 confidential information, the inability of our customers to access our systems, or the improper re-routing of customer funds through fraudulent transactions or other frauds perpetrated to obtain inappropriate payments and may result from accidental events (such as human error) or deliberate attacks. In some cases, we must rely on the safeguards put in place by third parties to protect against security threats. These third parties, including vendors that provide products and services for our operations, could also be a source of security risk to us in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure. Our network of business application providers could also be a source of vulnerability to the extent their business applications interface with ours, whether unintentionally or through a malicious backdoor. We do not review the software code included in third-party integrations in all instances. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we or these third parties may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. With the increasing frequency of cyber-related frauds to obtain inappropriate payments, we need to ensure our internal controls related to authorizing the transfer of funds are adequate. We may also be required to expend resources to remediate cyber-related incidents or to enhance and strengthen our cyber security. Any of these occurrences could create liability for us, put our reputation in jeopardy, and harm our business.\nOur customers provide us with information that our solutions store, some of which is confidential information about them or their financial transactions. In addition, we store personal information about our employees and, to a lesser extent, those who purchase products or services from our customers. We have security systems and information technology infrastructure designed to protect against unauthorized access to such information. The security systems and infrastructure we maintain may not be successful in protecting against all security breaches and cyber-attacks, social-engineering attacks, computer break-ins, theft, and other improper activity. Threats to our information technology security can take various forms, including viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attempt to attack our solutions or platform or to gain access to the data of our customers or their customers. Non-technical means, for example, actions or omissions by an employee, can also result in a security breach. Any significant violations of data privacy could result in the loss of business, litigation, regulatory investigations, loss of customers, and penalties that could damage our reputation and adversely affect the growth of our business.\nFailures in Internet infrastructure or interference with broadband or wireless access could cause current or potential customers to believe that our platform or solutions are unreliable, leading these customers to switch to our competitors or to avoid using our solutions, which could negatively impact our revenue or harm our opportunities for customer growth.\nOur solutions depend on our customers\u2019 high-speed broadband or wireless access to the Internet, particularly for our POS and ecommerce customers whose businesses require real time tax determinations. Increasing numbers of customers and bandwidth requirements may degrade the performance of our solutions due to capacity constraints and other Internet infrastructure limitations, and additional network capacity to maintain adequate data transmission speeds may be unavailable or unacceptably expensive. If adequate capacity is not available to us, our solutions may be unable to achieve or maintain sufficient data transmission, reliability, or performance. In addition, if Internet service providers and other third parties providing Internet services, including incumbent phone companies, cable companies, and wireless companies, have outages or suffer deterioration in their quality of service, our customers may not have access to or may experience a decrease in the quality of our solutions. These providers may take measures that block, degrade, discriminate, disrupt, or increase the cost of customer access to our solutions. Any of these disruptions to data transmission could lead customers to switch to our competitors or avoid using our solutions, which could negatively impact our revenue or harm our opportunities for growth.\nOur platform, solutions, and internal systems may be subject to disruption that could harm our reputation and future sales or result in claims against us.\nBecause our operations involve delivering a suite of transaction tax compliance solutions to our customers through a cloud-based software platform, our continued growth depends in part on the ability of our platform and related computer equipment, infrastructure, and systems to continue to support our solutions. In the past, we have experienced temporary and limited platform disruptions, outages in our solutions, and degraded levels of performance due to human and software errors, file corruption, and first and third-party capacity constraints associated with the number of customers accessing our platform simultaneously. While our past experiences have not materially impacted us, in the future we may face more extensive disruptions, outages, or performance problems. In addition, malicious third parties may also conduct attacks designed to sabotage our platform, impede the performance of our solutions, or temporarily deny customers access to our solutions. If an actual or perceived disruption, outage, performance problem, or attack occurs, it could:\n\u2022\nadversely affect the market perception of our solutions;\n\u2022\nharm our reputation;\n\u2022\ndivert the efforts of our technical and management personnel;\n\u2022\nimpair our ability to operate our business and provide solutions to our customers;\n\u2022\ncause us to lose customer information; or\n\u2022\nharm our customers\u2019 businesses.\nAny of these events may increase non-renewals, limit our ability to acquire new customers, result in delayed or withheld payments from customers, or result in claims against us.\nUndetected errors, bugs, or defects in our solutions could harm our reputation or decrease market acceptance of our solutions, which would harm our business and results of operations.\nOur solutions may contain undetected errors, bugs, or defects. We have experienced these errors, bugs, or defects in the past in connection with new solutions and solution upgrades and we expect that errors, bugs, or defects may be found from time to time in the future in new or enhanced solutions after their commercial release. Our solutions are often used in connection with large-scale computing environments with different operating systems, system management software, equipment, and networking configurations, which may cause or reveal errors or failures in our solutions or in the computing environments in which they are deployed. Despite testing by us, errors, bugs, or defects may not be found in our solutions until they are deployed to or used by our customers. In the past, we have discovered software errors, bugs, and defects in our solutions after they have been deployed to customers.\nSince our customers use our solutions for compliance reasons, any errors, bugs, defects, disruptions in service, or other performance problems with our solutions may damage our customers\u2019 business and could hurt our reputation. We may also be required, or may choose, for customer relations or other reasons, to expend additional resources to correct actual or perceived errors, bugs, or defects in our solutions. If errors, bugs, or defects are detected or perceived to exist in our solutions, we may experience negative publicity, loss of competitive position, or diversion of the attention of our key personnel; our customers may delay or withhold payment to us or elect not to renew their subscriptions; or other significant customer relations problems may arise. We may also be subject to liability claims, including pursuant to our accuracy guarantee, for damages related to errors, bugs, or defects in our solutions. A material liability claim or other occurrence that harms our reputation or decreases market acceptance of our solutions may harm our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party computer hardware, software, content, and services for use in our solutions. Errors and defects, or failure to successfully integrate or license necessary third-party software, content, or services, could cause delays, errors, or failures of our solutions, increases in our expenses, and reductions in our sales, which could harm our results of operations.\nWe rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from, software licensed from, content licensed from, and services provided by a variety of third parties to offer our solutions, including database, operating system, virtualization software, tax requirement content, and geolocation content and services. Any errors, bugs, or defects in third-party hardware, software, content, or services could result in errors or a failure of our solutions, which could harm our business. For example, in the past, we experienced a period of higher than usual latency and outages that impacted some customers resulting from a third-party provider data center infrastructure failure. In the future, we might need to license other hardware, software, content, or services to enhance our solutions and meet evolving customer requirements. Any inability to use hardware or software could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays, a reduction in functionality, or errors or failures of our products until equivalent technology is either developed by us or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license, and integrated into our solutions, any of which may reduce demand for our solutions. In addition, third-party licenses may expose us to increased risks, including risks associated with the integration of new technology, the diversion of resources from the development of our own proprietary technology, and our inability to generate revenue from new technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs, all of which may increase our expenses and harm our results of operations.\nWe rely upon data centers and other systems and technologies provided by third parties to operate our business, and interruptions or performance problems with these centers, systems, and technologies may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe rely on data centers and other technologies and services provided by third parties in order to operate our business. We currently operate both physical data centers supported by Equinix and cloud data centers supported by Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d) and Microsoft Azure. If any of our data centers become unavailable or otherwise are unable to serve our requirements, there could be a failover recovery latency.\nOur business depends on our ability to protect the growing amount of information stored in our data centers and related systems, offices, and hosting facilities, against damage from earthquake, floods, fires, other extreme weather conditions, power loss, telecommunications failures, hardware failures, unauthorized intrusion, overload conditions, and other events. If our data centers or related systems fail to operate properly or become disabled even for a brief period of time, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our business, liability to customers, or damage to our reputation. Our response to any type of disaster may not be successful in preventing the loss of customer data, service interruptions, and disruptions to our operations, or damage to our important facilities.\nMost of our current cloud service infrastructure is run on AWS and neither AWS nor our other data center providers are obligated to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and it is possible that we will not be able to switch our operations to another provider in a timely and cost-effective manner should the need arise. If we are unable to renew our agreements with any of our data center providers on commercially reasonable terms, or if in the future we add data center facility providers, we may face additional costs or expenses or downtime, which could harm our business.\nAny unavailability of, or failure to meet our requirements by, third-party data centers, technologies, or services, could impede our ability to provide services to our customers, harm our reputation, subject us to potential liabilities, result in contract terminations, and adversely affect our customer relationships. Any of these circumstances could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIncorrect or improper implementation, integration, or use of our solutions could result in customer dissatisfaction and negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects.\nOur solutions are deployed in a wide variety of technology environments and integrated into a broad range of complex workflows and third-party software. If we or our customers are unable to implement our solutions successfully, are unable to do so in a timely manner, or our integration partners are unable to integrate with our solutions through our integrations, customer perceptions of our solutions may be impaired, our reputation and brand may suffer, and customers may choose not to renew or expand the use of our solutions.\nOur customers may need training or education in the proper use of and the variety of benefits that can be derived from our solutions to maximize their potential benefits. If our solutions are not implemented or used correctly or as intended, inadequate performance may result. Because our customers rely on our solutions to manage a wide range of tax compliance operations, the incorrect or improper implementation or use of our solutions, or our failure to provide adequate support to our customers, may result in negative publicity or legal claims against us, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Also, as we continue to expand our customer base, any failure by us to properly provide training and support will likely result in lost opportunities for additional subscriptions for our solutions.\nIf we fail to effectively maintain and enhance our brand, our business may suffer.\nWe believe that continuing to strengthen our brand will be critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our solutions and will require continued focus on active marketing efforts. We may need to increase our investment in, and devote greater resources to, sales, marketing, and other efforts to create and maintain brand awareness among customers. Our brand awareness efforts will require investment not just in our core U.S. sales tax determination service, but also in newer services we have developed or acquired, such as our excise or lodging tax services, and in foreign markets. The demand for and cost of online and traditional advertising have been increasing and may continue to increase. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses incurred in building our brand. If we fail to promote and maintain our brand, or if we incur substantial expense in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand, our business could suffer.\nChanges in the application, scope, interpretation, or enforcement of laws and regulations pertaining to our business may harm our business or results of operations, subject us to liabilities, and require us to implement new compliance programs or business methods.\nWe perform a number of critical business functions for our customers, including remittance of the taxes our customers owe to taxing authorities. Our electronic payment of customers\u2019 taxes may be subject to federal or state laws or regulations relating to money transmission. The federal Bank Secrecy Act requires that financial institutions, of which money transmitters are a subset, register with the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to monitor, identify, report and, where possible, avoid money laundering and criminal or terrorist financing by customers. Most U.S. states also have laws that apply to money transmitters, and impose various licensure, examination, and bonding requirements on them. We believe these federal and state laws and regulations were not intended to cover the business activity of remitting transaction taxes that taxpayers owe to the various states. However, if federal or state regulators were to apply these laws and regulations to this business activity, whether through expansion of enforcement activities, new interpretations of the scope of certain of these laws or regulations or of available exemptions, or otherwise, or if our activities are held by a court to be covered by such laws or regulations, we could be required to expend time, money, and other resources to deal with enforcement actions and any penalties that might be asserted, to institute and maintain a compliance program specific to money transmission laws, and possibly to change aspects of how we conduct business to achieve compliance or minimize regulation. Application of these laws to our business could also make it more difficult or costly for us to maintain our banking relationships. Financial institutions may also be unwilling to provide banking services to us due to concerns about the large dollar volume moving into and out of our accounts on behalf of our customers in the ordinary course of our business. As we continue to expand the solutions we offer and the jurisdictions in which we offer them, we could become subject to other licensing, examination, or regulatory requirements relating to financial services.\nDetermining the transaction taxes owed by our customers involves providing our platform with the types and prices of products they sell, as well as information regarding addresses that products are shipped from and delivered to. Our tax exemption certificate management solution also requires input of certain information regarding the purchasers who are entitled to tax exemptions. Numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, and safeguarding of certain personal information. Additional laws and regulations have been proposed or enacted that would impose new requirements with respect to personal information. Although most of the data that is provided to our services by our customers cannot be used to identify individual consumers, we are subject to these laws in certain circumstances. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, which became effective on January 1, 2020, imposes restrictions on companies\u2019 use of personal data. Most states have also adopted data security breach laws that require notice be given to affected consumers in the event of a security breach. In the event of a security breach, our compliance with these laws may subject us to costs associated with\nnotice and remediation, as well as potential investigations from federal regulatory agencies and state attorneys general. A failure on our part to safeguard consumer data adequately or to destroy data securely would subject us, depending on the personal information in question, to costs associated with notice and remediation, as well as potential regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, and possibly to civil liability, under federal or state data security or unfair practices or consumer protection laws. If federal or state regulators were to expand their enforcement activities, or change their interpretation of the applicability of these laws, or if new laws regarding privacy and protection of consumer data were to be adopted, the burdens and costs of complying with them could increase significantly, harming our results of operations and possibly the manner in which we conduct our business.\nAs our business increasingly involves dealings with foreign customers or compliance with foreign tax regimes, we also are subject to data security and privacy protection requirements in foreign jurisdictions. For example, the European Union (the E.U.) adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective on May 25, 2018. This regulation requires certain operational changes for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the E.U. and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. Moreover, Brazil\u2019s General Data Protection Law will impose detailed rules for the collection, use, processing, and storage of personal data in Brazil when it becomes effective in August 2020. In addition, on December 11, 2019, India\u2019s Minister for Electronics and Information Technology introduced an updated draft of its personal data protection bill in India\u2019s lower house of Parliament. Other governmental authorities around the world are considering implementing similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. We may incur significant costs to comply with these mandatory privacy and security standards.\nEconomic conditions and regulatory changes resulting from the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOn January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (the U.K.) exited from the E.U., commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d The impact of Brexit is uncertain, but it has the potential to significantly disrupt the free movement of goods, services, and people between the U.K., the E.U., and other nations, increase legal and regulatory complexities, increase costs of conducting business in Europe, and lead to global economic uncertainty. Because we have based our European operations in the U.K., any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe may not be able to secure financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs, which could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nFrom time to time, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings. The success of any future financing efforts depends on many factors outside of our control, including market forces, investment banking trends, and demand by investors. We may not be successful in raising additional capital on favorable terms when we require it. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may suffer.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of approximately $651.9 million due to prior period losses. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its NOLs to offset future taxable income. Our existing NOLs may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes. Future changes in our stock ownership, the causes of which may be outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Our NOLs may also be impaired under state laws. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. For these reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs, whether or not we attain profitability.\nIf we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business could be harmed.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract, integrate, motivate, and retain highly qualified personnel at a reasonable cost, particularly sales and marketing personnel, software developers, technical support, and research and development personnel on the terms we desire. Competition for skilled personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting, motivating, and retaining needed personnel. We also may be unable to attract or integrate into our operations qualified personnel on the schedule we desire. Our inability to attract, integrate, motivate, and retain the necessary personnel could harm our business. Dealing with the loss of the services of our executive officers or key personnel and the process to replace any of our executive officers or key personnel may involve significant time and expense, take longer than anticipated, and significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives, which would harm our financial condition, results of operations, and business.\nWe need to continue making significant investments in software development and equipment to improve our business.\nTo improve the scalability, security, efficiency, and failover aspects of our solutions, and to support the expansion of our solutions into other tax types, such as international VAT, additional excise taxes, or additional lodging taxes, we will need to continue making significant capital equipment expenditures and also invest in additional software and infrastructure development. If we experience increasing demand in subscriptions, we may not be able to augment our infrastructure quickly enough to accommodate such increasing demand. In the event of decreases in subscription sales, certain of our fixed costs, such as for capital equipment, may make it difficult for us to adjust our expenses downward quickly. Additionally, we are continually updating our software and content, creating expenses for us. We may also need to review or revise our software architecture as we grow, which may require significant resources and investments.\nIf economic conditions worsen, it may negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nOur financial performance depends, in part, on the state of the economy. Declining levels of economic activity may lead to declines in spending and fewer transactions for which transaction tax is due, which may result in decreased revenue for us. Concern about the strength of the economy may slow the rate at which businesses of all sizes are willing to hire an outside vendor to perform the determination and remittance of their transaction taxes and filing of related returns. If our customers and potential customers experience financial hardship as a result of a weak economy, industry consolidation, or other factors, the overall demand for our solutions could decrease. If economic conditions worsen, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed.\nSales to customers or operations outside the United States may expose us to risks inherent in international sales.\nHistorically, transactions occurring outside of the United States have represented a very small portion of our transactions processed. However, we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts, including through our sales operations in Europe, India, and Brazil. Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic, and political risks that are different from those in the United States. Because of our limited experience with international operations, our international expansion efforts may not be successful. We may rely heavily on third parties outside of the United States, in which event we may be harmed if we invest time and resources into such business relationships but do not see significant sales from such efforts. Potential risks and challenges associated with sales to customers and operations outside the United States include:\n\u2022\ncompliance with multiple conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, money transmission, privacy, and data protection laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local competitors;\n\u2022\nnew and different sources of competition;\n\u2022\nsecuring new integrations for international technology platforms;\n\u2022\nlocalization of our solutions, including translation into foreign languages, obtaining and maintaining local content, and customer care in various native languages;\n\u2022\ntreatment of revenue from international sources and changes to tax rules, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding of income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nfluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\ndifferent pricing environments;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\navailability of reliable broadband connectivity in areas targeted for expansion;\n\u2022\ndifferent or lesser protection of our intellectual property;\n\u2022\nlonger sales cycles;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics, or security breaches;\n\u2022\ncompliance with various anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022\nregional or national economic and political conditions; and\n\u2022\npressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations resulting from liquidity issues or political actions.\nAny of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nOur ability to protect our intellectual property is limited and our solutions are, and may in the future be, subject to claims of infringement by third parties.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology, processes, trade secrets, and other proprietary information and our ability to protect this information from unauthorized disclosure and use. We primarily rely upon a combination of confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, and other similar measures to protect our proprietary information and intellectual property. We also use patents, including those of our acquired businesses, to protect certain of our intellectual property. Our trademarks and service marks include Avalara, the Avalara logo, AvaTax, the Avalara Compliance Cloud, \u201cTax compliance done right,\u201d marks for our acquired businesses, and various marketing slogans. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our solutions or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary, and third parties may attempt to develop similar technology independently. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate.\nIn addition, third parties have claimed, and may in the future claim, infringement by us with respect to current or future solutions or other intellectual property rights. See \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding recent litigation. The software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks, and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any existing or future claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or licensing discussions, or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our strategies, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims, and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages, or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. Any adverse determination related to any existing or future intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our solutions to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise harm our results of operations.\nIndemnity provisions in our subscription agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses.\nIn many of our subscription agreements with our customers, we agree to indemnify our customers against any losses or costs incurred in connection with claims by a third party alleging that a customer\u2019s use of our solutions infringes on the intellectual property rights of the third party. Customers facing infringement claims may in the future seek indemnification from us under the terms of our contracts. If such claims are successful, or if we are required to indemnify or defend our customers from these or other claims, these matters could be disruptive to our business and management and harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe use open source software in our platform and solutions, which may subject us to litigation or other actions that could harm our business.\nWe use open source software in our platform and solutions, and we may use more open source software in the future. In the past, companies that have incorporated open source software into their products have faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software or compliance with open source license terms. Accordingly, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming noncompliance with open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require users who incorporate open source software as part of their software or services to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. If applicable, such licenses could require us to release our proprietary source code, pay damages, re-engineer our applications, discontinue sales, or take other remedial action, any of which could harm our business. In addition, if the license terms for updated or enhanced versions of the open source software we utilize change, we may be forced to re-engineer our platform or solutions or incur additional costs.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been and likely will continue to be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance, resulting in substantial losses for investors in our common stock.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate significantly regardless of our operating performance, in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u2022\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022\nfailure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our company, changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, results of operations, or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nchanges in our Board of Directors or management;\n\u2022\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors, or significant shareholders;\n\u2022\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nthe expiration of contractual lock-up agreements;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of debt or equity securities;\n\u2022\nshort sales, hedging, and other derivative transactions involving our capital stock;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions in the United States and internationally;\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, or responses to these events; and\n\u2022\nthe other factors described in these risk factors.\nIn addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, shareholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nAs of December 31, 2019, there were 7,393,023 shares of common stock issuable upon vesting and exercise of outstanding options and vesting of outstanding RSUs. In connection with our initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d), we filed a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register shares of our common stock issued or reserved for issuance under our equity compensation plans and agreements. Accordingly, these shares will be able to be freely sold in the public market upon issuance as permitted by any applicable securities laws and applicable vesting requirements. We are unable to predict the effect that such sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nCertain holders of our common stock are entitled to rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares, or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or our shareholders.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish inaccurate or negative reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business, our market, and our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or publish inaccurate or negative reports about our business, our share price would likely decline. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention, affect our ability to attract and retain additional executive management and qualified board members, and result in litigation.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased our legal and financial compliance costs, made some activities more difficult, time-consuming, or costly, and increased demand on our systems and resources, and such costs and demands may increase further. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we timely file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Significant resources and management oversight will be required to improve and maintain our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and results of operations. Although we already have hired additional employees to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees or engage outside consultants to comply with these requirements, increasing our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs, and making some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from other business concerns. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards do not meet the standards intended by regulatory or governing bodies, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may suffer.\nBeing a public company also has made it more expensive for us to obtain and maintain director and officer liability insurance, and, in the future, we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our Audit Committee and our Compensation and Leadership Development Committee.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting that led to several significant deficiencies and have identified a material weakness and significant deficiencies in the past. If we fail to remediate this material weakness and related significant deficiencies or if we experience additional material weaknesses in the future or fail to otherwise maintain effective financial reporting systems and processes, we may be unable to accurately and timely report our financial results or comply with the requirements of being a public company, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline and harm our business.\nWe identified a material weakness due to a lack of adequate controls to effectively design, implement, and operate process-level and information technology controls to sufficiently mitigate risks of material misstatement associated with certain complex business processes and changes in those processes or applicable accounting standards. This material weakness led to the following individual significant deficiencies:\n\u2022\nDesign and implementation of controls over a portion of the underlying data used to derive the accounting entries related to the adoption of ASC 606;\n\u2022\nDesign and implementation of control activities to address changes in ongoing revenue and deferred commission accounting following the adoption of ASC 606;\n\u2022\nDesign and implementation of controls related to the enforcement of segregation of duties in key areas of financial reporting, including sales order pricing and approvals; and\n\u2022\nOperating effectiveness of controls related to the review of manual journal entries.\nWe cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, and are continuing to implement, will be sufficient to remediate this material weakness and significant deficiencies or to avoid potential future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Moreover, we cannot be certain that we will not in the future have additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting, or that we will successfully remediate any that we find. In addition, the processes and systems we have developed to date have not been fully tested, and they may not be adequate. Accordingly, there could continue to be a reasonable possibility that the material weakness we have identified or other material weaknesses or deficiencies could result in a misstatement of our accounts or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of our financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, or cause us to fail to meet our obligations to file periodic financial reports on a timely basis. Any of these failures could result in adverse consequences that could materially and adversely affect our business, including an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock, potential action by the SEC against us, shareholder lawsuits, delisting of our stock, and general damage to our reputation.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Washington law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult and limit attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation, or our Articles, and our amended and restated bylaws, or our Bylaws, include a number of provisions that may have the effect of deterring takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management that a shareholder might deem to be in his or her best interest. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\nour Board of Directors may issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with any rights or preferences as it may designate;\n\u2022\nour Articles and Bylaws provide (1) for the division of our Board of Directors into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible, with the directors in each class serving for three-year terms, and one class being elected each year by our shareholders, (2) that a director may only be removed from the Board of Directors for cause by the affirmative vote of our shareholders, (3) that vacancies on our Board of Directors may be filled only by the Board of Directors, and (4) that only our Board of Directors may change the size of our Board of Directors, which provisions together generally make it more difficult for shareholders to replace a majority of our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nWashington law, our Articles, and Bylaws limit the ability of shareholders from acting by written consent by requiring unanimous written consent for shareholder action to be effective;\n\u2022\nour Bylaws limit who may call a special meeting of shareholders to our Board of Directors, chairperson of our Board of Directors, chief executive officer, or president;\n\u2022\nour Bylaws provide that shareholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of shareholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of shareholders must provide timely advance written notice to us, and specify requirements as to the form and content of a shareholder\u2019s notice, which may preclude shareholders from bringing matters before a meeting of shareholders or from making nominations for directors at a meeting of shareholders;\n\u2022\nour Articles do not provide for cumulative voting for our directors, which may make it more difficult for shareholders owning less than a majority of our capital stock to elect any members to our Board of Directors; and\n\u2022\nour Articles and Bylaws provide that shareholders can amend or repeal the Bylaws only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting power of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single group.\nAdditionally, unless approved by a majority of our \u201ccontinuing directors,\u201d as that term is defined in our Articles, specified provisions of our Articles may not be amended or repealed without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting power of our capital stock entitled to vote on the action, voting together as a single group, including the following provisions:\n\u2022\nthose providing that shareholders can amend or repeal the Bylaws only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting power of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single group;\n\u2022\nthose providing for the division of our Board of Directors into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible, with the directors in each class serving for three-year terms, and one class being elected each year by our shareholders;\n\u2022\nthose providing that a director may only be removed from the Board of Directors for cause by the affirmative vote of our shareholders;\n\u2022\nthose providing that vacancies on our Board of Directors may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office or by the sole remaining director;\n\u2022\nthose providing that only our Board of Directors may change the size of our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nthose requiring the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting power of our capital stock entitled to vote on the action, voting together as a single group, to amend or repeal specified provisions of our Articles; and\n\u2022\nthose that limit who may call a special meeting of shareholders to only our Board of Directors, chairperson of our Board of Directors, chief executive officer, or president.\nThe provisions described above may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for shareholders to replace members of our Board of Directors, which is responsible for appointing our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in the State of Washington, we are governed by the provisions of Chapter 23B.19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act, which prohibits certain business combinations between us and certain significant shareholders unless specified conditions are met. These provisions may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company, even if this change in control would benefit our shareholders.\nWe have never paid cash dividends and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation of our business and do not anticipate paying any dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock may be prohibited or limited by the terms of future debt financing arrangements.", "PERMNO": 17855, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "AVLR"}
