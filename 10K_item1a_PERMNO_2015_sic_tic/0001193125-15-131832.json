RISK FACTORS.\nOur business is challenged by a changing environment that involves many known and unknown risks and uncertainties. The risks described below discuss factors that have affected and/or could affect us in the future. There may be others. We may be affected by risks that are currently unknown to us or are immaterial at this time. If any such events did occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in a material manner. Our future results may also be impacted by other risk factors listed from time to time in our future filings with the SEC, including, but not limited to, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.\nSoft demand for electrical power may cause deterioration in our financial outlook.\nThe sluggish economic recovery in the United States may continue to result in a lackluster demand for electrical power in the United States. Soft demand growth for power and a slowdown in the anticipated pace of the retirement of coal-fired and/or nuclear power plants could result in the delay, curtailment or cancellation of future gas-fired power plant projects, thus decreasing the overall demand for our services and adversely impacting our financial outlook. In addition, project owners may experience difficulty in raising capital for the construction of power-generation plants and renewable fuel production facilities due to substantial limitations on the availability of credit and other factors including uncertainty regarding the availability of future government subsidies. In general, if overall economic conditions do not improve steadily, the demand for our EPC contract services may be adversely affected.\nOur future revenues and earnings are dependent on the award of new contracts which we do not directly control.\nDue primarily to the favorable operating results of GPS, we have generated income for seven consecutive years - the fiscal years ended January 31, 2009 through 2015. As described in the risks presented below, our ability to maintain profitable operations depends on many factors including the ability of the power industry services business segment to continue to obtain significant new EPC projects and to complete its projects successfully.\n- 8 -\nOur dependence on one or a few customers could adversely affect us.\nThe size of the energy plant construction projects of our power industry services segment frequently results in a limited number of projects contributing a substantial portion of our consolidated revenues each year as described in Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Should we fail to replace projects that are completed by GPS with new projects, future revenues and profits may be adversely affected.\nOur dependence on large construction contracts may result in uneven quarterly financial results.\nOur power industry service activities in any one fiscal quarter are typically concentrated on a few large construction projects for which we use the percentage-of-completion accounting method to determine corresponding revenues. To a substantial extent, our contract revenues are recognized as services are provided as measured by the amount of costs incurred. As the timing of equipment purchases, subcontractor services and other contract events may not be evenly distributed over the lives of our contracts, the amount of total contract costs may vary from quarter to quarter, creating uneven amounts of quarterly consolidated revenues. In addition, the timing of contract commencements and completions may exacerbate the uneven pattern. As a result of the foregoing, future amounts of consolidated revenues, cash flow from operations, net income and earnings per share reported on a quarterly basis may vary in an uneven pattern and may not be indicative of the operating results expected for any other quarter or for an entire fiscal year, thus rendering consecutive quarter comparisons of our consolidated operating results a less meaningful way to assess the growth of our business.\nLawsuits could adversely affect our business.\nFrom time to time, we, our directors and/or certain of our current officers may be named as parties to lawsuits. It is not possible at this time to predict the likely outcome of legal actions with certainty, and an adverse result in any lawsuit against us could have a material adverse effect on us. Litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, proceedings may occur over several years and the outcomes are typically difficult to predict. Any claim that is successfully asserted against us could result in significant damage claims and other losses. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations over multi-year periods, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may be unsuccessful at generating internal growth which could result in an overall decline in our business.\nOur ability to expand by achieving profitable organic growth of the Company will be affected by, among other factors, our success in:\n\u2022\nexpanding the range of services and products we offer to customers in order to address their evolving needs;\n\u2022\nattracting new customers;\n\u2022\nhiring and retaining employees; and\n\u2022\ncontrolling operating and overhead expenses.\nMany of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth may be beyond our control. Our strategies may not be successful and we may not be able to generate cash flow sufficient to fund our operations and to support internal growth. Our inability to achieve internal growth could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture acquisitions and/or investments may not occur which could limit the growth of our business.\nWe are a holding company with no operations other than our investments in GPS and SMC. We want to make additional acquisitions and/or investments that would provide positive cash flow to us and value to our stockholders. However, additional companies meeting these criteria and that provide products and/or services in growth industries similar to ours and that are available for purchase at attractive prices are difficult to find. Discussions with the principal(s) of potential acquisition targets may be protracted and ultimately terminated for a variety of reasons. Further, due diligence investigations of attractive target companies may uncover unfavorable data, and the negotiation and consummation of acquisition agreements may not be successful.\n- 9 -\nWe cannot readily predict the timing or size of any future acquisitions or the capital we will need for these transactions. However, it is likely that any potential future acquisition or strategic investment transaction would require the use of cash and/or shares of our common stock as components of the purchase price. Using cash for acquisitions may limit our financial flexibility and make us more likely to seek additional capital through future debt or equity financings. Our ability to obtain such additional financing in the future may depend upon prevailing capital market conditions, the strength of our future operating results and financial condition as well as conditions in our business, and the amount of outside financing sought by us. These factors may affect our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us. Our ability to use shares of our common stock as future acquisition consideration may be limited by a variety of factors, including the future market price of shares of our common stock and a potential seller\u2019s assessment of the liquidity of our common stock. If adequate funds or the use of our common stock are not available to us, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of desirable acquisitions or other investment opportunities that would benefit our business.\nThe Bank\u2019s consent is required for acquisitions, divestitures, the participation in joint ventures and certain other investments. There can be no assurance that our Bank will consent to future transactions. If we are unable to obtain such consents, our ability to consummate acquisitions, to make investments or to enter into other arrangements for the purpose of growing our business may be limited.\nThe integration of acquired companies may not be successful.\nEven if we do complete acquisitions in the future, acquired companies may fail to achieve the results we anticipate including the expected gross profit percentages. In addition, we may not be able to successfully integrate such acquired companies with our other operations without substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial problems including:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other important operational matters;\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies;\n\u2022\ninability to retain key personnel of acquired companies;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities;\n\u2022\nthe potential disruptions to our current business; and\n\u2022\ndifficulty in the maintenance of uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, including an effective system of internal control over financial reporting.\nIf one of our acquired companies suffers customer dissatisfaction or performance problems, the reputation of our entire Company could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, future acquisitions could result in issuances of equity securities that would reduce our stockholders\u2019 ownership interests, the issuance of sizable amounts of debt and the incurrence of contingent liabilities. In summary, integrating acquired companies involves a number of special risks which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of impairment losses related to goodwill and other purchased intangible assets.\nWhen we acquire a business, we typically record goodwill equal to the excess amount paid for the business, including liabilities assumed, over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business. Generally accepted accounting principles require that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and that certain intangible assets acquired in a business combination be recognized as assets apart from goodwill. The balances of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but instead are evaluated at least annually for impairment. The amounts of intangible assets that do have finite lives are amortized over their useful lives. However, should poor performance or any other condition indicate that the carrying value of a business or long-lived asset may have suffered impairment, a determination of fair value is required to be performed in the period that such a condition exists. If the carrying value of a business or of an individual purchased intangible asset is found to exceed the corresponding fair value, an impairment loss is recorded.\nThe aggregate carrying amount of goodwill, other purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives and long lived purchased intangible assets included in our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2015 was approximately $20.3 million, or approximately 5.2% of total consolidated assets and 11.6% of consolidated net assets. We have continued to perform annual\n- 10 -\nassessments for impairment of the carrying values of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as of November 1. Assessments of these assets as well as our long-lived assets may be conducted more frequently if we identify indications of impairment. Should the operating results of GPS or any future acquired company experience unexpected deterioration, we could be required to record impairment losses related to purchased intangible assets. Impairment losses, if any, would be recognized as operating expenses and would adversely affect future profitability.\nOur continued success requires us to retain and hire talented personnel.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the continued service and performance of the members of our current executive team and the senior management members of our businesses. We cannot be certain that any such individual will continue in such capacity or continue to perform at a high level for any particular period of time. Our ability to operate productively and profitably, particularly in the power services industry, may also be limited by our ability to attract, employ, retain and train skilled personnel necessary to meet our future requirements. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain management teams and an adequate skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy or that our labor expenses will not increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of these skilled personnel. Labor shortages or increased labor costs could impair our ability or maintain our business or grow our revenues. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees in the future, could negatively impact our ability to manage our business.\nOur actual business and financial results could differ from the estimates, assumptions and judgments that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements, which may reduce our profits.\nTo prepare consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, we are required to make estimates, assumptions and judgments as of the date of such financial statements, which affect the reported values of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. For example, we recognize revenues over the life of a contract based on the proportion of costs incurred to date compared to the total costs estimated to be incurred for the entire project. We review and make necessary revisions to such costs on a monthly basis. In addition, contract results may be impacted by our estimates of the amounts of change orders that we expect to receive and our assessment of any contract claims that may arise.\nOther areas requiring significant estimates by our management include:\n\u2022\nthe identification of the significant beneficiary of entities in which we may have variable interests;\n\u2022\nthe valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations;\n\u2022\nthe assessment of the value of goodwill and recoverability of other purchased intangible assets;\n\u2022\nprovisions for income taxes and related valuation allowances associated with deferred income tax assets;\n\u2022\naccruals for estimated liabilities, including losses and expenses related to legal matters;\n\u2022\nthe adequacy of allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable; and\n\u2022\nthe determination of stock-based compensation expense amounts.\nOur actual business and financial results could differ from those estimates, which may reduce our profits.\nOur employees work on projects that are inherently dangerous and a failure to maintain a safe work site could result in significant losses.\nWe often work on large-scale and complex projects, frequently in geographically remote locations. Our project sites can place our employees and others near large and/or mechanized equipment, high voltage electrical equipment, moving vehicles, dangerous processes or highly regulated materials, and in challenging environments. Safety is a primary focus of our business and is critical to our reputation. Often, we are responsible for safety on the project sites where we work. Many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid on contracts. We maintain programs with the primary purpose of implementing effective health, safety and environmental procedures throughout our Company. If we fail to implement appropriate safety procedures and/or if our procedures fail, our employees or others may suffer injuries. The failure to comply with such procedures, client contracts or applicable regulations could subject us to losses and liability, and adversely impact our ability to obtain projects in the future.\n- 11 -\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our operating results could be harmed. We devote significant attention to establishing and maintaining effective internal controls. Implementing changes to our internal controls required compliance training for our officers and employees. Substantial costs have been incurred and significant efforts have been expended by us in order to evaluate, test and remediate our internal controls over financial reporting. We cannot be certain that these present and future measures will ensure that we will successfully implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial reporting processes and related reporting requirements.\nAny failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could affect our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and could result in a breach of a covenant in our Bank financing arrangements in future periods. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe rely on information systems to conduct our business, and failure to protect these systems against security breaches could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, if these systems fail or become unavailable for any significant period of time, our business could be harmed.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on computer hardware and software systems. Information systems are vulnerable to operational malfunctions and security breaches by computer hackers and cyber terrorists. We rely on industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential and proprietary information retained on our information systems. However, these measures and technology may not adequately prevent unanticipated downtime or security breaches. The unavailability of the information systems or the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and could result in decreased performance and increased overhead costs, causing our business and results of operations to suffer. Any significant interruption or failure of our information systems or any significant breach of security could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nFailure to successfully operate our power industry services business will adversely affect us.\nThe operations of our power industry services business conducted by GPS represent a significant portion of our revenues and profits. The revenues of this business segment were approximately $377 million for the year ended January 31, 2015, representing 98% of consolidated revenues. Income from these operations before income taxes for the year ended January 31, 2015 exceeded $70 million. Our inability to successfully manage and grow our power industry services business will adversely affect our consolidated operating results and financial condition.\nIntense competition in the engineering and construction industry could reduce our market share and profits.\nWe serve markets that are highly competitive and in which a large number of multinational companies compete. In particular, the engineering and construction markets are highly competitive and require substantial resources and capital investment in equipment, technology and skilled personnel. Competition also places downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins. Intense competition is expected to continue in these markets, presenting us with significant challenges in our ability to maintain strong growth rates and acceptable profit margins. If we are unable to meet these competitive challenges and replace completed projects with new customers or projects, we could lose market share to our competitors and experience an overall reduction in future revenues and profits.\nOur backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments, delays and cancellations, and may be an uncertain indicator of future revenues.\nAs of January 31, 2015, the value of the construction contract backlog of GPS was $423 million compared with a backlog value of $790 million as of January 31, 2014. Projects awarded to us may remain included in our backlog for an extended period of time. In addition, project cancellations or scope adjustments may occur with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog that could reduce the dollar amount of our backlog and the revenues and profits that we actually earn. We cannot guarantee that future revenues projected by us based on our backlog at January 31, 2015 and subsequently awarded projects will be realized or will result in profitable operating results.\n- 12 -\nShould execution of these projects be interrupted, our future results of operations, including revenues, income from operations and net cash flows from operations, will be adversely affected, beginning in fiscal year 2016.\nUnsuccessful efforts to develop energy plant projects could result in write-offs and the loss of future business.\nIt is not uncommon in our industry that general construction contractors execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through joint ventures, limited partnerships and limited liability companies for the purpose of executing a project or program for a client, such as a government agency or a commercial enterprise. Such entities are generally dissolved upon completion of the corresponding project or program. Under an agreement negotiated with Moxie during the year ended January 31, 2012 and amended in May 2012, we supported the development of two power plant projects with loans that totaled approximately $8.9 million and that covered the costs of the project developments. In return, each Moxie project entity negotiated an EPC contract with GPS for the design and construction of one of the power plants. During the year ended January 31, 2014, Moxie was successful in selling its ownership interests in the project entities to Panda which resulted in the payment of development success fees to us and the commencement of the construction of the corresponding power plants by separate joint ventures formed by us for the purposes of completing the projects. The corresponding EPC contracts had an initial combined value of approximately $767 million. Approximately 94% of our contract backlog as of January 31, 2015 related to these two projects.\nDuring the year ended January 31, 2015, Moxie formed Moxie Freedom for the purpose of developing a natural gas-fired power plant project in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. We signed a development loan agreement with Moxie Freedom with a commitment to lend up to $6 million in funding; we received the right to receive the corresponding EPC contract and a success fee upon the successful completion of the development effort by Moxie. As of January 31, 2015, Moxie Freedom had incurred approximately $2,658,000 in capitalized construction project development costs that were included in our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2015.\nThere are no assurances that we will benefit from successful future development efforts, including Moxie Freedom\u2019s project to develop a power plant. Failure to complete the development of power plants in the future would result in the loss of future potential construction business and could result in write-off adjustments related to the balance of any project development costs. Such an adjustment could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for a future reporting period.\nFuture construction projects may depend on the continuing acceptability of the hydraulic fracturing process in certain states.\nThe viability of the two current construction projects described above was based substantially on the availability of inexpensive natural gas supplies provided through the use of hydraulic fracturing drilling techniques. Certain technological advancements in recent years have led to the widespread use of hydraulic fracturing (\u201cfracking\u201d) and horizontal drilling techniques in order to reach natural gas and oil deposits previously trapped within shale rock formations deep under the earth\u2019s surface. The new supplies have transformed the oil and gas industry in the United States. In particular, the new supplies of natural gas have depressed the price of natural gas in the United States, making the operation of natural gas-fired power plants more economically appealing. However, the process of fracking uses large volumes of highly pressurized water to break-up the shale rock formations and to free the trapped natural gas and oil. This process is controversial due to concerns about the disposal of the waste water, the possible contamination of nearby water supplies and potential seismic events. As a result, not all states permit the use of fracking. Should future evidence confirm the concerns, or should a major contamination episode occur in the future, the use of fracking may be suspended, limited, or curtailed by state and/or federal regulation. As a result, the supply of inexpensive natural gas may not be available in the future and the economic viability of gas-fired power plants may be jeopardized. A reduction in the pace of the construction of new gas-fired power plants would have a significantly adverse effect on our future operating results.\nInterruption of power plant construction projects could adversely affect future results of operations.\nAt any time, GPS has a limited number of construction contracts. Two projects represented approximately 94% of the value of our construction contract backlog at January 31, 2015. Should any unexpected suspension, termination or delay of the work under such contracts occur, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\n- 13 -\nThe nature of our engineering and construction business exposes us to potential liability claims and contract disputes which may reduce our profits.\nWe engage in engineering and construction activities for large and complex energy plant facilities where design, construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to third parties. In addition, the nature of our business results in owners, subcontractors and vendors occasionally presenting claims against us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur, or for which they believe they are not contractually liable. We have been, and may be in the future, named as a defendant in legal proceedings where parties may make a claim for damages or other remedies with respect to our projects or other matters. These claims generally arise in the normal course of our business.\nIn accordance with customary industry practices, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses in order to protect against the risks we face. When it is determined that we have liability, we may not be covered by insurance or, if covered, the dollar amount of any liability may exceed our policy limits. Further, we may elect not to carry insurance if our management believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, we cannot insure fully against pollution and environmental risks. Our management liability insurance policies are on a \u201cclaims-made\u201d basis covering only claims actually made during the policy period currently in effect. In addition, even where insurance is maintained for such exposures, the policies have deductibles resulting in our assuming exposure for a layer of coverage with respect to any such claims. Any liability not covered by our insurance, in excess of our insurance limits or, if covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible, could result in a significant loss for us, which claims may reduce our future profits and cash available for operations.\nIn the future, we may bring claims against project owners for additional costs exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price. These types of claims occur due to matters such as owner-caused delays or changes from the initial project scope, both of which may result in additional cost. Often, these claims can be the subject of lengthy arbitration or litigation proceedings, and it is difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be fully resolved. When these types of events occur and unresolved claims are pending, we have used working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims. A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a negative impact on our liquidity and profitability.\nOur dependence upon third parties to complete many of our contracts may adversely affect our performance under future energy plant construction contracts.\nSome of the work performed under our energy plant construction contracts is actually performed by third-party subcontractors we hire. We also rely on third-party equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment included in an energy project and most of the materials (such as copper, concrete and steel) used in our construction projects. If we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers, our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired.\nIf the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated, especially when we are operating under a lump sum or a fixed-price type construction contract, we may suffer losses on these contracts. If a supplier, manufacturer or subcontractor fails to provide supplies, equipment or services as required under a negotiated contract for any reason, we may be required to source these supplies, equipment or services on a delayed basis or at a higher price than anticipated which could impact contract profitability in an adverse manner. In addition, if a subcontractor fails to pay its subcontractors, suppliers or employees, liens may be placed on our project requiring us to incur the costs of reimbursing such parties in order to have the liens removed.\nIf we guarantee the timely completion or performance standards of a project, we could incur additional costs to cover our guarantee obligations.\nIn some instances and in many of our fixed price contracts, we guarantee a customer that we will complete a project by a scheduled date. We sometimes provide that the project, when completed, will also achieve certain performance standards. If we subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled, or if the project subsequently fails to meet guaranteed performance standards, we may be held responsible for cost impacts to the customer resulting from any delay or modifications to the plant in order to achieve the performance standards, generally in the form of contractually agreed-upon liquidated damages. If these events would occur, the total costs of the project would exceed our original estimate, and we could experience reduced profits or a loss for that project.\n- 14 -\nIf financing for new energy plants is unavailable, construction of such plants may not occur and we may lose any investment made in the projects.\nHistorically, natural gas-fired power plants have been constructed typically by large utility companies. However, to a large extent, the construction of new energy plants, including alternative and renewable energy facilities, is conducted by private investment groups. This type of project owner may be challenged in obtaining financing necessary to complete the project. Should debt financing for the construction of new energy facilities, including alternative or renewable energy plants, not be available, equity investors may not be able to invest in such projects, thereby adversely affecting the likelihood that GPS will obtain contracts to construct such plants.\nWe continue to see new business opportunities that contemplate our making an investment in the ownership of a new project, at least during the development phase of the project, in order to improve the probability of an EPC contract award. Because we believe in the strength of our balance sheet, we are willing to consider the opportunities that include reasonable and manageable risks. Failure of a project owner to obtain such financing will make it likely that we will not recover the amount of any investment made by us in the project.\nThe inability of our customers to receive or to avoid delay in receiving the applicable regulatory approvals relating to projects may result in lost or postponed revenues for us.\nThe commencement and/or execution of many of the construction projects performed by our power industry services segment are subject to numerous regulatory permitting processes. Applications for permits may be opposed by individuals or environmental groups, resulting in delays and possible denial of the permits. There are no assurances that our project-owner customers will obtain the necessary permits for these projects, or that the necessary permits will be obtained in order to allow construction work to proceed as scheduled. Failure to commence or complete construction work as anticipated could have material adverse impacts on our future revenues, profits and cash flows from operations.\nOur use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting could result in a reduction or reversal of previously recorded revenues or profits.\nUnder our accounting procedures, we measure and recognize a large portion of our revenues under the percentage-of-completion accounting methodology. This methodology allows us to recognize revenues and contract profits ratably over the life of a contract by comparing the amount of the costs incurred to date against the total amount of costs expected to be incurred. The effects of revisions to revenues and estimated costs are recorded when the amounts are known and can be reasonably estimated, and these revisions can occur at any time and could be material. Given the uncertainties associated with these types of contracts, it is possible for actual costs to vary from estimates previously made, which may result in reductions or reversals of previously recorded revenues and profits.\nFuture bonding requirements may adversely affect our ability to compete for new energy plant construction projects.\nOur construction contracts frequently require that we obtain payment and performance bonds from surety companies on behalf of project owners as a condition to the award of such contracts. Historically, we have had a strong bonding capacity but, under standard terms in the surety market, surety companies issue bonds on a project-by-project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of additional collateral as a condition to issuing any bonds.\nCurrent or future market conditions, changes in our performance or financial position, changes in our surety\u2019s assessment of its own operating and financial risk or larger future projects could cause our surety company to decline to issue, or substantially reduce the amount of, bonds for our work and could increase our bonding costs. These actions can be taken on short notice. If our surety company were to limit or eliminate our access to bonding, our alternatives would include seeking bonding capacity from other surety companies, joint venturing with other construction firms, increasing business with clients that do not require bonds and posting other forms of collateral for project performance, such as letters of credit, or cash. We may be unable to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. Accordingly, if we were to experience an interruption, reduction or other alteration in the availability of bonding capacity, we may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects.\n- 15 -\nAs we bear the risk of cost overruns in the completion of our construction contracts, we may experience reduced profits or, in some cases, losses under these contracts if actual costs exceed our estimates.\nWe conduct our business under various types of contractual arrangements including fixed price contracts. We bear a significant portion of the risk for cost overruns on these types of contracts where contract prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates. Our estimates may be based on a number of assumptions about future economic conditions and the future prices and availability of labor, equipment and materials, and other exigencies. From time to time, we may also assume a project\u2019s technical risk, which means that we may have to satisfy certain technical requirements of a project despite the fact that at the time of project award, we may not have previously produced the system or product in question. Unexpected or increased costs may occur due to the following factors among others:\n\u2022\nshortages of skilled labor, materials and energy plant equipment including power turbines;\n\u2022\nunanticipated escalation in the price of construction commodities;\n\u2022\nunscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment;\n\u2022\nengineering problems, including those relating to the commissioning of newly designed equipment;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages and other declines in the productivity of construction workers;\n\u2022\nweather interference;\n\u2022\ninability to develop or non-acceptance of new technologies to produce alternative fuel sources; and\n\u2022\nthe difficulty in obtaining necessary permits or approvals.\nIf our estimates prove inaccurate, or circumstances change, cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits, or in some cases, incur a loss on a particular project.\nIf we are unable to collect amounts billed to project owners as scheduled, our cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.\nMany of our contracts require us to satisfy specified design, engineering, procurement or construction milestones in order to receive payment for work completed or equipment or supplies procured prior to achievement of the applicable contract milestone. As a result, under these types of arrangements, we may incur significant costs or perform significant amounts of services prior to receipt of payment. If the customer determines not to proceed with the completion of the project, delays in making payment of billed amounts or defaults on its payment obligations, we may face delays or other difficulties in collecting payment of amounts due to us for the costs previously incurred or for the amounts previously expended to purchase equipment or supplies. Such problems may impact the planned cash flows of affected projects and result in unanticipated reductions in the amounts of future cash flows from operations.\nIf the future shutdown of existing coal-fired power plants does not occur, the demand for our construction services could decline.\nAlthough certain coal-fired power plants have been shut down and the demand for coal as a power source has been adversely affected by the inexpensive supply of natural gas in the United States, existing coal plants are proving to be a challenge to retrofit or replace. Coal prices are widely considered to be stable and certain states see the availability of inexpensive, coal-fired electricity as a key driver of economic growth. However, new regulations regarding air pollution are being promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) including the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) and the EPA\u2019s looming global warming rules included in its Clean Power Plan. MATS requires large coal-fired electricity generators to meet stricter emission standards by incorporating emission control technologies in existing power facilities. Some power plant operators have decided that retrofitting units to meet the new standards is cost-prohibitive and are choosing to retire older coal-fired units instead. Implementation during 2015 of the pending Clean Power Plan in its current state would likely reduce coal-fired power generation in favor of new natural gas-fired power plants and renewable energy facilities.\nThe full extent to which regulations issued by the EPA, that are intended to make smokestack emissions cleaner, will accelerate the pace of coal-fired power plant retirements or eliminate coal-fired power plants unplanned is not yet known. Should the federal government\u2019s anti-pollution regulations be overturned or modified by the courts, repealed by the Congress or otherwise weakened or eliminated, the pace of the development of natural gas-fired power plants may slow, thereby reducing the future opportunities for GPS to construct such plants.\n- 16 -\nWe could be subject to compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that would add costs to our business.\nOur operations are subject to compliance with federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those relating to discharges to air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances. Certain environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance and others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, impose strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability upon persons responsible for releases of hazardous substances. We continually evaluate whether we must take additional steps to ensure compliance with environmental laws, however, there can be no assurance that these requirements will not change and that compliance will not adversely affect our operations in the future.\nLoss of the Domestic Production Activities Deduction (\u201cDPAD\u201d) could increase our effective income tax rate.\nUnder the current Internal Revenue Code, a corporation is allowed a DPAD equal to the specified percentage for the tax year of the corporation\u2019s qualified production activities income for the tax year, subject to certain limits. For the years ended January 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the favorable income tax effects of permanent differences included significant amounts relating to the DPAD. Speculations about future income tax reform often cite the need for a reduction of the current federal tax rate of 35%. Should any future reduction of the corporate income tax rate be offset by reductions or even the eliminations of certain corporate tax expenditures like the deferral of the active income of controlled foreign corporations or the DPAD, the net change could result in an increase to our overall effective federal income tax rate with a corresponding reductions in our future net income amounts.\nOur acquisition strategy may result in dilution to our stockholders.\nOur business strategy calls for the strategic acquisition of other businesses. We anticipate that future acquisitions will require cash and issuances of our capital stock, including our common stock. To the extent we are required to pay cash for any acquisition, we anticipate that we would be required to obtain additional equity and/or debt financing. Equity financing would result in dilution for our then current stockholders. Stock issuances and financing, if obtained, may not be on terms favorable to us and could result in substantial dilution to our stockholders at the time(s) of these stock issuances and financings.\nOur officers, directors and certain unaffiliated stockholders have substantial control over the Company\nAs of January 31, 2015, our executive officers and directors as a group owned approximately 10.4% of our voting shares giving effect to an aggregate of 352,000 shares of common stock that may be purchased upon the exercise of stock options held by our executive officers and directors (and deemed exercisable at January 31, 2015), and 704,993 shares beneficially owned by William F. Griffin, Jr. (a founder and the current chief executive officer of GPS and member of our Board of Directors). An additional 3.63% of the outstanding shares are controlled by Allen & Company entities (\u201cAllen\u201d). One of our independent directors is an officer of Allen. In addition, three (3) other stockholders owned approximately 17.99% of our voting shares in total. The approximate individual beneficial ownership percentages for these three stockholders as of January 31, 2015 were 6.60%, 5.81% and 5.58%, respectively.\nThese small groups of stockholders may have significant influence over corporate actions such as an amendment to our certificate of incorporation, the consummation of any merger, or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and may substantially influence the election of directors and other actions requiring stockholder approval.\nWe may not pay cash dividends in the future.\nAnnually, our board of directors evaluates the Company\u2019s ongoing operational and financial performance in order to determine what role strategically aligned dividends should play in creating shareholder value. Due primarily to the continued strong performance of GPS and the associated cash flows, we paid special cash dividends during the calendar years 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011 in the amounts of $0.70, $0.75, $0.60 and $0.50 per share, respectively. Under our financing arrangements with the Bank, we are required to obtain the Bank\u2019s consent to the payment of cash dividends. We have obtained consents related to the special cash dividends paid for the last four years. There can be no assurance that the evaluations of our board of directors will result in the payment of cash dividends in the future, or that we will be successful in obtaining the required consent of the Bank to pay such cash dividends.\n- 17 -\nAs our common stock is thinly traded, the stock price may be volatile and investors may have difficulty disposing of their investments at prevailing market prices.\nOur common stock is listed for trading on the NYSE stock exchange and trades under the symbol AGX. Despite the listing on this national stock exchange, our common stock remains thinly and sporadically traded and no assurances can be given that a larger market will ever develop, or if developed, that it will be maintained.\nWe may issue preferred stock with rights that are superior to our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation, as amended, permits our board of directors to authorize the issuance of up to 500,000 shares of preferred stock and to designate the terms of the preferred stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock by us could adversely affect the rights of holders of common stock by, among other factors, establishing dividend rights, liquidation rights and voting rights that are superior to the rights of the holders of the common stock.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and Delaware law could deter takeover attempts.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and Delaware law could delay, prevent, or make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us. Among other things, as stated above, our board of directors may issue up to 500,000 shares of our preferred stock and may determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting and conversion rights, of these shares of preferred stock. In addition, Delaware law limits transactions between us and persons that acquire significant amounts of our stock without approval of our board of directors.", "PERMNO": 64785, "SIC": 8711, "TIC": "AGX"}
