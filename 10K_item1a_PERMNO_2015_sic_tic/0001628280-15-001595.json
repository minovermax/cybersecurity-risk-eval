{"cik": "1463258", "company": "Renewable Energy Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-06", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRisk Factors\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, and as a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisk Associated With Our Business\nLoss or reductions of governmental requirements for the use of biofuels could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating margins.\nThe biomass-based diesel industry relies substantially on federal requirements and state policies for use of biofuels. Since biomass-based diesel has been more expensive to produce than petroleum-based diesel fuel over the past few years, the biomass-based diesel industry depends on governmental programs that support a market for biomass-based diesel that might not otherwise exist.\nThe most important of these government programs in the United States is RFS2, which requires that a certain volume of biomass-based diesel fuel, which includes biodiesel and renewable hydrocarbon diesel, be consumed. RFS2 became effective on July 1, 2010 and applies through 2022. We believe that much of the increase in demand for our biomass-based diesel since July 2010 is attributable to and accelerated by the implementation of RFS2. In addition, we believe that biomass-based diesel prices since July 2010 benefited significantly from RFS2.\nThe EPA is required to determine the volume of biomass-based diesel that will be required each year based on the EPA\u2019s consideration of a variety of factors, with a minimum biomass-based diesel annual volume requirement be at least 1 billion gallons . The biomass-based diesel volume requirement for 2013 was 1.28 billion gallons.\nThere can be no assurance that the United States Congress will not repeal, curtail or otherwise change, or that the EPA will not curtail or otherwise change the RFS2 program in a manner adverse to us. The petroleum industry is generally opposed to RFS2 and can be expected to continue to press for changes that eliminate or reduce its impact. Any repeal or reduction in the RFS2 requirements or reinterpretation of RFS2 resulting in our biomass-based diesel failing to qualify as a required fuel would materially decrease the demand for and price of our biomass-based diesel, which would materially and adversely harm our revenues and cash flows.\nIf Congress decides to repeal or curtail RFS2, or if the EPA is not able or willing to enforce RFS2 requirements, the demand for our biomass-based diesel based on this program and any increases in demand that we expect due to RFS2 would be significantly reduced or eliminated and our revenues and operating margins would be materially harmed. In addition, although we believe that state requirements for the use of biofuels increase demand for our biomass-based diesel within such states, they generally may not increase overall demand in excess of RFS2 requirements. Rather, existing demand for our biofuel from petroleum refiners and petroleum fuel importers in the 48 contiguous states or Hawaii, which are defined as \u201cObligated Parties\u201d in the RFS2 regulations, in connection with federal requirements, may shift to states that have use requirements or tax incentive programs.\nAs of the date of this filing, the EPA has not finalized the 2014 or 2015 Renewable Volume Obligations, or RVOs. The EPA originally proposed a 2014 and 2015 biomass-based diesel RVO of 1.28 billion gallons in each of those years and a reduced Advanced Biofuel RVO of 2.0 to 2.51 billion gallons rather than the original Energy Independence and Security Act of 2009, or EISA, volume of 3.75 billion gallons for 2014. The EPA received significant negative feedback to their proposal number and subsequently issued a \"notification in delay in issuing standards.\" Before the RVO can be finalized, the OMB has to approve EPA\u2019s proposal, based on the same factors outlined above. Due to the delay in publishing the proposal, which the EPA was required to determine and publish by November 30 two years prior, it is possible that the 2014 and 2015 RVOs will be\nchallenged in court which may further delay any final determination of such RVOs, which could reduce the demand for and price of our biomass-based diesel and could harm our revenues and cash flows.\nOur financial results may be harmed in the event biodiesel production exceeds the RVO.\nNotwithstanding the lack of a finalized 2014 RVO, according to EMTS data, RINs representing 1.75 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel were generated for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. According to EMTS data, 1.78 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel was produced and imported into the U.S. in 2013. Adding the 2012 carry-over to the 2013 RIN generation results in an estimated total biomass-based diesel RIN availability of approximately 2.04 billion gallons, which is approximately 760 million gallons more than required to satisfy the 1.28 billion gallon 2013 biomass-based diesel RVO. The originally proposed 2014 biomass-based diesel RVO of 1.28 billion gallons, would have limited the 2014 carryover to 256 million gallons, or 20%, of 1.28 billion, thus resulting in an excess supply of 504 million gallons of biomass-based diesel RINs. Excess biomass-based diesel RINs may be used to fulfill the advanced biofuel RVO or the renewable fuel RVO. If the volume of excess biomass-based diesel RINs exceeds the volume the Obligated Parties desire to use to fulfill their advanced biofuel and renewable fuel requirements, the demand for and price of our biomass-based and biomass-based diesel RINs may be reduced, which could harm revenues and cash flows.\nOur gross margins are dependent on the spread between biomass-based diesel prices and feedstock costs.\nOur gross margins depend on the spread between biomass-based diesel prices and feedstock costs. Historically, the spread between biomass-based diesel prices and feedstock costs has varied significantly. Although actual yields vary depending on the feedstock quality, the average monthly spread between the price per gallon of 100% pure biodiesel, or B100, as reported by The Jacobsen Publishing Company, or The Jacobsen, and the price per gallon for the amount of choice white grease, a common inedible animal fat used by us to make biomass-based diesel, was $1.26 in 2012, $1.61 in 2013 and $0.92 in 2014 assuming 8.0 pounds of choice white grease yields one gallon of biomass-based. The average monthly spread for the amount of crude soybean oil required to produce one gallon of biomass-based, based on the nearby futures contract as reported on the Chicago Board of Trade, or CBOT, was $0.65 in 2012, $1.19 in 2013 and $0.58 in 2014 assuming 7.7 pounds of soybean oil yields one gallon of biomass-based. For 2012, 2013 and 2014, approximately 84%, 83% and 85%, respectively, of our total feedstock usage was inedible corn oil, used cooking oil or inedible animal fat and 16%, 17% and 15%, respectively, was virgin vegetable oils.\nBiomass-based diesel has traditionally been marketed primarily as an additive or alternative to petroleum-based diesel fuel and as a result biomass-based diesel prices have been influenced by the price of petroleum-based diesel fuel, adjusted for government incentives supporting renewable fuels, rather than biomass-based diesel production costs. Energy prices, particular the market price for crude oil, significantly decreased throughout fourth quarter 2014. A lack of close correlation between production costs and biomass-based diesel prices means that we may be unable to pass increased production costs on to our customers in the form of higher prices. Any decrease in the spread between biomass-based diesel prices and feedstock costs, whether as a result of an increase in feedstock prices or a reduction in biomass-based diesel prices, including, but not limited to, a reduction in the value of RINs would adversely affect our gross margins, cash flow and results of operations.\nThe costs of raw materials that we use as feedstocks are volatile and our results of operations could fluctuate substantially as a result.\nThe cost of feedstocks is a significant uncertainty for our business. The success of our operations is dependent on the price of feedstocks and certain other raw materials that we use to produce biomass-based diesel. A decrease in the availability or an increase in the price of feedstocks may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. At elevated price levels, these feedstocks may be uneconomical to use, as we may be unable to pass feedstock cost increases on to our customers.\nThe price and availability of feedstocks and other raw materials may be influenced by general economic, market and regulatory factors. These factors include weather conditions, farming decisions, government policies and subsidies with respect to agriculture and international trade and global supply and demand. The significance and relative impact of these factors on the price of feedstocks is difficult to predict, especially without knowing what types of feedstock materials will be optimal for use in the future, particularly at new facilities that we may construct or acquire.\nThe price of our feedstocks can vary significantly based on market conditions. Since January 1, 2008, the cost per pound of choice white grease, an inedible animal fat commonly used by us in the production of biomass-based diesel, has traded in a range of $0.0950 to $0.5250 based on the closing nearby futures prices on the CBOT. If biomass-based diesel production continues to increase in response to RFS2, we expect that more biomass-based diesel producers will seek to use lower cost feedstocks, potentially increasing our costs of production. In addition, because the market for animal fat is less developed than markets for vegetable oils such as soybean oil, we generally are unable to enter into forward contracts at fixed prices.\nInedible corn oil and used cooking oil are not generally available in quantities sufficient to cover all of our operations. If more ethanol plants do not acquire and utilize corn oil extraction equipment, if extraction yields do not improve, if ethanol plants are idled, or ethanol plants begin using the feedstock in their own operations, we may not be able to obtain the volumes of inedible corn oil we desire for use in our production of biomass-based diesel at economical prices and may be forced to utilize higher cost feedstocks to meet increased demand, which may not be economical.\nLoss of or reductions in tax incentives for biomass-based diesel production or consumption may have a material adverse effect on industry revenues and operating margins.\nThe biomass-based diesel industry has historically been substantially aided by federal and state tax incentives. Prior to RFS2, the biomass-based diesel industry relied principally on these tax incentives to bring the price of biomass-based diesel more in line with the price of petroleum-based diesel fuel to the end user. The most significant tax incentive program has been the federal biodiesel mixture excise tax credit, or BTC. The BTC provided a $1.00 refundable tax credit per gallon of pure biomass-based, or B100, to the first blender of biomass-based with petroleum-based diesel fuel. The BTC came into existence on January 1, 2005, had been continuously reinstated until it expired on December 31, 2009 and was reinstated following the lapse in December 2010, retroactively for all of 2010 and prospectively for 2011. The BTC expired again on December 31, 2011 and was again reinstated on January 2, 2013, retroactively for all of 2012 and prospectively for 2013, expired again December 31, 2013 and was again reinstated on December 19, 2014. Unlike prior reinstatement, this last reinstatement was only for one year, retroactive for 2014, rather than two years as has previously been the case. It is generally understood that Congress decided to only enact a one year extenders package, which included the BTC, because Congress wanted to take up tax reform in 2015. There is no assurance that the BTC will be reinstated. Unlike RFS2, the BTC has a direct effect on federal government spending and could be changed or eliminated as a result of changes in the federal budget policy. It is uncertain what action, if any, Congress may take with respect to reinstating the BTC or when such action might be effective. If Congress does not reinstate the credit, demand for our biomass-based diesel and the price we are able to charge for our product may be significantly reduced, harming revenues and profitability. When the BTC expired on December 31, 2011, we experienced an industry-wide acceleration of gallons sold in the fourth quarter of 2011, which was further influenced by the ability of Obligated Parties to satisfy up to 20% of their current RVO with prior year RINs. We believe this increase in production at the end of the year resulted in a buildup of biomass-based diesel inventories and reduced gallons sold in the first quarter of 2012. With the expiration of the BTC at the end of 2013 and 2014, the industry experienced a similar increase in biomass-based diesel production in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 2014, which we believe reduced demand in the first quarter of 2014 and is reducing demand on the first quarter of 2015. In response to the regular lapsing and reinstatement of the BTC, the biomass-based diesel industry and its customers have adopted arrangements for sharing the BTC if reinstated.\nIn addition, several states have enacted tax incentives for the use of biodiesel and/or biomass-based diesel. For example, Illinois offers an exemption from the generally applicable 6.25% sales tax for biodiesel blends that incentivizes blending at 11% biodiesel, or B11. Like the BTC, the Illinois tax incentive program and the tax incentive programs of other state could be changed as a result of state budget considerations or otherwise. Reduction or elimination of such incentives could materially and adversely harm our revenues and profitability.\nRisk management transactions could significantly increase our operating costs and working capital requirements and may not be effective.\nIn an attempt to partially offset the effects of volatile feedstock costs and biomass-based diesel fuel prices, we may enter into contracts that establish market positions in feedstocks, such as inedible corn oil, used cooking oil, inedible animal fats and soybean oil, and related commodities, such as heating oil and ultra-low sulfur diesel, or ULSD. The financial impact of such market positions depends on commodity prices at the time that we are required to perform our obligations under these contracts. Risk management arrangements also expose us to the risk of financial loss in situations where the counterparty defaults on its contract or, in the case of exchange-traded or over-the-counter futures or options contracts, where there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the contract and the actual prices paid or received by us. Risk management activities can themselves result in losses when a position is purchased in a declining market or a position is sold in a rising market. Changes in the value of these futures instruments are recognized in current income and may result in margin calls. We may also vary the amount of risk management strategies we undertake, or we may choose not to engage in risk management transactions at all. Our results of operation may be negatively impacted if we are not able to manage our risk management strategy effectively.\nOne customer accounted for a meaningful percentage of revenues and a loss of this customer could have an adverse impact on our total revenues.\nOne customer, Pilot Travel Centers LLC, or Pilot, accounted for 18%, 16% and 36% of our revenues in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our revenues from Pilot generally do not include the RINs associated with the gallons of biomass-based sold to Pilot. The value of those RINs represented approximately an additional 7% of our total sales, based on the OPIS average RIN price for 2014. In the event we lose Pilot as a customer or Pilot significantly reduces the volume of biomass-based\ndiesel bought from us, it could be difficult to replace the lost revenues from biomass-based diesel and RINs, and our profitability and cash flow could be materially harmed.\nOur business is primarily dependent upon two similar products. As a consequence, we may not be able to adapt to changing market conditions or endure any decline in the biomass-based diesel industry.\nOur revenues are currently generated almost entirely from the production and sale of biodiesel and renewable hydrocarbon diesel, collectively referred to as biomass-based diesel. Our reliance on biomass-based diesel means that we may not be able to adapt to changing market conditions or to withstand any significant decline in the size or profitability of the biomass-based diesel industry. For example, in 2009 and the beginning of 2010, we were required to periodically idle our plants due to insufficient demand at profitable price points which materially affected our revenues. If we are required to idle our plants in the future or are unable to adapt to changing market conditions, our revenues and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nTechnological advances and changes in production methods in the biomass-based diesel industry could render our plants obsolete and adversely affect our ability to compete.\nIt is expected that technological advances in biomass-based diesel production methods will continue to occur and new technologies for biomass-based diesel production may develop. Advances in the process of converting oils and fats into biodiesel and renewable hydrocarbon diesel could allow our competitors to produce biomass-based diesel faster and more efficiently and at a substantially lower cost. If we are unable to adapt or incorporate technological advances into our operations, our production facilities could become less competitive or obsolete. Further, it may be necessary for us to make significant expenditures to acquire any new technology and retrofit our plants in order to incorporate new technologies and remain competitive. There is no assurance that third-party licenses for any proprietary technologies that we would need access to in order to remain competitive for either existing processes or new technology will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or that any new technologies could be incorporated into our plants. In order to execute our strategy to expand into the production of renewable chemicals, additional advanced biofuels, next generation feedstocks and related renewable products, we may need to acquire licenses or other rights to technology from third parties. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms. If we are unable to obtain, implement or finance new technologies, our production facilities could be less efficient than our competitors, we may not be able to successfully execute our strategy and our results of operations could be substantially harmed.\nOur intellectual property is integral to our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or others assert that our operations violate their intellectual property, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets in the United States and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is advantageous and cost-justified. Our ability to use and prevent others from using our intellectual property is important to our success. Effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in some countries. Some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application.\nIf we pursue litigation to assert our intellectual property rights, an adverse judicial decision in any of these legal actions could limit our ability to assert our intellectual property rights, limit our ability to develop new products, limit the value of our technology or otherwise negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny intellectual property rights claim against us, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, expensive to litigate or settle, divert management resources and attention and force us to acquire intellectual property rights and licenses, which may involve substantial royalty payments. Further, a party making such a claim, if successful, could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages. Any of these events could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to respond to changes in ASTM or customer standards, our ability to sell biomass-based may be harmed.\nWe currently produce biomass-based diesel to conform to or exceed standards established by ASTM. ASTM standards for biomass-based diesel and biomass-based diesel blends may be modified in response to new observations from the industries involved with diesel fuel. New tests or more stringent standards may require us to make additional capital investments in, or modify, plant operations to meet these standards. In addition, some biomass-based customers have developed their own biomass-based standards which are stricter than the ASTM standards. If we are unable to meet new ASTM standards or our biomass-based customers\u2019 standards cost effectively or at all, our production technology may become obsolete, and our ability to sell biomass-based may be harmed, negatively impacting our revenues and profitability.\nIncreases in our transportation costs or disruptions in our transportation services could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business depends on transportation services to deliver our products to our customers and to deliver raw materials to us. The costs of these transportation services are affected by the volatility in fuel prices, such as those caused by recent geopolitical and economic events. For example, in 2012, the market rates of leasing new rail cars nearly doubled as a result of increased demand to move domestically drilled crude oil from new supply fields in the upper Midwest to various refineries. We have not been able in the past, and may not be able in the future, to pass along part or all of any of these increases to customers. If we continue to be unable to increase our prices as a result of increased fuel costs charged to us by transportation providers, our gross margins may be materially adversely affected.\nIf any transportation providers fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner, we may be unable to manufacture products on a timely basis. Shipments of products and raw materials may be delayed due to weather conditions, strikes or other events. Any failure of a third-party transportation provider to deliver raw materials or products in a timely manner could harm our reputation, negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon our key management personnel and critical talent whereby the loss of any of these persons could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are highly dependent upon key members of our management team along with critical talent possessing unique technical skills for the execution of our business plan. We believe that our future success is highly dependent on the contributions of these key employees. There can be no assurance that any individual will continue in his or her capacity for any particular period of time. The loss of any of these key employees could delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial position.\nWe and certain subsidiaries have indebtedness, which subjects us to potential defaults, could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and limits our ability to react to changes in the economy or the biomass-based diesel industry.\nAt December 31, 2014, our total long-term debt was $252.9 million. This includes $121.4 million aggregate principal amount of 2.75% convertible senior notes due 2019 that we issued in June 2014, or the Convertible Notes, and $100.0 million of GOZone Bonds for which our newly acquired subsidiary, REG Geismar, is obligated. Our obligation with respect to the GOZone Bonds is secured by the deposit of $101.3 million with the financial institution whose letter of credit supports payments on the bonds. We also have short-term debt obligations under a revolving credit agreement provided by a bank group. At December 31, 2014, there was $16.7 million borrowings made under our revolving line of credit, all of which we guarantee. See \"Note 12 - Debt\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our indebtedness.\nOur indebtedness could:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments of principal, interest on, and other fees related to such indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital and capital expenditures, and for other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and biomass-based diesel industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the biomass-based diesel industry, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nlimit among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Convertible Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance the Convertible Notes, the GOZone Bonds, our other existing indebtedness or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our current or future indebtedness.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of our Convertible Notes in cash or to repurchase the Convertible Notes for cash upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to repurchase the Convertible Notes.\nHolders of the Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price generally equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required\nto make cash payments in respect of the Convertible Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the Convertible Notes upon a fundamental change or to settle conversion of the Convertible Notes in cash.\nIn addition, our ability to repurchase the Convertible Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Convertible Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture governing the Convertible Notes. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our other indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Convertible Notes.\nCertain provisions in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover or takeover attempt of us.\nCertain provisions in the Convertible Notes and the indenture could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, if a takeover would constitute a fundamental change, holders of the notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes in cash. In addition, if a takeover constitutes a make-whole fundamental change, we may be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their notes in connection with such takeover. In either case, and in other cases, our obligations under the notes and the indenture could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions.\nThe counterparties to the capped call transactions are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that they might default under the capped call transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. Recent global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If any option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings, with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with such option counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors, but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price and volatility of shares of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by any option counterparty, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.\nWe have generated no revenue from sales of renewable chemicals to date and we face significant challenges to developing this business.\nWe have only recently entered the market for renewable chemicals with our acquisition of LS9, Inc.'s assets in January 2014. To date, we have not generated any revenues from this business which is still at a pre-commercial stage. In order to generate revenue from our renewable chemicals, we must be able to produce sufficient quantities of our products, which we have not done to date.\nIn entering this market, we intend to sell renewable chemicals as an alternative to chemicals currently in use, and in some cases the chemicals that we seek to replace have been used for many years. The potential customers for our renewable chemical products generally have well developed manufacturing processes and arrangements with suppliers of the chemical components of their products and may resist changing these processes and components. These potential customers frequently impose lengthy and complex product qualification procedures on their suppliers. Factors that these potential customers consider during the product qualification process include consumer preference, manufacturing considerations such as process changes and capital and other costs associated with transitioning to alternative components, supplier operating history, regulatory issues, product liability and other factors, many of which are unknown to, or not well understood by, us. Satisfying these processes may take many months or years. If we are unable to convince these potential customers that our products are comparable to the chemicals that they currently use or that the use of our products produces benefits to them, we will not be successful in these markets and our business will be adversely affected. Additionally, in contrast to the tax incentives relating to biofuels, tax credits and subsidies are not currently available in the United States for consumer products or chemical companies who use renewable chemical products. We do not expect meaningful revenue from our sale of renewable chemicals in the near term.\nIf we fail to expand effectively in international markets, where we have limited operating history, our revenues and our business may be harmed.\nHistorically, we have generated nearly all of our revenues from the United States. In December 2014, we acquired a 69% interest in Petrotec, which owns two biorefineries in Germany. We have made a cash tender offer for the remaining Petrotec shares but there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire these shares. If we are unable to complete the tender offer, our ability to control the operations of Petrotec may be limited.\nWe have no experience operating a biorefinery outside of the United States. Our ability to recognize the benefit of our investment in Petrotec, or any other international operations we invest in, will require the attention of management and is subject to a number of risks. Specifically, the biodiesel market in Europe benefits from regulations that encourage the use of biodiesel. As is the case in the United States, these regulations are subject to political and public opinion and may be changed. In addition, expanding our operations internationally subjects us to the following risks:\n\u2022\nrecruiting and retaining talented and capable management and employees in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nchallenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences;\n\u2022\nprotecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees;\n\u2022\nthe inability to extend proprietary rights in our technology into new jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nforeign tax consequences;\n\u2022\nforeign exchange controls or U.S. tax restrictions that might restrict or prevent us from repatriating income earned in countries outside the United States;\n\u2022\npolitical, economic and social instability;\n\u2022\nhigher costs associated with doing business internationally; and\n\u2022\nexport or import regulations; and trade and tariff restrictions.\nThese factors and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenues. Our failure to successfully manage any international operations and the associated risks effectively could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe might require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop our renewable chemicals business or expand or enhance our biomass-based operations or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financing to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing could involve restrictive covenants, which may restrict our flexibility in operating our business and make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, and our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe may encounter difficulties in effectively integrating the businesses we acquire.\nWe may face significant challenges in effectively integrating entities and businesses that we acquire, including our acquisition of substantially all of LS9's assets in January 2014, as well as our acquisition of Syntroleum Corporation and Dynamic Fuels, LLC in June 2014, and our anticipated acquisition of the remaining ownership of Petrotec and we may not realize the benefits anticipated from such acquisitions. Achieving the anticipated benefits of our acquired businesses will depend in part upon whether we can integrate our businesses in an efficient and effective manner. Our integration of acquired businesses involves a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulty in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired company;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in effectively integrating the acquired technologies, products or services with our current technologies, products or services;\n\u2022\ndemands on management related to the increase in our size after the acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from daily operations to the integration of acquired businesses and personnel;\n\u2022\nfailure to achieve expected synergies and costs savings;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation of different cultures and practices, as well as in the assimilation of broad and geographically dispersed personnel and operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration of departments, systems, including accounting systems, technologies, books and records and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards and controls, including internal control over financial reporting, and related procedures and policies;\n\u2022\nincurring acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating results;\n\u2022\nthe need to fund significant working capital requirements of any acquired production facilities;\n\u2022\npotential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company or technology, including but not limited to, issues with the acquired company\u2019s intellectual property, product quality, environmental liabilities, data back-up and security, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, employee, customer or partner issues or legal and financial contingencies;\n\u2022\nexposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of, an acquisition, including but not limited to, claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties; and\n\u2022\nincurring significant exit charges if products or services acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful.\nWe may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions and other strategic relationships on favorable terms in order to execute our strategy to grow and diversify our business.\nWe regularly review domestic and international acquisitions of biofuel production facilities and have acquired most of our facilities from third parties. However, we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future. Even if we identify appropriate acquisition candidates, we may be unable to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to successfully acquire other businesses or facilities, we may not be able to grow our business as planned.\nWe may require additional capital to fund future acquisitions. If we are unable to obtain such capital on satisfactory terms, or if such capital is otherwise unavailable, we may be unable to complete such acquisitions and our business may be harmed.\nWe may not realize the benefit of our investment in the renewable chemicals market.\nWe have only recently expanded our business into the production of renewable chemicals from biomass feedstocks through the acquisition of certain assets. The renewable chemicals market is underdeveloped. Any chemicals that we produce from renewable sources may not prove to be as effective as chemicals produced from conventional sources and, regardless of their effectiveness, renewable chemicals may not be accepted in the chemical marketplace. If this were to occur, we would not realize the benefit of our investment in renewable chemicals and our results of operations could be harmed.\nWe have three partially constructed plants, one non-operational plant, and planned upgrades to our operating plants, each of which would require capital that we may not be able to raise and that may result in an impairment that could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations and future cash flows.\nWe have three partially constructed plants, one near New Orleans, Louisiana, one in Emporia, Kansas and one in Clovis, New Mexico and one non-operational plant near Atlanta, Georgia. We may choose to invest approximately $165 to $180 million in the aggregate, excluding working capital requirements, before these four plants would be able to commence production. Our Clovis plant is currently being operated as a terminal facility. In order to complete construction these facilities as planned, we will require additional capital. In November 2012, we acquired the above mentioned biomass-based facility near Atlanta, Georgia, which had been idled prior to our acquisition and will remain so until certain repairs or upgrades are made. While we intend to finance certain upgrades to our existing facilities from our cash flow from operations, we will need to raise significant capital to complete construction of the three partially constructed or non-operational facilities and to fund related working capital requirements. It is uncertain when or if financing will be available. It is also likely that the terms of any project financing would include customary financial and other covenants restricting our project subsidiaries, including restrictions on the ability to make distributions, to guarantee indebtedness and to incur liens on the plants of such subsidiaries.\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, which are likely to cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate.\nOur operating results are influenced by seasonal fluctuations in the price of and demand for biodiesel. Our sales tend to decrease during the winter season due to perceptions that biodiesel will not perform adequately in colder weather. Colder seasonal temperatures can cause the higher cloud point biodiesel we make from inedible animal fats to become cloudy and eventually gel at a higher temperature than petroleum-based diesel or lower cloud point biodiesel made from soybean, canola, used cooking oil or inedible corn oil. Such gelling can lead to plugged fuel filters and other fuel handling and performance problems for customers and suppliers. Reduced demand in the winter for our higher cloud point biodiesel may result in excess supply of such higher cloud point biodiesel and lower prices for such higher cloud point biodiesel. In addition, most of our production facilities are located in colder Midwestern states and our costs of shipping biodiesel to warmer climates generally increase in cold weather months.\nIn addition, our RINs also have an element of seasonality to them. Since only 20% of an Obligated Party\u2019s annual RVO can be satisfied by prior year RINs, most RINs must come from biofuel produced or imported during the RVO year. As a result, one would expect RIN prices to decrease as the calendar year progresses if the RIN market is oversupplied compared to that year\u2019s RVO and increase if it is undersupplied. For example, in 2012, which had a RVO for biomass-based diesel of one billion gallons, biomass-based diesel RIN prices, as reported by OPIS, began to decrease in September when biomass-based diesel\nRIN generation neared the equivalent of 900 million gallons, as reported by EMTS. Similarly, in September of 2013 when biomass-based diesel RIN generation reached approximately 960 million gallons compared to a 2013 RVO of 1.28 billion gallons, biomass-based diesel RIN prices, as reported by OPIS, began to decline. As a result of these seasonal fluctuations, comparisons of operating measures between consecutive quarters may not be as meaningful as comparisons between longer reporting periods.\nFailure to comply with governmental regulations, including EPA requirements relating to RFS2, could result in the imposition of penalties, fines, or restrictions on our operations and remedial liabilities.\nThe biomass-based diesel industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations related to the general population\u2019s health and safety and compliance and permitting obligations, including those related to the use, storage, handling, discharge, emission and disposal of municipal solid waste and other waste, pollutants or hazardous substances, discharges, air and other emissions, as well as land use and development. Existing laws also impose obligations to clean up contaminated properties or to pay for the cost of such remediation, often upon parties that did not actually cause the contamination. Compliance with these laws, regulations and obligations could require substantial capital expenditures. Failure to comply could result in the imposition of penalties, fines or restrictions on operations and remedial liabilities. These costs and liabilities could adversely affect our operations.\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business in general and on our results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. We are unable to predict the effect of additional environmental laws and regulations which may be adopted in the future, including whether any such laws or regulations would significantly increase our cost of doing business or affect our operations in any area.\nUnder certain environmental laws and regulations, we could be held strictly liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination, or if current or prior operations were conducted consistent with accepted standards of practice. Such liabilities can be significant and, if imposed, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition to the regulations mentioned above, we are subject to various laws and regulations related to RFS2, most significantly regulations related to the generation and dissemination of RINs. These regulations are highly complex and evolving, requiring us to periodically update our compliance systems. For example, in 2008, we unintentionally generated duplicate RINs as a result of a change to the software we use to manage RIN generation. We voluntarily reported this violation to the EPA and followed EPA guidance in correcting the issue promptly. In 2011, we entered into an administrative settlement agreement with the EPA regarding this violation and paid a fine for this inadvertent violation. Any violation of these regulations by us, inadvertently or otherwise, could result in significant fines and harm our customers\u2019 confidence in the RINs we issue, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. For a detailed description of RINs, see \u201cBusiness-Government Programs Favoring Biodiesel Production and Use-Renewable Identification Numbers.\u201d\nIn response to certain cases of RIN fraud whereby biomass-based producers were selling biomass-based diesel RINs without having produced the required renewable fuel, the EPA is in the process of implementing a quality assurance program for RIN compliance. Compliance with these or any new regulations or Obligated Party verification procedures could require significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance. Failure to comply could result in the imposition of penalties, fines, restrictions on operations, loss of customers and remedial liabilities. These costs and liabilities may have a material adverse effect on our business in general and on our results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. We are unable to predict the effect of any additional regulatory or customer requirements which may be adopted in the future, including whether any such regulations or verification procedures would significantly increase our cost of doing business or affect our operations in any area.\nOur business may suffer if we are unable to attract or retain talented personnel.\nOur success depends on the abilities, expertise, judgment, discretion, integrity and good faith of our management and employees to manage the business and respond to economic, market and other conditions. We have a relatively small management team and employee base, and the inability to attract suitably qualified replacements or additional staff could adversely affect our business. No assurance can be given that our management team or employee base will continue their employment, or that replacement personnel with comparable skills could be found. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and additional employees, our business may be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we might not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud. In that case, our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and could negatively impact the value of our stock.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. The process of maintaining our internal controls may be expensive and time consuming and may require significant attention from management. Although we have concluded as of December 31, 2014 that our internal control over financial reporting provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect fraud or misstatements. Failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover a material weakness, the disclosure of that fact could harm the value of our stock and our business.\nA natural disaster, leak, fire or explosion at any of our production plants or customer\u2019s facilities could increase our costs and liabilities.\nBecause biomass-based diesel and some of its inputs and outputs are combustible and/or flammable, a leak, fire or explosion may occur at a plant or customer\u2019s facility which could result in damage to the plant and nearby properties, injury to employees and others, and interruption of operations. A majority of our facilities are also located in the Midwest, which is subject to tornado activity. Furthermore, REG Life Sciences' research and development center is in South San Francisco, California, which is subject to earthquakes. In addition, our Houston and Geismar facilities, due to their Gulf Coast location, are vulnerable to hurricanes, which may cause plant damage, injury to employees and others and interruption of operations and all of our plants could incur damage from other natural disasters. If any of the foregoing events occur, we may incur significant additional costs including, among other things, loss of profits due to unplanned temporary or permanent shutdowns of our facilities, clean-up costs, liability for damages or injuries, legal expenses and reconstruction expenses, which would seriously harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur insurance may not protect us against our business and operating risks.\nWe maintain insurance for some, but not all, of the potential risks and liabilities associated with our business. For some risks, we may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and, in some instances, certain insurance policies may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. As a result, we may not be able to renew our existing insurance policies or procure other desirable insurance on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Although we intend to maintain insurance at levels we believe are appropriate for our business and consistent with industry practice, we will not be fully insured against all risks. In addition, pollution, environmental risks and the risk of natural disasters generally are not fully insurable. Losses and liabilities from uninsured and underinsured events and delay in the payment of insurance proceeds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosures of confidential information, trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nWe rely in part on trade secret protection to protect our confidential and proprietary information and processes. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We have taken measures to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information, but these measures may not be effective. For example, we require new employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment or consulting arrangement with us. These agreements generally require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual\u2019s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. These agreements also generally provide that knowhow and inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us are our exclusive property. Nevertheless, these agreements may be breached, or may not be enforceable, and our proprietary information may be disclosed. Further, despite the existence of these agreements, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques. Accordingly, it may be difficult for us to protect our trade secrets. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nMoreover, we cannot assure you that our technology does not infringe upon any valid claims of patents that other parties own. In the future, if we are found to be infringing on a patent owned by a third party, we might have to seek a license from such third party to use the patented technology. We cannot assure you that, if required, we would be able to obtain such a license on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If a third party brought a legal action against us or our licensors, we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves, and we cannot assure you that such an action would be resolved in our favor. If such a dispute were to be resolved against us, we could be subject to significant damages.\nWe are a holding company and there are limitations on our ability to receive dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries.\nAll of our principal assets, including our biomass-based diesel production facilities, are owned by subsidiaries and some of these subsidiaries are subject to loan covenants that generally restrict them from paying dividends, making distributions or making loans to us or to any other subsidiary. These limitations will restrict our ability to repay indebtedness, finance capital projects or pay dividends to stockholders from our subsidiaries\u2019 cash flows from operations.\nRisks Related to the Biomass-based diesel Industry\nThe market price of biomass-based diesel is influenced by the price of petroleum-based distillate fuels, such as ultra-low sulfur diesel, and decreases in the price of petroleum-based distillate fuels or RIN values would very likely decrease the price we can charge for our biomass-based diesel, which could harm our revenues and profitability.\nHistorically, biodiesel prices have been strongly correlated to petroleum-based diesel prices and in particular ULSD, regardless of the cost of producing biomass-based diesel itself. We market our biofuel as an alternative to petroleum-based fuels. Therefore, if the price of petroleum-based diesel falls, the price of biomass-based diesel could decline, and we may be unable to produce products that are an economically viable alternative to petroleum-based fuels. Petroleum prices are volatile due to global factors, such as the impact of wars, political uprisings, new extraction technologies and techniques, OPEC production quotas, worldwide economic conditions, changes in refining capacity and natural disasters. Additionally, demand for liquid transportation fuels, including biomass-based diesel, is impacted by economic conditions.\nJust as a small reduction in the real or anticipated supply of crude oil can have a significant upward impact on the price of petroleum-based fuels, a perceived reduction of such threats can result in a significant reduction in petroleum-based fuel prices. A reduction in petroleum-based fuel prices may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profits if such price decrease reduces the price we are able to charge for our biomass-based diesel.\nThere was a significant decline in RIN prices during the second and third quarters of 2014, but the price went back up in the fourth quarter and finished the year at its peak at $0.77 per RIN, as reported by OPIS. In 2013, RIN prices decreased sharply from $1.09 per RIN on July 1, 2013 to $0.35 per RIN at December 31, 2013. A reduction in RIN values, such as those experienced in 2013 and remaining low throughout the majority of 2014, may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profits as such price decrease reduce the price we are able to charge for our biomass-based diesel.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and competition in our industry would increase if new participants enter the biomass-based diesel business.\nWe operate in a very competitive environment. The biomass-based diesel industry is primarily comprised of smaller entities that engage exclusively in biodiesel production, large integrated agribusiness companies that produce biodiesel along with their soybean crush businesses and increasingly, integrated petroleum companies. We face competition for capital, labor, feedstocks and other resources from these companies. In the United States, we compete with soybean processors and refiners, including Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, Cargill, and Louis Dreyfus Commodities. In addition, petroleum refiners are increasingly entering into biomass-based diesel production, which includes Neste Oil with approximately 600 million gallons of global renewable hydrocarbon diesel production capacity in Asia and Europe and Valero Energy Corporation with its Diamond Green joint venture renewable hydrocarbon diesel plant. These and other competitors that are divisions of larger enterprises may have greater financial resources than we do. We also have many smaller competitors. If our competitors consolidate or otherwise grow and we are unable to similarly increase our scale, our business and prospects may be significantly and adversely affected.\nIn addition, petroleum companies and diesel retailers form the primary distribution networks for marketing biomass-based diesel through blended petroleum-based diesel. If these companies increase their direct or indirect biomass-based diesel production, there will be less need to purchase biomass-based diesel from independent biomass-based diesel producers like us. Such a shift in the market would materially harm our operations, cash flows and financial position.\nThe development of alternative fuels and energy sources may reduce the demand for biodiesel, resulting in a reduction in our revenues and profitability.\nThe development of alternative fuels, including a variety of energy alternatives to biodiesel has attracted significant attention and investment. Neste Oil operates four renewable hydrocarbon diesel plants: a 240 million gallon per year plant in Singapore, a 240 million gallon per year plant in Rotterdam, Netherlands, and two 60 million gallon per year plants in Porvoo, Finland. In the United States, Diamond Green Diesel, LLC operates a 137 million gallon per year renewable hydrocarbon diesel plant in Norco, Louisiana in 2013. Under RFS2, renewable hydrocarbon diesel made from biomass meets the definition of biomass-based diesel and thus is eligible, along with biodiesel, to satisfy the RFS2 biomass-based diesel requirement described in \u201cBusiness-Government Programs Favoring Biodiesel Production and Use.\u201d Furthermore, under RFS2, renewable hydrocarbon diesel may receive up to 1.7 RINs per gallon, whereas biodiesel currently receives 1.5 RINs per gallon. As the value of RINs increases, this 0.2 RIN advantage may make renewable hydrocarbon diesel more cost-effective, both as a\npetroleum-based diesel substitute and for meeting RFS2 requirements. If renewable hydrocarbon diesel proves to be more cost-effective than biodiesel, revenues from our biodiesel plants and our results of operations would be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, the EPA may allow other fuels to satisfy the RFS2 requirements and allow RINs to be generated upon the production of these fuels. The EPA recently adopted regulations to amend the definition of \u201cHome Heating Oil\u201d under RFS2, which expands the scope of fuels eligible to generate RINs.\nThe biomass-based diesel industry will also face increased competition resulting from the advancement of technology by automotive, industrial and power generation manufacturers which are developing more efficient engines, hybrid engines and alternative clean power systems. Improved engines and alternative clean power systems offer a technological solution to address increasing worldwide energy costs, the long-term availability of petroleum reserves and environmental concerns. If and when these clean power systems are able to offer significant efficiency and environmental benefits and become widely available, the biomass-based diesel industry may not be able to compete effectively with these technologies and government requirements for the use of biofuels may not continue.\nThe development of alternative fuels and renewable chemicals also puts pressure on feedstock supply and availability to the biomass-based diesel industry. If these emerging technologies compete with biomass-based diesel for feedstocks, are more profitable or have greater governmental support than biomass-based diesel does, then the biomass-based diesel industry may have difficulty in procuring the feedstocks necessary to be successful.\nIncreased industry-wide production of biomass-based diesel could have a negative effect on our margins and there remains excess production capacity in the biomass-based diesel industry.\nAccording to the National Biodiesel Board, or NBB, as of September 12, 2012, 2.7 billion gallons per year of biodiesel production capacity in the United States was registered under the RFS2 program by NBB members. In addition to this amount, several hundred more gallons of U.S. based biomass-based diesel production capacity was registered by non-NBB members and another 1.2 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel production was registered by foreign producers. Furthermore, plants under construction and expansion in the United States as of December 31 2011, if completed, could add an additional several hundred million gallons of annual biodiesel production capacity. The annual production capacity of existing plants and plants under construction far exceeds both historic consumption of biomass-based diesel in the United States and required consumption under RFS2. If this excess production capacity was fully utilized for the U.S. market, it would increase competition for our feedstocks, increase the volume of biomass-based diesel on the market and may reduce biomass-based diesel gross margins, harming our revenues and profitability.\nThe European Commission has imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duties on biodiesel blends imported into Europe, which have effectively eliminated our ability to sell those biodiesel blends in Europe.\nIn March 2009, as a response to the BTC, the European Commission imposed anti-dumping and anti-subsidy tariffs on biodiesel produced in the United States. These tariffs have effectively eliminated European demand for 20% biodiesel blends, or B20, or higher imported from the United States. The European Commission has extended these tariffs through 2014. In May 2011, the European Commission imposed similar anti-dumping and countervailing duties on biodiesel blends below B20. These duties significantly increase the price at which we and other United States biodiesel producers will be able to sell such biodiesel blends in European markets, making it difficult or impossible to compete in the European biodiesel market. These anti-dumping and countervailing duties therefore decrease the demand for biodiesel produced in the United States and increase the supply of biodiesel available in the United States market. Such market dynamics may negatively impact our revenues and profitability.\nIf automobile manufacturers and other industry groups express reservations regarding the use of biodiesel, our ability to sell biodiesel will be negatively impacted.\nBecause it is a relatively new product compared with petroleum diesel, research on biodiesel use in automobiles is ongoing. While most heavy duty automobile manufacturers have approved blends of up to 20% biodiesel, some industry groups have recommended that blends of no more than 5% biodiesel be used for automobile fuel due to concerns about fuel quality, engine performance problems and possible detrimental effects of biodiesel on rubber components and other engine parts. Although some manufacturers have encouraged use of biodiesel fuel in their vehicles, cautionary pronouncements by other manufacturers or industry groups may impact our ability to market our biodiesel.\nPerception about \u201cfood vs. fuel\u201d could impact public policy which could impair our ability to operate at a profit and substantially harm our revenues and operating margins.\nSome people believe that biomass-based diesel may increase the cost of food, as some feedstocks such as soybean oil used to make biomass-based diesel can also be used for food products. This debate is often referred to as \u201cfood vs. fuel.\u201d This is a concern to the biomass-based diesel industry because biomass-based diesel demand is heavily influenced by government policy and if public opinion were to erode, it is possible that these policies would lose political support. These views could also\nnegatively impact public perception of biomass-based diesel. Such claims have led some, including members of Congress, to urge the modification of current government policies which affect the production and sale of biofuels in the United States.\nConcerns regarding the environmental impact of biomass-based diesel production could affect public policy which could impair our ability to operate at a profit and substantially harm our revenues and operating margins.\nUnder the EISA, the EPA is required to produce a study every three years of the environmental impacts associated with current and future biofuel production and use, including effects on air and water quality, soil quality and conservation, water availability, energy recovery from secondary materials, ecosystem health and biodiversity, invasive species and international impacts. The first such triennial report was released in February 2012. The 2012 report concludes that (1) the extent of negative impacts to date are limited in magnitude and are primarily associated with the intensification of corn production; (2) whether future impacts are positive or negative will be determined by the choice of feedstock, land use change, cultivation and conservation practices; and (3) realizing potential benefits will require implementation and monitoring of conservation and best management practices, improvements in production efficiency, and implementation of innovative technologies at commercial scales. Should future EPA triennial studies, or other analyses find that biofuel production and use has resulted in, or could in the future result in, adverse environmental impacts, such findings could also negatively impact public perception of biofuel and acceptance of biofuel as an alternative fuel, which also could result in the loss of political support.\nTo the extent that state or federal laws are modified or public perception turns against biomass-based diesel, use requirements such as RFS2 and state tax incentives may not continue, which could materially harm our ability to operate profitably.\nProblems with product performance, in cold weather or otherwise, could cause consumers to lose confidence in the reliability of biodiesel which, in turn, would have an adverse impact on our ability to successfully market and sell biodiesel.\nConcerns about the performance of biodiesel could result in a decrease in customers and revenues and an unexpected increase in expenses. Biodiesel typically has a higher cloud point than petroleum-based diesel. The cloud point is the temperature below which a fuel exhibits a noticeable cloudiness and is the conventional indicator of a fuel\u2019s potential for cold weather problems. The lower the cloud point, the better the fuel should perform in cold weather. According to an article published by Iowa State University Extension, the cloud point of biodiesel is typically between 30 \u00b0F and 60 \u00b0F, while the cloud point of the most common form of pure petroleum-based diesel fuel is typically less than 20 \u00b0F. It is our experience that when biodiesel is mixed with pure petroleum-based diesel to make a two percent biodiesel blend, the cloud point of the blended fuel can be 2 \u00b0F to 6 \u00b0F higher than petroleum-based diesel and the cloud point of a twenty percent biodiesel blend can be 15 \u00b0F to 35 \u00b0F higher than petroleum based diesel, depending on the individual cloud points of the biodiesel and petroleum-based diesel. Cold temperatures can therefore cause biodiesel blended fuel to become cloudy and eventually to gel when pure petroleum-based diesel would not, and this can lead to plugged fuel filters and other fuel handling and performance problems for customers and suppliers. The consequences of these higher cloud points may cause demand for biodiesel in northern and eastern United States markets to diminish during the colder months, which are the primary markets in which we currently operate.\nThe tendency of biodiesel to gel in colder weather may also result in long-term storage problems. In cold climates, fuel may need to be stored in a heated building or heated storage tanks, which result in higher storage costs. This and other performance problems, including the possibility of particulate formation above the cloud point of a blend of biodiesel and petroleum-based diesel, may also result in increased expenses as we try to remedy these performance problems, including the costs of extra cold weather treatment additives. Remedying these performance problems may result in decreased yields, lower process throughput or both, as well as substantial capital costs. Any reduction in the demand for our biodiesel product, or the production capacity of our facilities will reduce our revenues and have an adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.\nGrowth in the sale and distribution of biomass-based diesel is dependent on the expansion of related infrastructure which may not occur on a timely basis, if at all, and our operations could be adversely affected by infrastructure limitations or disruptions.\nGrowth in the biomass-based diesel industry depends on substantial development of infrastructure for the distribution of biodiesel. Substantial investment required for these infrastructure changes and expansions may not be made on a timely basis or at all. The scope and timing of any infrastructure expansion are generally beyond our control. Also, we compete with other biofuel companies for access to some of the key infrastructure components such as pipeline and terminal capacity. As a result, increased production of biomass-based diesel will increase the demand and competition for necessary infrastructure. Any delay or failure in expanding distribution infrastructure could hurt the demand for or prices of biomass-based diesel, impede delivery of our biomass-based diesel, and impose additional costs, each of which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our business will be dependent on the continuing availability of infrastructure for the\ndistribution of increasing volumes of biomass-based diesel and any infrastructure disruptions could materially harm our business.\nWe face competition from imported biodiesel and renewable hydrocarbon diesel, which may reduce demand for biomass-based produced by us and cause our revenues and profits to decline.\nBiodiesel and renewable hydrocarbon diesel imports into the United States have increased significantly and compete with United States produced biodiesel. The imported fuels may benefit from production incentives or other financial incentives in their home countries that offset some of their production costs and enable them to profitably sell biodiesel or renewable hydrocarbon diesel in the United States at lower prices than United States-based biodiesel producers. Under RFS2, imported biodiesel and renewable hydrocarbon diesel is eligible and, therefore, competes to meet the volumetric requirements for biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuels. If imports continue to increase, this could make it more challenging for us to market or sell biomass-based diesel in the United States, which would have a material adverse effect on our revenues. In January 2015, the EPA announced the approval for Argentinian biodiesel made from soybean oil to earn RINs. Imported biomass-based diesel that does not qualify under RFS2, also competes in jurisdictions where there are biomass-based diesel blending requirements.\nNitrogen oxide emissions from biodiesel may harm its appeal as a renewable fuel and increase costs.\nIn some instances, biodiesel may increase emissions of nitrogen oxide as compared to petroleum-based diesel fuel, which could harm air quality. Nitrogen oxide is a contributor to ozone and smog. New Technology Diesel Engines eliminate any such increase. Emissions from older vehicles while the fleet turns over may decrease the appeal of biodiesel to environmental groups and agencies who have been historic supporters of the biodiesel industry, potentially harming our ability to market our biodiesel.\nIn addition, several states may act to regulate potential nitrogen oxide emissions from biodiesel. California recently adopted regulations that may limit the volume of biodiesel that can be used or require an additive to reduce potential emissions. In states where such an additive is required to sell biodiesel, the additional cost of the additive may make biodiesel less profitable or make biodiesel less cost competitive against petroleum-based diesel or renewable hydrocarbon diesel, which would negatively impact our ability to sell our products in such states and therefore have an adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nSeveral biofuels companies throughout the United States have filed for bankruptcy over the last several years due to industry and economic conditions.\nA volatile regulatory environment, lack of debt or equity investments and volatile biofuel prices and feedstock costs have likely contributed to the necessity of bankruptcy filings by biofuel producers. Our business has been, and in the future may be, negatively impacted by the industry conditions that influenced the bankruptcy proceedings of other biofuel producers, or we may encounter new competition from buyers of distressed biodiesel properties who enter the industry at a lower cost than original plant investors.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile.\nAlthough there is currently an active and liquid trading market for our common stock, the market price for our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in the performance or market valuations of other companies engaged in our industry;\n\u2022\nissuance of new or updated research reports by securities or industry analysts;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by us or of securities or industry analysts;\n\u2022\ninvestors\u2019 general perception of us and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nchanges in the political climate in the industry in which we operate, existing laws, regulations and policies applicable to our business and products, including RFS2, and the continuation or adoption or failure to continue or adopt renewable energy requirements and incentives, including the BTC;\n\u2022\nother regulatory developments in our industry affecting us, our customers or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncement or expectation of additional financing efforts, including sales or expected sales of additional common stock;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key management or other personnel;\n\u2022\nlitigation;\n\u2022\ninadequate trading volume;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions in our industry; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions, including continued dislocations and downward pressure in the capital markets.\nIn addition, stock markets generally and from time to time experience significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may have material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe may issue additional common stock as consideration for future investments or acquisitions.\nWe have issued in the past, and may issue in the future, our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions. The amount of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have paid no cash dividends on any of our classes of common stock to date, have contractual restrictions against paying cash dividends and currently intend to retain our future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, stockholders must look solely to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment. This appreciation may not occur. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in our common stock.\nDelaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws will contain anti-takeover provisions that could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\nthe right of the board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement for advance notice for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the board of directors to alter our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with rights set by the board of directors, which rights could be senior to those of common stock;\n\u2022\na classified board;\n\u2022\nthe required approval of holders of at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws or amend or repeal the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation regarding the classified board, the election and removal of directors and the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent; and\n\u2022\nthe elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and to take action by written consent.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL. These provisions may prohibit or restrict large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us. These provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts and could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in our market price being lower than it would without these provisions.\nIf securities or industry analysts issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock or do not publish research or reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. It is difficult for companies such as ours to attract independent equity research analysts to cover our common stock. We do not control these analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our common stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our common stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business. Although there is currently an active and liquid trading market for REG common stock, if one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline and the market for our common stock to become illiquid.", "PERMNO": 13201, "SIC": 2990, "TIC": "REGI"}
