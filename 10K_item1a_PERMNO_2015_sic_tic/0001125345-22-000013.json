RISK FACTORS\nThe discussion below addresses material factors, of which we are currently aware, that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Many of the following risks and uncertainties are, and will be, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and any worsening of the global business and economic environment as a result. These risk factors and other forward-looking statements that relate to future events, expectations, trends and operating periods involve certain factors that are subject to change, and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties should not be considered a complete discussion of all the risks and uncertainties we may face and although the risks are organized by headings and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated.\nSummary of Risk Factors Affecting Our Business\nOur business is subject to numerous risks. The following summary highlights some of the risks you should consider with respect to our business and prospects. This summary is not complete and the risks summarized below are not the only risks we face. You should review and consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which includes a more complete discussion of the risks summarized below as well as a discussion of other risks related to our business and an investment in our common stock, as well as our other SEC filings.\n\u2022We depend substantially on the success of the clinical development of our products and product candidates, through our own efforts or those of our collaborators, including MGC018. If we are unable to successfully complete clinical development, obtain additional regulatory approvals and commercialize our products and product candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues and cash flows to continue our operations.\n\u2022Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process, with a highly uncertain outcome. We expect to incur significant additional costs related to the development of MGC018 and our other product candidates and may experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our other products and product candidates.\n\u2022We have incurred significant losses since inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. Our first commercial product, MARGENZA, launched in March 2021 and to date has not resulted in revenues sufficient for us to reach profitability. Accordingly, we may never achieve or sustain profitability.\n\u2022If clinical trials for our product candidates are prolonged, delayed or stopped for any reason, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis, which would require us to incur additional costs and delay our receipt of any product revenue.\n\u2022We will require substantial additional funding, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, and, if not available, may require us to delay, scale back, or cease our product development programs or operations.\n\u2022The results of previous clinical trials may not be predictive of future results, and interim or top line data may be subject to change or qualification based the complete analysis of data. In addition, the results of our current or planned clinical trials may not satisfy the requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or non-U.S. regulatory authorities for product approval.\n\u2022We use or may use novel technologies in the development of our product candidates and the FDA and other regulatory authorities have not approved or may not approve products that utilize these technologies.\n\u2022We may not be successful in our efforts to use and expand our technology platforms to build a pipeline of product candidates. We may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\n\u2022MGC018, MARGENZA, or any other product candidate that we develop may fail to achieve or maintain market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\n\u2022Our existing therapeutic collaborations are important to our business, and future collaborations may also be important to us. If we are unable to maintain any of these collaborations, or if these collaborations are not successful, our business could be adversely affected.\n\u2022Our product candidates may have undesirable side effects which may delay or prevent further clinical development or marketing approval, or, if approval is received, require them to be taken off the market, require them to include safety warnings or otherwise limit their sales.\n\u2022Our manufacturing facilities are subject to significant government regulations and approvals, which are often costly and could result in adverse consequences to our business if we fail to comply with the regulations or maintain the approvals.\n\u2022The manufacture of MGC018, MARGENZA and our product candidates, for ourselves and our collaborators, is complex, and we may encounter difficulties in production. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively manufacture clinical quantities of our product candidates in the future. Further, we have limited experience in large-scale or commercial manufacturing, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively manufacture commercial quantities of MARGENZA, or other products or product candidates, if and when approved.\n\u2022The current or future impact of the COVID-19 (or any variant thereof) pandemic may have significant negative impact on our clinical trials, preclinical studies, development, manufacturing and commercialization of our product and product candidates and other aspects of our business, staff, and operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, both now and in the future, adversely affects our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity, will depend on future developments, including but not limited to the measures taken by public and private entities in response to the pandemic, which remain highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\n\u2022We have limited experience in launching and marketing our internally developed products. If we are unable to further develop marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our products, or our existing arrangements are not successful, we may not be able to generate substantial product sales revenue.\n\u2022We face significant competition and if our competitors continue to develop and market products that are more effective, safer or less expensive than our product and our product candidates, our current or future commercial opportunities may be negatively impacted.\n\u2022Actual or anticipated changes to the laws and regulations governing the health care system may have a negative impact on cost and access to health insurance coverage and reimbursement of health care items and services.\n\u2022Reimbursement decisions by third-party payors, including government payors, may have an adverse effect on pricing and market acceptance.\n\u2022If any product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us or any of our collaborators, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates.\n\u2022Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish substantial rights.\n\u2022We contract with, and may in the future contract with, third parties for the distribution and commercialization of MARGENZA and our other product candidates. Failure of third-party contractors to successfully perform their obligations for commercialization, distribution, or other services could harm out ability to commercialize our product or product candidates.\n\u2022Our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the valid patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.\n\u2022If we are unable to obtain and enforce patent protection for our products and our product candidates and related technology, our business could be materially harmed.\n\u2022We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022Our future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\n\u2022We are subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention and adversely impact our business.\n\u2022Failure to successfully develop and commercialize companion diagnostics with third party contractors for use with our product candidates could harm our ability to commercialize our product candidates.\n\u2022If we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business and the Development and Commercialization of Our Products and Product Candidates\nWe depend substantially on the success of the clinical development of our products and product candidates, through our own efforts or those of our collaborators, including MGC018. If we are unable to successfully complete clinical development, obtain additional regulatory approvals and commercialize our products and product candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues and cash flows to continue our operations.\nOur business depends on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our products and product candidates, including MGC018. We have invested and will continue to invest a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of our product candidates, including MGC018. The success of our products and product candidates depends on many factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials, as well as completion of preclinical studies;\n\u2022safety and favorable efficacy and acceptable safety data from our clinical trials and other studies\n\u2022the sufficiency of our financial resources and ability to obtain additional funding for the development of our products and product candidates;\n\u2022receipt of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022the performance by clinical research organizations (CROs) or other third parties we may retain of their duties to us in a manner that complies with our protocols and applicable laws and that protects the integrity of the resulting data;\n\u2022obtaining and maintaining patent, trade secret and other intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity;\n\u2022ensuring we do not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the valid patent, trade secret or other intellectual property rights of third parties;\n\u2022successfully launching our product candidates, including MGC018, if and when approved;\n\u2022maintaining commercial manufacturing capabilities, either by utilizing our current manufacturing facilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\u2022manufacturing or obtaining sufficient supplies of our products and product candidates that may be necessary for use in clinical trials for evaluation of our product candidates and commercialization of our products;\n\u2022obtaining favorable reimbursement from third-party payors for products and product candidates;\n\u2022competition with other products;\n\u2022post-marketing commitments to regulatory agencies following regulatory approval; and\n\u2022continued acceptable safety profile following regulatory approval.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process, with a highly uncertain outcome. We expect to incur significant additional costs related to the development of MGC018 and our other product candidates and may experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our other products and product candidates.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, marketing and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and non-U.S. regulatory authorities, which regulations differ from country to country. We are not permitted to market our product candidates in the United States or in other countries until we receive\napproval of a Biologics License Application (BLA) from the FDA or marketing approval from applicable regulatory authorities outside the United States. Our product candidates are in various stages of development and are subject to the risks of failure inherent in drug development. For example, in November 2021, we announced the discontinuation of Cohort A of the MAHOGANY trial for margetuxumab in gastric cancer, based on a number of factors, including the prioritization of our other product candidates given the competition in this indication, and the FDA\u2019s approval of competing combination therapy with pembrolizumab. In addition, our collaborator Incyte submitted a BLA for retifanlimab in January 2021 and in July 2021, received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA regarding its BLA. Incyte\u2019s announcement indicated that the FDA determined that additional data are needed to demonstrate the clinical benefit of retifanlimab for the submitted indication, and that Incyte is reviewing the CRL and will discuss next steps with the FDA. Obtaining approval of a BLA can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. Further, in October 2021, Incyte withdrew its European application for marketing authorization of retifanlimab for the treatment of squamous carcinoma of the anal canal. In addition, failure to comply with FDA and non-U.S. regulatory requirements may, either before or after product approval, subject our company or our collaborators to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:\n\u2022restrictions on our ability to conduct clinical trials, including full or partial clinical holds on ongoing or planned trials;\n\u2022restrictions on the products, manufacturers, manufacturing facilities or manufacturing process;\n\u2022warning letters;\n\u2022civil and criminal penalties;\n\u2022injunctions;\n\u2022suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022product seizures, detentions or import bans;\n\u2022voluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements;\n\u2022total or partial suspension of production;\n\u2022imposition of restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; and\n\u2022refusal to approve pending BLAs or supplements to approved BLAs or analogous marketing approvals outside the United States.\nThe FDA and foreign regulatory authorities also have substantial discretion in the drug approval process. The number of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for regulatory approval varies depending on the product candidate, the disease or condition that the product candidate is designed to address, and the regulations applicable to any particular drug candidate. Regulatory agencies can delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including:\n\u2022a product candidate may not be deemed safe or effective;\n\u2022the results may not confirm the positive results from earlier preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022regulatory agencies may not find the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials sufficient or meaningful;\n\u2022regulatory agencies might not approve or might require changes to our manufacturing processes or facilities; or\n\u2022regulatory agencies may change their approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nAny delay in obtaining or failure to obtain required approvals could materially adversely affect our ability to generate revenue from the particular product candidate, which likely would result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely impact our stock price. Furthermore, any regulatory approval to market a product may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market the product. These limitations may limit the size of the potential market for a product candidate, if approved.\nIf clinical trials for our product candidates are prolonged, delayed or stopped, for any reason, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis, which would require us to incur additional costs and delay our receipt of any product revenue.\nWe, or our collaborators, are either currently enrolling patients in clinical trials or anticipate initiating, continuing, or designing clinical trials for molecules that include MGC018, lorigerlimab, enoblituzumab, retifanlimab, tebotelimab, IMGC936 and MGD024 as monotherapies or in combination with other product candidates. In addition, Incyte is currently enrolling patients in clinical trials for retifanlimab, and other collaborators outside the United States are developing our product candidates. We anticipate in the future collaborators will initiate or continue clinical trials of one or more our product candidates. The continuation, modification, or commencement of existing or new clinical trials could be substantially delayed or prevented by several factors, including:\n\u2022further discussions with the FDA or other regulatory agencies regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials;\n\u2022the limited number of, and competition for, suitable sites to conduct our clinical trials, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial programs, including some that may be for the same indication as our product candidates;\n\u2022any delay or failure in patient recruitment or enrollment in our or our collaborators\u2019 trials for any reason, including as a result of public health crises such as the evolving COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022 any delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval or agreement to commence a clinical trial in any of the countries where enrollment is planned;\n\u2022inability to obtain sufficient funds required for a clinical trial;\n\u2022clinical holds on, or other regulatory objections to, a new or ongoing clinical trial;\n\u2022delay or failure to manufacture sufficient supplies of the product candidate for our clinical trials;\n\u2022delay or failure to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial terms or clinical trial protocols with prospective sites or CROs the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different sites or CROs;\n\u2022delay or failure to obtain institutional review board (IRB) approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site;\n\u2022significant competition of product candidates that are expected to be more effective or have a more favorable safety profile; and\n\u2022approval of potential combination therapies by competitors.\nThe progress or completion of our, or our collaborators', clinical trials could also be substantially delayed or prevented by many factors, including:\n\u2022delays in expected site initiation, patient recruitment and enrollment, for any reason, including as a result of public health crises such as the evolving COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022failure of patients to complete the clinical trial;\n\u2022unforeseen safety issues, including severe or unexpected drug-related adverse effects experienced by patients, including possible deaths;\n\u2022lack of efficacy during clinical trials;\n\u2022termination of our clinical trials by one or more clinical trial sites;\n\u2022inability or unwillingness of patients or clinical investigators to follow our clinical trial protocols;\n\u2022economic and political instability in countries where our trial sites are located, including terrorist attacks, civil unrest and actual or threatened armed conflict;\n\u2022inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment by us, our collaboration partners and/or our CROs; and\n\u2022the need to repeat or terminate clinical trials as a result of inconclusive or negative results or unforeseen complications in testing.\nChanges in regulatory requirements and guidance may also occur and we may need to significantly amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes with appropriate regulatory authorities. Amendments may require us to renegotiate terms with CROs or resubmit clinical trial protocols to IRBs for re-examination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. Our clinical trials may be suspended or terminated at any time by the FDA, other regulatory authorities, the IRB overseeing the clinical trial at issue, any of our clinical trial sites with respect to that site, or us, due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;\n\u2022unforeseen safety issues or any determination that a clinical trial presents unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial due to unforeseen costs or other business decisions; and\n\u2022upon a breach or pursuant to the terms of any agreement with, or for any other reason by, current or future collaborators that have responsibility for the clinical development of any of our product candidates.\nClinical trials of our product candidates are subject to partial or full clinical holds from time to time. For example, the Investigational New Drug (IND) submission for MGD024 announced in November 2021 has not yet been accepted by the FDA while we address their comments on the submission. The trial start is on hold, pending alignment with the FDA. We believe we are able to address the FDA\u2019s comments and the MGD024 IND submission will be accepted for filing. A clinical hold received in the midst of conducting a trial may delay the progress of a clinical trial, or may require us to modify or discontinue such trial. Any failure or significant delay in completing clinical trials for our product candidates would adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval and our commercial prospects and ability to generate product revenue will be diminished.\nThe results of previous clinical trials may not be predictive of future results, and interim or top line data may be subject to change or qualification, based on several factors, including a complete analysis of data, or in the case of interim analysis, the continued or ongoing accrual of data. In addition, the results of our current and planned clinical trials may not satisfy the requirements of the FDA or non-U.S. regulatory authorities for product approval.\nClinical failure can occur at any stage of clinical development. Clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we or any of our current and future collaborators may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical or preclinical testing. Success in early clinical trials does not mean that future larger registration clinical trials will be successful because product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA and non-U.S. regulatory authorities despite having progressed through initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including those with greater resources and experience than us, have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after obtaining promising results in earlier clinical trials.\nWe may publicly disclose top line or interim data from time to time, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial or continued progress of the study or trial. The top line or interim results that we report may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Top line and interim data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. In addition, the achievement of one primary endpoint for a trial does not guarantee that additional co-primary endpoints or secondary endpoints will be achieved, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain or retain additional regulatory approval of MARGENZA and our product candidates in the U.S. or in other jurisdictions.\nWe use or may use novel technologies in the development of our product candidates and the FDA and other regulatory authorities have not approved products that utilize these technologies.\nOur products in development are based on our technology platforms, including Fc Optimization, DART and TRIDENT technologies. Given the novelty of these technologies, we intend to work closely with the FDA and other regulatory authorities to perform the requisite scientific analyses and evaluation of our methods to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. Even though MARGENZA, which incorporates an Fc variation created using our Fc Optimization platform, was approved by the FDA, there is no assurance that the FDA will approve future product candidates using such technology. The validation process takes time and resources, may require independent third-party analyses, and may not be accepted by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. For some of our product candidates that are based on these technology platforms, the regulatory approval path and requirements may not be clear or evolve as more data becomes available for this product candidates, which could add significant delay and expense. Delays or failure to obtain regulatory approval of any of the product candidates that we develop would adversely affect our business.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to use and expand our technology platforms to build a pipeline of product candidates. We may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nA key element of our strategy is to use and expand our technology platforms to continue to build a pipeline of product candidates and progress several of these product candidates through clinical development for the treatment of a variety of different types of diseases. Although our research and development efforts to date have resulted in a pipeline of product candidates directed at various cancers, as well as autoimmune disorders and infectious diseases, we may not be able to develop product candidates that are safe and effective. Even if we are successful in continuing to build our pipeline, the potential product candidates that we identify may not be suitable for initial or continued clinical development, including as a result of being shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be products that will receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance. If we do not continue to successfully develop and begin to commercialize product candidates, we will face difficulty in obtaining product revenues in future periods, which could result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely affect our stock price.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on research programs and product candidates that we identify for specific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights.\nMGC018, MARGENZA, or any other product candidate that we develop may fail to achieve or maintain market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nMGC018, MARGENZA, or any other product candidate that we develop may fail to achieve or maintain market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success. For example, revenues from MARGENZA are unlikely to enable us to reach profitability.\nIf product candidates that we develop do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of any product candidates that we develop will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022the efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022the prevalence and severity of any side effects; any safety events that may have occurred in connection with the development of the product candidate;\n\u2022our ability to offer our products for sale at competitive prices;\n\u2022the convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022the willingness of physicians to prescribe the product or other new therapies, and of the patient population to try the product or these therapies;\n\u2022the strength of marketing, sales, and distribution support;\n\u2022the availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement; and\n\u2022any restrictions on the use of our products together with other medications.\nA product\u2019s market acceptance depends significantly on the medical community\u2019s determination of clinical benefit and safety compared to alternative therapies available both now and in the future. For example. several new therapies for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer have recently been approved. Certain of these therapies may have or may be perceived to have greater efficacy benefits than MARGENZA in clinical trials. Competition from recently approved therapies has and may adversely impact the market acceptance of MARGENZA. In particular, final overall survival (OS) endpoint data from the SOPHIA trial analysis did not demonstrate a statistically significant advantage for MARGENZA over trastuzumab. This OS data may adversely affect the market acceptance of MARGENZA.\nIn addition, the potential market opportunities for our product candidates are difficult to precisely estimate. Our internal estimates of the potential market opportunities for MGC018 and our other product candidates include several key assumptions based on a variety of factors, which may include our industry knowledge, industry publications, third-party research reports, assessment of competition, and other surveys. While we believe that our internal assumptions are reasonable, no independent source has verified such assumptions. If any of these assumptions proves to be inaccurate, then the actual market for MGC018, our other product candidates could be smaller than our estimates of our potential market opportunity.\n\u202fOur product candidates may have undesirable side effects which may delay or prevent further clinical development or marketing approval, or, if approval is received, require them to be taken off the market, require them to include safety warnings or otherwise limit their sales.\nAlthough all of our product candidates have undergone or will undergo safety testing, not all adverse effects of drugs can be predicted or anticipated. Unforeseen side effects from any of our product candidates could arise either during clinical development or after the approved product has been marketed. Ongoing or future trials of our product candidates may not support the conclusion that one or more of these product candidates have acceptable safety profiles. The results of future clinical or preclinical trials may show that our product candidates cause undesirable or unacceptable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials, and result in delay of, or failure to obtain, marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities, or result in marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities with restrictive label warnings or potential product liability claims.\nIf we or others later identify undesirable or unacceptable side effects caused by such products:\n\u2022regulatory authorities may require us to take our approved product off the market;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, specific warnings, a contraindication or field alerts to physicians and pharmacies;\n\u2022we may be required to change the way the product is administered, impose other risk-management measures, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product;\n\u2022we may be subject to limitations on how we may promote the product;\n\u2022sales of the product may decrease significantly;\n\u2022we may be subject to litigation or product liability claims; and\n\u2022our reputation may suffer.\nFor example, the prescribing information for MARGENZA include warnings and precautions for infusion-related reactions, as well as a boxed warning related to left ventricular dysfunction and embryo-fetal toxicity. Further, based on the identification of future adverse events, we may be required to further revise the prescribing information, including MARGENZA\u2019s boxed warning, which could negatively impact sales of MARGENZA or adversely affect MARGENZA\u2019s acceptance in the market.\nAny of these events could prevent us, our collaborators or our potential future partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenue from the sale of our products.\nOur manufacturing facilities are subject to significant government regulations and approvals, which are often costly and could result in adverse consequences to our business if we fail to comply with the regulations or maintain the approvals.\nWe must comply with the FDA\u2019s current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) requirements, as set out in statute, regulations and interpreted through guidance. We may encounter difficulties in achieving quality control and quality assurance and may experience shortages in qualified personnel. We are subject to inspections by the FDA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. See \u201cOther U.S. Post-Marketing Regulatory Requirements\u201d above for additional information. Any failure to follow cGMP or other regulatory requirements or delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, fill-finish, packaging, or storage of our product or product candidates as a result of a failure of our facilities or the facilities or operations of third parties to comply with regulatory requirements or pass any regulatory authority inspection could significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize our product or product candidates, including leading to significant delays in the availability of drug product for sale and our clinical trials or the termination or hold on a clinical trial, or the delay or prevention of a filing or approval of marketing applications for our product candidates. Significant noncompliance could also result in the imposition of sanctions, including fines, injunctions,\ncivil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approvals for our product candidates, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could damage our reputation or negatively impact a product\u2019s commercial success. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our product candidates and/or may be subject to product recalls, seizures, injunctions, or criminal prosecution.\nThe manufacture of MGC018, MARGENZA and our other product candidates, for ourselves and our collaborators, is complex, and we may encounter difficulties in production. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively manufacture clinical quantities of our product candidates in the future. Further, we have limited experience in large-scale or commercial manufacturing, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively manufacture commercial quantities of MARGENZA, or other products or product candidates, if and when approved.\nWe currently manufacture product and product candidates for ourselves and our collaborators in our in-house manufacturing facilities, and we anticipate manufacturing both commercial product as well as product candidates in the future, including for example commercial manufacturing of MARGENZA. We have limited experience in manufacturing at commercial scale. The process of commercial or clinical biotechnology manufacturing for ourselves and our collaborators is highly susceptible to delays or product loss due to a variety of factors, including but not limited to contamination, equipment failure, improper installation or operation of equipment, vendor or operator error, inconsistency in yields, variability in product characteristics, difficulties in scaling the production process, and vendor supply chain disruptions or fluctuations. Even minor deviations from manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects and other supply disruptions. If microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered in MARGENZA and our product candidates or in the manufacturing facilities in which MARGENZA and our product candidates are made, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination. Any adverse developments affecting manufacturing operations for MARGENZA and our product candidates, if any are approved, may result in shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls, or other interruptions in the supply of our products. We may also have to take inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expenses for products that fail to meet specifications, undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives. In addition, if we fail to supply required quantities of MARGENZA or a product candidate for one of our collaborators, our collaborator may terminate our agreement.\nWe also rely on third parties to manufacture certain components of our products or product candidates. See risk factor \u201cRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties - We contract with, and may in the future contract with, third parties for components of the manufacturing of MARGENZA and our other product candidates. Failure of third-party contractors to successfully perform their obligations could harm our ability to develop or commercialize our product or product candidates\u201d below.\nAlthough we currently maintain insurance coverage against damage to our property and to cover business interruption and research and development restoration expenses, our insurance coverage may not reimburse us, or may not be sufficient to reimburse us, for any expenses or losses we may suffer. If there were to be a catastrophic event or failure of our manufacturing facilities or processes, we may be unable to meet our requirements for supply of MARGENZA and our product candidates.\nThe current or future impact of the COVID-19 (or any variant thereof) pandemic has had, and may continue to have, significant negative impact on our clinical trials, preclinical studies, development, manufacturing and commercialization of our product candidates and other aspects of our business, staff, and operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, both now and in the future, adversely affects our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity, will depend on future developments, including but not limited to the measures taken by public and private entities in response to the pandemic, which remain highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nPublic health crises such as pandemics or similar outbreaks has, and may continue to have, a material impact our business. The COVID-19 pandemic and its variants continue to evolve, and to date have led to the implementation of various responses, including government-imposed quarantines, work and travel restrictions and other public health safety measures at the federal, state and local levels.\nThe continued spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material impact on our clinical trials, preclinical studies, commercialization efforts, manufacturing and development of our product candidates and other aspects of our business, staff, and operations, which in turn may impact our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic impaired our ability to enroll patients in clinical trials, continue ongoing clinical trials or activate clinical trial sites, and MARGENZA commercialization, due to, for example, heightened exposure to COVID-19 if an outbreak occurs in a specific geography, the shifting of healthcare resources toward the pandemic or the closing of or limiting of access to clinical facilities, and reduced or eliminated in-person access to physicians and health care centers. Furthermore, patients may be unable or unwilling to enroll in our clinical trials or be unable to comply with clinical\ntrial protocols if COVID-19 related restrictions impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. Government-imposed quarantines and other restrictions may also require us to temporarily suspend activity at our clinical sites. The COVID-19 pandemic may also negatively affect the operations of third-party CROs that we rely upon to carry out our clinical trials, or the operations of other service providers, which could result in delays or disruptions in the supply of our product candidates or other aspects of our business or that of our collaborators. Any negative impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had, or will have, on patient enrollment or treatment or the timing and execution of our clinical trials could cause delays to our clinical trial activities, which could adversely affect our ability to seek and obtain regulatory approval for and to commercialize any approved product candidates, increase our operating expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nFurther, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk that a portion of the workforce, including ours, may suffer illness or otherwise be unable or unwilling to work due to close contact related precautions or due to choosing not to comply with vaccine mandates for healthcare workers. To date, we have seen limited business impact from COVID-19 related absences, but there can be no assurance that there will not be additional or significant employee COVID-19 related absences with negative business impact in the future. We have maintained an on-site workforce and implemented stay-at-home orders consistent with the requirements of the jurisdictions in which we operate, with arrangements such as remote work and flexible schedules for certain functions, as well as other measures intended to reduce the risks to our employees from the impact of the pandemic while maintaining our operations. Re-opening our offices could expose our employees to health risks, and us to associated liability, and could create additional risks and operational challenges that require us to make additional investments in the design, implementation and enforcement of new workplace health and safety protocols. We expect many employees to continue to work remotely or a hybrid of in-person and remote work, which presents risks, uncertainties and costs that could affect our performance, including operational and workplace culture challenges and uncertainty regarding office space needs. In addition, we implemented a company-wide vaccination requirement by the end of 2021, with certain exceptions. To date, we do not believe our vaccination requirement has resulted in workforce attrition nor will it result in material difficulty securing future labor needs. If employee attrition is significant, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe may also face increased cybersecurity risks due to the shifting of a majority of our corporate functions operating remotely in regions impacted the virus. Increased levels of remote access may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to attempt to exploit vulnerabilities, and our employees may be more susceptible to phishing and social engineering attempts.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, staff, operations, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, or those of our collaborators, will largely depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, such as the duration of the pandemic, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and its variants or the effectiveness of actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, an extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption as a result of the pandemic, among others. We cannot presently predict the scope and severity of any potential government or business shutdowns or disruptions. If we or any of the third parties with whom we engage experience shutdowns or other business disruptions, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned could be materially and negatively affected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have limited experience in launching and marketing products. If we are unable to further develop marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our products, or our existing arrangements are not successful, we may not be able to generate substantial product sales revenue.\nIn December 2020, the FDA approved MARGENZA, in combination with chemotherapy, for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 regimens, at least one of which was for metastatic disease. We launched MARGENZA in March 2021. In conjunction with Eversana Life Science Services, LLC (Eversana), we continue to build commercialization support in United States to commercialize MARGENZA in a manner we believe to be appropriate in light of the modest size of the market opportunity. We have limited internal commercialization capabilities, and any additional products or product candidates that we may develop or in-license, will require significant capital expenditures, management resources and time.\nWe have limited experience in commercializing our products. For example, we have limited experience in building and managing a commercial team, conducting a comprehensive market analysis, and reimbursement, or managing distributors and a field force for our products. We compete with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded sales and marketing operations.\nFor commercialization of any or all of our product candidates, we will have to compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train and retain marketing and sales personnel. If we are unable to, or decide not to, further develop internal sales, marketing, and commercial distribution capabilities for any or all of our products, we will likely\npursue additional collaborative arrangements regarding the sales and marketing of our products. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain such collaborative arrangements, or if we are able to do so, that they will have effective sales forces. Any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties. We would have little or no control over the marketing and sales efforts of such third parties, and our revenue from product sales may be lower than if we had commercialized our products ourselves. We also face competition in our search for third parties to assist us with the sales and marketing efforts for our products.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to further develop or successfully maintain internal sales and commercial capabilities or establish or maintain relationships with third-party collaborators to successfully commercialize any product, and as a result, we may not be able to generate substantial product sales revenue.\nWe face significant competition and if our competitors continue to develop and market products that are more effective, safer or less expensive than our product and our product candidates, our current or future commercial opportunities may be negatively impacted.\nThe life sciences industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We are currently developing therapeutics that will compete with other drugs and therapies that currently exist or are being developed. Products we may develop in the future are also likely to face competition from other drugs and therapies, some of which we may not currently be aware. We have competitors both in the United States and internationally, including major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, drug development, technical and human resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical companies, in particular, have extensive experience in clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals, recruiting patients and manufacturing pharmaceutical products. These companies also have significantly greater research and marketing capabilities than we do and may also have products that have been approved or are in late stages of development, and collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research institutions. Established pharmaceutical companies may also invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license novel compounds that could make the product candidates that we develop obsolete. As a result of all of these factors, our competitors may succeed, or may have succeeded, in obtaining patent protection and/or FDA approval or discovering, developing and commercializing products in our field before we do.\nSpecifically, there are a large number of companies developing or marketing potential treatments for cancer, including many major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. These treatments consist both of small molecule drug products, as well as biologic therapeutics that work by using next-generation antibody technology platforms to address specific cancer targets. In addition, several companies are developing therapeutics that work by targeting multiple specificities using a single recombinant molecule. See \u201cCompetition\u201d above for additional information.\nOur commercial opportunity for MARGENZA is limited, and the commercial opportunity for future product candidates including MGC018 may be reduced or limited if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of biosimilar products.\nSmaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. In addition, the biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid technological change. If we fail to stay at the forefront of technological change, we may be unable to compete effectively. Technological advances or products developed by our competitors may render our technologies, products or product candidates obsolete, less competitive or not economical.\nActual or anticipated changes to the laws and regulations governing the health care system may have a negative impact on cost and access to health insurance coverage and reimbursement of healthcare items and services.\nThe United States and several foreign jurisdictions are considering, or have already enacted, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell any of our future approved products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs through lowering prescription drug prices, improving quality and/or expanding access to healthcare. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including the Patient\nProtection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the ACA), which became law in 2010. While it is difficult to assess the impact of the ACA in isolation, either in general or on our business specifically, it is widely thought that the ACA increases the likelihood of downward pressure on pharmaceutical reimbursement, which could negatively affect market acceptance of, and the price we may charge for, any products we develop that receive regulatory approval. Further, the United State and foreign governments regularly consider additional reform measures that affect healthcare coverage and costs. Such reforms may include changes to the coverage and reimbursement of healthcare services and products. In particular, there have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to the ACA, which could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare services covered by plans authorized by the ACA.\nWhile Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act) included a provision which repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d On June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business.\nFurther, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. For example, on November 20, 2020, the Centers for Medicare\u202f& Medicaid Services (CMS) issued an interim final rule implementing former President Trump\u2019s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. As a result of litigation challenging the Most Favored Nation model, on December 27, 2021, CMS published a final rule that rescinded the Most Favored Nation model interim final rule. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, \u201cPromoting Competition in the American Economy,\u201d with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden\u2019s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. However, it is unclear whether these or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe cannot predict what healthcare initiatives, if any, will be implemented at the federal or state level, however, government and other regulatory oversight and future regulatory and government interference with the healthcare systems could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any products that we develop, due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of various and evolving payor models and additional legislative proposals.\nReimbursement decisions by third-party payors may have an adverse effect on pricing and market acceptance. If there is not sufficient reimbursement for our products, it is less likely that our products will be widely used.\nMarket acceptance and sales of our products and product candidates, if approved for sale by the appropriate regulatory authorities, may depend on reimbursement policies and may be affected by future healthcare reform measures. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will reimburse and establish payment levels and, in some cases, utilization management strategies, such as tiered formularies and prior authorization. We cannot be certain that reimbursement will be available for our products or any products that we develop . Also, we cannot be certain that reimbursement policies will not reduce the demand for, or the price paid for, our products. Our ability to commercialize our products may depend, in part, on the extent to which reimbursement for the products will be available from government authorities and third-party payors. If reimbursement for our products is not\navailable or is available on a limited basis, or if the reimbursement amount for our products is inadequate to support a product\u2019s price, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any of our approved products.\nThere is uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, for example, principal decisions about reimbursement for new products are typically made by CMS, an agency within HHS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private third-party payors often follow CMS\u2019s decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement to a substantial degree. However, one third-party payor\u2019s determination to provide coverage for a product candidate does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product candidate. Further, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage and reimbursement determination process is often time-consuming and costly. This process may require us to provide scientific and clinical information to support the coverage or reimbursement of our products to each third-party payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.\nAs federal and state governments implement additional health care cost containment measures, including measures to lower prescription drug pricing, we cannot be sure that MARGENZA and our product candidates, if approved, will be covered, or remain covered, by private or public payors, and if covered, whether the reimbursement will be perceived by product purchasers as adequate. Health reform actions by federal and state governments and health plans may put additional downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and health care costs, which could negatively impact coverage and reimbursement for MARGENZA and our product candidates, if approved, our revenue, and our ability to compete with other marketed products and to recoup the costs of our research and development.\nIncreasingly, third-party payors are requiring that biopharmaceutical manufacturers provide them with discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, such payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of medical products . There may be especially significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products and product candidates on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of our products. Nonetheless, our products may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for any approved product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Further, coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. Additionally, we or our collaborators may develop companion diagnostic tests for use with our product candidates where appropriate. We or our collaborators will be required to obtain coverage and reimbursement for these tests separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement we may seek for our product candidates. While we have not yet developed any companion diagnostic tests for our product candidates, if we do, there is significant uncertainty regarding our ability to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for the same reasons applicable to our product candidates.\nIf any product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us or any of our collaborators, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products or product candidates.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability lawsuits related to the sale of our products to, use of our products by, and testing of our product candidates in, seriously ill patients. Product liability claims may be brought against us or our collaborators by participants enrolled in our clinical trials, patients, health care providers or others using, administering or selling any of our approved products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against any such claims, we may incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022decreased demand for our future approved products;\n\u2022injury to our reputation;\n\u2022withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022termination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n\u2022increased regulatory scrutiny;\n\u2022significant litigation costs;\n\u2022substantial monetary awards to or costly settlement with patients or other claimants;\n\u2022product recalls or a change in the indications for which they may be used;\n\u2022loss of revenue;\n\u2022diversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations; and\n\u2022the inability to commercialize our product candidates.\nWith respect to MGC018, MARGENZA and any of our other product candidates that are approved for commercial sale, we are, and will be, highly dependent upon physician and patient perceptions of us and the safety and quality of our products. We could be adversely affected if we are subject to negative publicity. We could also be adversely affected if any of our products or any similar products distributed by other companies prove to be, or are asserted to be, harmful to patients. Because of our dependence upon consumer perceptions, any adverse publicity associated with illness or other adverse effects resulting from patients\u2019 use or misuse of our products or any similar products distributed by other companies could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we hold $20 million in product liability insurance coverage in the aggregate, with a per incident limit of $20 million, which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We may need to increase our insurance coverage when we begin the commercialization of our product candidates. Insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive. As a result, we may be unable to maintain or obtain sufficient insurance at a reasonable cost to protect us against losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us, particularly if judgments exceed any insurance coverage we may have, could decrease our cash resources and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nEven if we and our collaborators obtain regulatory approvals to market our current and any future approved products, we and our collaborators will remain subject to extensive ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight, including post-approval requirements, that could result in significant additional expense and could negatively impact our and our collaborators' ability to commercialize our current and any future approved products.\nWe and our collaborators are subject to extensive ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review from applicable regulatory agencies with respect to any product obtaining regulatory approval, including MGC018 and MARGENZA, such as continued adverse event reporting requirements and post-marketing commitments, all of which may result in significant expense and limit our and our collaborators' ability to commercialize our current and any future approved products. For example, the FDA's approval of MARGENZA included a requirement that we provide to the FDA the data from the final overall survival endpoint from our SOPHIA study, which we reported in September 2021. Moreover, in connection with MARGENZA\u2019s approval, the labeling and advertising and promotion of MARGENZA are subject to additional regulatory requirements, which could entail significant expense and could negatively impact the potential commercialization of MARGENZA. To the extent other product candidates or those of our partners are approved by the FDA, we or our collaborators may be subject to similar post-marketing obligations.\nWe and the manufacturers of our current and any future approved products are also required, or will be required, to comply with cGMP regulations, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Further, regulatory agencies must approve these manufacturing facilities before they can be used to manufacture our products and product candidates, and these facilities are subject to ongoing regulatory inspections. In addition, regulatory agencies subject an approved product, its manufacturer and the manufacturer\u2019s facilities to continual review and inspections, including periodic unannounced inspections. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with our current or any future approved products, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facilities where our current or any future approved products are manufactured, may result in restrictions on the marketing of our current or any such future approved products, up to and including withdrawal of the affected product from the market. If our manufacturing facilities, our collaborators' manufacturing facilities, or those of our respective suppliers, fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, such noncompliance could result in regulatory action and additional costs to us.\nFailure to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:\n\u2022issuance of Form FDA 483 notices or Warning Letters by the FDA or other regulatory agencies;\n\u2022imposition of fines and other civil penalties;\n\u2022criminal prosecutions;\n\u2022injunctions, suspensions or revocations of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022suspension of any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022total or partial suspension of manufacturing;\n\u2022delays in commercialization;\n\u2022refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications submitted by us;\n\u2022refusals to permit drugs to be imported into or exported from the United States;\n\u2022restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; and\n\u2022product recalls or seizures.\nThe policies of the FDA and other regulatory agencies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of MGC018, our other product candidates or of MARGENZA in any additional indications or territories, or further restrict or regulate post-approval activities. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we or our collaborators might not be permitted to market our current or any future approved products and our business would suffer.\nWe and/or our collaboration partners may never obtain approval or commercialize our products outside of the United States, which would limit our ability to realize their full market potential.\nIn order to market any products outside of the United States, we and our current and potential collaboration partners must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. Approval procedures vary among countries and may require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials or additional administrative review periods, which could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us. In addition, our failure to obtain regulatory approval in any country may delay or have negative effects on the process for regulatory approval in other countries. Although we obtained FDA approval of MARGENZA in December 2020, we do not have any product candidates approved for sale in any international market. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our products will be harmed.\nInadequate funding for the FDA and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical FDA, and other government employees and pause or stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur contract with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)\u202fmakes us a government contractor. Laws and regulations affecting government contracts\u202fmay\u202fmake it more costly and difficult for us to successfully conduct our business.\u202f\nWe must comply with numerous laws and regulations relating to the procurement, formation, administration and performance of government contracts. Failure to comply with these laws could result in significant civil and criminal penalties.\nAmong the most significant government contracting regulations that may affect our business are: the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and NIH-NIAID-specific regulations supplemental to the FAR, which comprehensively regulate the procurement, formation, administration and performance of government contracts; business ethics and public integrity obligations, which govern conflicts of interest and the hiring of former government employees, restrict the granting of gratuities and funding of lobbying activities and incorporate other requirements such as the Anti-Kickback Act, the Procurement Integrity Act, and the False Claims Act; export and import control laws and regulations; and laws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of sensitive information we may receive pursuant to our performance of the government contract, and vaccination mandates. U.S. government agencies routinely audit and investigate government contractors for compliance with applicable laws and standards. If we are audited, such audit could result in disallowance of expected cost reimbursement, or if such audit were to uncover improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties, administrative sanctions, including suspension or debarment from government contracting and significant reputational harm.\nChanges in U.S. tax law may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and changes in international trade relations may have a material adverse effect on the commercialization of some or all of our product candidates.\nChanges in laws and policy relating to taxes may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Recent tax reforms in the United States have resulted in significant changes to preexisting U.S. tax rules and regulations. These changes may trigger an adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the U.S. government may seek to implement more protective trade measures with countries in which we plan to conduct business in, with great deal of uncertainty regarding trade policies, tariffs and government regulations, which if altered could have the potential to create a significant adverse effect on trade between the United States and other countries. Overall, changes in international trade relations, such as the imposition of or increase in tariffs or other trade barriers, could materially and adversely impact our costs, the ability to make sales of our product candidates to any of our significant customers in other countries, and reduce the competitiveness of our product candidates.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. Our first commercial product, MARGENZA, launched in March 2021 and to date has not resulted in revenues sufficient for us to reach profitability. Accordingly, we may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception. As of December\u202f31, 2021, our accumulated deficit was approximately $974 million. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to increase as we continue our research and development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, manufacture product and product candidate inventory, prepare for and begin to commercialize any future approved products, and add infrastructure and personnel if needed to support our product development efforts and operations as a public company. The net losses and negative cash flows incurred to date, together with expected future losses, have had, and likely will continue to have, an adverse effect on our stockholders' deficit and working capital. The amount of future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenue.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development and commercialization, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. For example, our expenses could increase if we are required by the FDA to perform trials in addition to those that we currently expect to perform, or if there are any delays in completing our currently planned clinical trials or in the development of any of our product candidates. Our expenses would significantly increase to the extent we build out a sales force and other commercially relevant functions to support the commercialization of any of our product candidates.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing and commercializing products with significant market potential. For example, revenues from MARGENZA are unlikely to be sufficient to enable us to reach profitability. In order to commercialize any additional product candidates, we will need to be successful in a range of challenging activities for which we are only in the preliminary stages, including developing product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for them, and manufacturing, marketing and selling approved products and product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. We may never succeed in these activities and may never generate revenue from product sales that is significant enough to achieve profitability. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our failure to become or remain profitable would depress our market value and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, develop other product candidates, or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nWe will require substantial additional funding, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, and, if not available, may require us to delay, scale back, or cease our product development programs or operations.\nWe are advancing our product candidates through clinical development and have commercialized MARGENZA in collaboration with Eversana. Developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is expensive. In order to obtain such regulatory approval of product candidates, we will be required to conduct clinical trials for each indication for each of our product candidates. We will continue to require additional funding beyond what was raised in our public offerings and through our collaborations and license agreements to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates and to continue to advance the development of our other product candidates, and such funding may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. Although it is difficult to predict our funding requirements, based upon our current operating plan, we anticipate that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2021, combined with anticipated and potential collaboration payments and product revenues, will enable us to fund our operations through 2023. Such guidance does not reflect anticipated expenditures related to the potential late-stage development of MGC018 in mCRPC or further expansion of studies currently ongoing. Because development of our product candidates is uncertain, we are unable to estimate accurately the actual funds we will require to complete research, development and clinical testing to commercialize our product candidates.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022the number and characteristics of other product candidates and indications that we pursue;\n\u2022the scope, progress, timing, cost and results of research, preclinical development, and clinical trials, in particular, our planned potential registrational path trial for MCG018;\n\u2022the costs, timing and outcome of seeking and obtaining FDA and non-U.S. regulatory approvals;\n\u2022the costs associated with manufacturing our product candidates;\n\u2022the costs of establishing sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities;\n\u2022our ability to maintain, expand, and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make in connection with the licensing, filing, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022our need and ability to hire additional management, scientific, and medical personnel;\n\u2022the effect of competing products that may limit market penetration of our product candidates;\n\u2022our need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems; and\n\u2022the economic and other terms, timing of and success of our existing collaborations, and any collaboration, licensing, or other arrangements into which we may enter in the future, including the timing of receipt of any milestone or royalty payments under these agreements.\nUntil we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements, which we may never do, we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, strategic collaborations, and grant funding. If sufficient funds on acceptable terms are not available when needed, or at all, we could be forced to significantly reduce operating expenses and delay, scale back or eliminate one or more of our development programs or our business operations.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish substantial rights.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these new securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing, if available at all, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, MARGENZA, product candidates, or future revenue streams, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional funding if and when necessary. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis, we could be required to delay, scale back or eliminate one or more of our development programs or grant rights to develop and market MARGENZA or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be limited.\nOur ability to utilize our federal net operating losses (NOLs) and federal tax credits is currently limited, and may be limited further, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The limitations apply if an ownership change, as defined by Section\u202f382, occurs. Generally, an ownership change occurs when certain shareholders increase their aggregate ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage in a testing period, which is typically three years or since the last ownership change. We are already subject to Section\u202f382 limitations due to acquisitions we made in 2002 and 2008.\u202fAs of December 31, 2021, we had federal and state NOL carryforwards of approximately $837 million and federal research and development tax credits of approximately $81 million available. Future changes in stock ownership may also trigger an ownership change and, consequently, another Section\u202f382 limitation. Any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of the net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards before utilization which would reduce our gross deferred income tax assets and corresponding valuation allowance. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards to reduce United States federal income tax may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future cash tax liability to us.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nOur existing therapeutic collaborations are important to our business, and future collaborations may also be important to us. If we are unable to maintain any of these collaborations, or if these collaborations are not successful, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe have limited capabilities for drug development and have little to no internal capability for sales, marketing or distribution. We have entered into collaborations with other companies that we believe can provide such capabilities, including our agreements with, for example, Incyte Corporation, Zai Lab Limited, I-Mab Biopharma and Janssen Biotech, Inc. These current collaborations also have provided us with important funding for our development programs and technology platforms and we expect to receive additional funding under these collaborations in the future. Our existing therapeutic collaborations, and any future collaborations we enter into, may pose a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u2022collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u2022collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of any product candidates that achieve regulatory approval or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators' strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities;\n\u2022collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u2022product candidates discovered in collaboration with us may be viewed by our collaborators as competitive with their own product candidates or products, which may cause collaborators to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u2022a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our product candidates that achieve regulatory approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products;\n\u2022disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;\n\u2022collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u2022collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability; and\n\u2022collaborations may be terminated for the convenience of the collaborator and, if terminated, we could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates. For example, each of our collaboration and license agreements may be terminated for convenience upon the completion of a specified notice period.\nIf our therapeutic collaborations do not result in the successful development and commercialization of products or if one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may not receive any future research funding or milestone or royalty payments under the collaboration. All of the risks relating to product development, regulatory approval and commercialization described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K also apply to the activities of our program collaborators.\nAdditionally, subject to its contractual obligations to us, if one of our collaborators is involved in a business combination, the collaborator might de-emphasize or terminate the development or commercialization of MARGENZA or any product candidate licensed to it by us. If one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to attract new collaborators.\nFor MGC018 and our other product candidates, we may in the future determine to collaborate with additional pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for development and potential commercialization. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. These factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge and industry and market conditions generally. The collaborator may also consider alternative products, product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate.\nCollaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators. If we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to curtail the development of MGC018 or our other product candidates, reduce or delay one or more of our other development programs, delay the commercialization of a product candidate or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to enter into collaborations and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development and commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop MGC018 or our other product candidates or bring them to market or continue to develop our technology platforms and our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may also be restricted under collaboration agreements from entering into additional agreements on certain terms with potential collaborators. Most of our existing therapeutic collaborations contain a restriction on our engaging in activities that are the subject of the collaboration with third parties for specified periods of time.\nIndependent clinical investigators and CROs that we engage to conduct our clinical trials may not devote sufficient time or attention to our clinical trials or be able to repeat their past success.\nWe expect to continue to depend on independent clinical investigators and CROs to conduct our clinical trials, including future trials for MGC018 and other product candidates. CROs may also assist us in the collection and analysis of data. There is a limited number of third-party service providers that specialize or have the expertise required to achieve our business objectives. Identifying, qualifying and managing performance of third-party service providers can be difficult, time consuming and cause delays in our development programs. These investigators and CROs will not be our employees and we will not be able to control, other than by contract, the amount of resources, including time, which they devote to our product candidates and clinical trials. If independent investigators or CROs fail to devote sufficient resources to the development of our\nproduct candidates, or if their performance is substandard, it may delay or compromise the prospects for approval and commercialization of any product candidates that we develop. In addition, the use of third-party service providers requires us to disclose our proprietary information to these parties, which could increase the risk that this information will be misappropriated. Further, the FDA requires that we comply with standards, commonly referred to as current Good Clinical Practice (GCP) for conducting, recording and reporting clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial subjects are protected. Failure of clinical investigators or CROs to meet their obligations to us or comply with GCP procedures could adversely affect the clinical development of our product candidates and harm our business.\nFailure to successfully develop and commercialize companion diagnostics with third party contractors for use with our product candidates could harm our ability to commercialize our product candidates.\nWe plan to develop, or engage third parties to develop, companion diagnostics for our product candidates where appropriate. At least in some cases, the FDA and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States may request or require the development and regulatory approval of a companion diagnostic as a condition to approving one or more of our product candidates. We do not have experience or capabilities in developing or commercializing diagnostics and are relying, and in the future plan to continue to rely, in large part on third parties to perform these functions.\nIn most cases, we will likely outsource the development, production and commercialization of companion diagnostics to third parties. By outsourcing these companion diagnostics to third parties, we become dependent on the efforts of our third party contractors to successfully develop and commercialize these companion diagnostics. Our contractors:\n\u2022may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u2022may encounter production difficulties that could constrain the supply of the companion diagnostic;\n\u2022may have difficulties gaining acceptance of the use of the companion diagnostic in the clinical community;\n\u2022may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product; and\n\u2022may terminate their relationship with us.\nIf any companion diagnostic for use with one of our product candidates fails to gain market acceptance, our ability to derive revenues from sales of such product candidate could be harmed. If our third party contractors fail to commercialize such companion diagnostic, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with another diagnostic company to obtain supplies of an alternative diagnostic test for use in connection with such product candidate or do so on commercially reasonable terms, which could adversely affect and delay the development or commercialization of such product candidate.\nWe contract with, and may in the future contract with, third parties for components of the manufacturing of MARGENZA and our other product candidates. Failure of third-party contractors to successfully perform their obligations could harm our ability to develop or commercialize our product or product candidates.\nWe currently have two cGMP manufacturing facilities located in Rockville, Maryland in compliance with cGMP to support future clinical and commercial production of our and our collaborators\u2019 product candidates. We manufacture drug substance lots at these facilities that we use for clinical trials of our and our collaborators\u2019 product candidates. We also manufacture commercial supply of MARGENZA. Although we believe we currently have capacity to produce most of the material required for our and our collaborators\u2019 clinical trials and for the commercial supply of MARGENZA, we may not be able to do so in the future, and may continue to rely on arrangements with third parties. We will continue to rely on third parties for bioconjugation to produce ADCs and for fill finish activities, neither of which our cGMP manufacturing facilities can currently accommodate.\nWe have entered into agreements with contract manufacturing organizations in the past to supplement our clinical supply and internal capacity as we commercialize MARGENZA and advance MGC018 and other product candidates in our pipeline. Current MARGENZA inventory was manufactured by a third party. In the future, we plan to manufacture MARGENZA utilizing our internal facility. In addition, in the future, we may use third parties for the manufacture of some or all components of our product candidates for clinical testing, including anti-body drug conjugates, as well as for commercial manufacture of some of our product candidates that receive marketing approval and that are not manufactured by us or one of our third party collaborators.. We may be unable to reach agreement with any of these contract manufacturers, or to identify and reach arrangements on satisfactory terms with other contract manufacturers, to manufacture any of our product candidates. Additionally, the facilities used by any contract manufacturer to manufacture any of our product candidates must be the subject of a satisfactory inspection before the FDA and other regulatory authorities approve a BLA or marketing authorization for the product candidate manufactured at that facility. We will depend on these third-party manufacturing partners for compliance\nwith the FDA\u2019s requirements for the manufacture of our finished products. If our manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the FDA and other regulatory authorities\u2019 cGMP requirements, our product candidates will not be approved or, if already approved, may be subject to recalls.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured MARGENZA or the product candidates ourselves, including:\n\u2022the possibility of a breach of the manufacturing agreements by the third parties because of factors beyond our control;\n\u2022the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreements by the third parties before we are able to arrange for a qualified replacement third-party manufacturer; and\n\u2022the possibility that we may not be able to secure a manufacturer or manufacturing capacity in a timely manner and on satisfactory terms in order to meet our manufacturing needs.\nAny of these factors could cause adversely impact the commercialization of MARGENZA and the delay of approval or commercialization of our product candidates, cause us to incur higher costs or prevent us from commercializing our product candidates successfully. Furthermore, if contract manufacturers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of finished product on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, and we are unable to find one or more replacement manufacturers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, in substantially equivalent volumes and quality and on a timely basis, we would likely be unable to meet demand for our products and could lose potential revenue. It may take several years to establish an alternative source of supply for MARGENZA or our product candidates and to have any such new source approved by the FDA or any other relevant regulatory authorities.\nCommercialization collaborations will be important to our business. If we are unable to maintain commercialization collaborations, or if commercialization collaborations are not successful, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe have limited capabilities for drug commercialization, with little to no internal capability for sales, marketing or distribution. For example, we have entered into a collaboration with Eversana for the commercialization of MARGENZA in the United States that we believe can provide such capabilities, and may enter into commercial collaborations in the future for MARGENZA or our product candidates. Our existing commercialization collaboration, and any future commercialization collaborations we enter into, may pose a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022collaborators may have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u2022collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u2022collaborators may not pursue commercialization of MARGENZA or any product candidates that achieve regulatory approval or may elect not to continue commercialization based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators' strategic focus or other factors that divert resources or create competing priorities;\n\u2022collaborators could independently commercialize products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u2022collaborators with marketing and distribution rights to MARGENZA or our product candidates that achieve regulatory approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products;\n\u2022disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements on contract interpretation, commercialization strategy or tactics, might cause delays or termination of the commercialization of MARGENZA or product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to MARGENZA or product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;\n\u2022collaborators may not properly utilize our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u2022collaborators may violate, or be investigated for potentially violating, health care compliance and related laws and regulations, which may expose us to litigation, enforcement actions or inquiries, or other potential liability; and\n\u2022collaborations may be terminated for the convenience of the collaborator and, if terminated, we could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further commercialization of MARGNEZA or applicable product candidates.\nAll of the risks relating to commercialization, and health care legal compliance described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K also apply to the commercialization activities of our collaborators.\nAdditionally, subject to its contractual obligations to us, if one of our collaborators is involved in a business combination, the collaborator might de-emphasize or terminate the development or commercialization of MARGENZA or any product candidate licensed to it by us. If one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to attract new collaborators. We may also be restricted under commercialization collaboration agreements from entering into future agreements on certain terms with potential collaborators. For example, our collaboration with Eversana contains a restriction on our engaging in activities that are the subject of the collaboration with third parties for specified periods of time among other conditions\nCommercialization collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators. If we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to curtail the commercialization of MARGENZA or a product candidate, reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake or commercialization activities at our own expense. If in the future we elect to fund and undertake commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to enter into collaborations to commercialize our product candidates and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary commercialization activities, we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates or bring them to market or continue and our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity\nA disruption in our computer networks, including those related to cybersecurity, could adversely affect our financial performance as well as our research, development and commercialization efforts.\nSecurity breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches continue to increase generally and can create system disruptions or shutdowns or the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, due to the COVID-19 pandemic a significant portion of our employees have been working remotely, either from home or elsewhere. If personal information or protected health information is improperly accessed, tampered with or disclosed as a result of a security breach, we may incur significant costs to notify and mitigate potential harm to the affected individuals, and we may be subject to sanctions and civil or criminal penalties if we are found to be in violation of federal, state, or other laws protecting confidential personal information. In addition, a cybersecurity breach could hurt our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties for compromised personal information and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In order to reduce such risks, our information security program employs a policy-driven information systems security architecture based on National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework and references the NIST 800-53 guidelines for risk-based assessments and implementation of information security controls. The program is managed by dedicated Information Security personnel with the primary mission to implement, maintain, and improve the capabilities and practices to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the sensitive information it maintains. \u202f\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the valid patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Other entities may have or obtain patents or proprietary rights that could limit our ability to make, use, sell, offer for sale or import our future approved products or impair our competitive position. For example, certain patents held by third parties cover Fc engineering methods and mutations in Fc regions to enhance the binding of Fc regions to Fc receptors on immune cells. Although we believe that these patents are not infringed, and/or are invalid and/or unenforceable, if a court should find that they cover MARGENZA or enoblituzumab and we are unable to invalidate such patents, or if licenses for them are not available on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be harmed, perhaps materially.\nPatents that we may ultimately be found to infringe could be issued to third parties. Third parties may have or obtain valid and enforceable patents or proprietary rights that could block us from developing product candidates using our technology. Our failure to obtain a license to any technology that we require may materially harm our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations. Moreover, our failure to maintain a license to any technology that we require may also materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, we would be exposed to a threat of litigation.\nIn the pharmaceutical industry, significant litigation and other proceedings regarding patents, patent applications, trademarks and other intellectual property rights have become commonplace. The types of situations in which we may become a party to such litigation or proceedings include:\n\u2022we or our collaborators may initiate litigation or other proceedings against third parties seeking to invalidate the patents held by those third parties or to obtain a judgment that our products or processes do not infringe those third parties' patents;\n\u2022if our competitors file patent applications that claim technology also claimed by us or our licensors, we or our licensors may be required to participate in interference, opposition or other proceedings to determine the priority of invention, which could jeopardize our patent rights and potentially provide a third party with a dominant patent position;\n\u2022if third parties initiate litigation claiming that our processes or products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights, we and our collaborators will need to defend against such proceedings; and\n\u2022if a license to necessary technology is terminated, the licensor may initiate litigation claiming that our processes or products infringe or misappropriate their patent or other intellectual property rights and/or that we breached our obligations under the license agreement, and we and our collaborators would need to defend against such proceedings.\nThese lawsuits would be costly and could affect our results of operations and divert the attention of our management and scientific personnel. There is a risk that a court would decide that we or our collaborators are infringing the third party\u2019s patents and would order us or our collaborators to stop the activities covered by the patents. In that event, we or our collaborators may not have a viable alternative to the technology protected by the patent and may need to halt work on the affected product candidate or cease commercialization of an approved product. In addition, there is a risk that a court will order us or our collaborators to pay the other party damages. An adverse outcome in any litigation or other proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and require us to cease using the technology that is at issue or to license the technology from third parties. We may not be able to obtain any required licenses on commercially acceptable terms or at all. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have produced a significant number of patents, and it may not always be clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform or predictable. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products or methods either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity is difficult. For example, in the United States, proving invalidity requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents. Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and divert management\u2019s time and attention in pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on us. If we are unable to avoid infringing the patent rights of others, we may be required to seek a license, defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of the patents in court. Patent litigation is costly and time consuming. We may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion. In addition, if we do not obtain a license, develop or obtain non-infringing technology, fail to defend an infringement action successfully or have infringed patents declared invalid, we may incur substantial monetary damages, encounter significant delays in bringing our product candidates to market and be precluded from manufacturing or selling our product candidates.\nThe cost of any patent litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the cost of such litigation and proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time.\nIf we are unable to obtain and enforce patent protection for our products and our product candidates and related technology, our business could be materially harmed.\nIssued patents may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, court decisions may introduce uncertainty in the enforceability or scope of patents owned by biotechnology companies. The legal systems of certain countries\ndo not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents, and the laws of foreign countries may not allow us to protect our inventions with patents to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Because patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all, and because publications of discoveries in scientific literature lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our issued patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for protection of the inventions set forth in our patents or patent applications. As a result, we may not be able to obtain or maintain protection for certain inventions. Therefore, the enforceability and scope of our patents in the United States and in foreign countries cannot be predicted with certainty and, as a result, any patents that we own or license may not provide sufficient protection against competitors. We may not be able to obtain or maintain patent protection from our pending patent applications, from those we may file in the future, or from those we may license from third parties. Moreover, even if we are able to obtain patent protection, such patent protection may be of insufficient scope to achieve our business objectives.\nOur strategy depends on our ability to identify and seek patent protection for our discoveries. This process is expensive and time consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner or in all jurisdictions where protection may be commercially advantageous. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may be able to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.\nThe issuance of a patent does not ensure that a court or agency finds or will find the patent valid or enforceable, so even if we obtain patents, they may not be valid or enforceable against third parties. In addition, the issuance of a patent does not give us the right to practice the patented invention. Third parties may have blocking patents that could prevent us from marketing our own patented product and practicing our own patented technology. Third parties may also seek to market biosimilar versions of any approved products. Alternatively, third parties may seek approval to market their own products similar to or otherwise competitive with our products. In these circumstances, we may need to defend and/or assert our patents, including by filing lawsuits alleging patent infringement. In any of these types of proceedings, a court or agency with jurisdiction may find our patents invalid and/or unenforceable. Even if we have valid and enforceable patents, these patents still may not provide protection against competing products or processes sufficient to achieve our business objectives.\nThe patent position of pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, including ours, is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual considerations. The standards which the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and its foreign counterparts use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. There is also no uniform, worldwide policy regarding the subject matter and scope of claims granted or allowable in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary information to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many companies have encountered significant problems and costs in protecting their proprietary information in these foreign countries. Outside the United States, patent protection must be sought in individual jurisdictions, further adding to the cost and uncertainty of obtaining adequate patent protection outside of the United States. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether additional patents protecting our technology will issue in the United States or in foreign jurisdictions, or whether any patents that do issue will have claims of adequate scope to provide competitive advantage. Moreover, we cannot predict whether third parties will be able to successfully obtain claims or the breadth of such claims. The allowance of broader claims may increase the incidence and cost of patent interference proceedings, opposition proceedings, and/or reexamination proceedings, the risk of infringement litigation, and the vulnerability of the claims to challenge. On the other hand, the allowance of narrower claims does not eliminate the potential for adversarial proceedings, and may fail to provide a competitive advantage. Our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products, or provide us with any competitive advantage.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nEven after they have been issued, our patents and any patents which we license may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented. If our patents are invalidated or otherwise limited or will expire prior to the commercialization of our approved products and product candidates, other companies may be better able to develop products that compete with ours, which could adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and financial condition.\nThe following are examples of litigation and other adversarial proceedings or disputes that we could become a party to involving our patents or patents licensed to us:\n\u2022we or our collaborators may initiate litigation or other proceedings against third parties to enforce our patent rights;\n\u2022third parties may initiate litigation or other proceedings seeking to invalidate patents owned by or licensed to us or to obtain a declaratory judgment that their product or technology does not infringe our patents or patents licensed to us;\n\u2022third parties may initiate opposition, reexamination or inter partes review proceedings challenging the validity or scope of our patent rights, requiring us or our collaborators and/or licensors to participate in such proceedings to defend the validity and scope of our patents;\n\u2022there may be a challenge or dispute regarding inventorship or ownership of patents currently identified as being owned by or licensed to us;\n\u2022the USPTO may initiate an interference between patents or patent applications owned by or licensed to us and those of our competitors, requiring us or our collaborators and/or licensors to participate in an interference proceeding to determine the priority of invention, which could jeopardize our patent rights; or\n\u2022third parties may seek approval to market biosimilar versions of our future approved products prior to expiration of relevant patents owned by or licensed to us, requiring us to defend our patents, including by filing lawsuits alleging patent infringement.\nThese lawsuits and proceedings would be costly and could affect our results of operations and divert the attention of our managerial and scientific personnel. There is a risk that a court or administrative body would decide that our patents are invalid or not infringed by a third party\u2019s activities, or that the scope of certain issued claims must be further limited. An adverse outcome in a litigation or proceeding involving our own patents could limit our ability to assert our patents against these or other competitors, affect our ability to receive royalties or other licensing consideration from our licensees, and may curtail or preclude our ability to exclude third parties from making, using and selling similar or competitive products. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and financial condition.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u2022others may be able to develop a platform that is similar to, or better than, ours in a way that is not covered by the claims of our patents;\n\u2022others may be able to make compounds that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of our patents;\n\u2022we might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by patents or pending patent applications;\n\u2022we might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022any patents that we obtain may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may ultimately be found invalid or unenforceable; or\n\u2022we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under our intellectual property licenses with third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe are currently party to various intellectual property license agreements. These license agreements impose, and we expect that future license agreements may impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. For example, we have entered into patent and know-how license agreements that grant us the right to use certain technologies related to biological manufacturing to manufacture our clinical product candidates. These licenses typically include an obligation to pay yearly maintenance payments and royalties on sales, and may also include upfront and milestone payments. If we fail to comply with our obligations under the licenses, the licensors may have the right to terminate their respective license agreements, in which event we might not be able to market any product that is covered by the agreements. Termination of the license agreements or reduction or elimination of our licensed rights may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses with less favorable terms, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to patent protection, we also rely on other proprietary rights, including protection of trade secrets, and other proprietary information. To maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information, we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, collaborators and others upon the commencement of their relationships with us. These agreements require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to\nthe individual by us during the course of the individual\u2019s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. Our agreements with employees and our personnel policies also provide that any inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us shall be our exclusive property. However, we may not obtain these agreements in all circumstances, and individuals with whom we have these agreements may not comply with their terms. Thus, despite such agreement, such inventions may become assigned to third parties. In the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or proprietary information, these agreements, even if obtained, may not provide meaningful protection, particularly for our trade secrets or other confidential information. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use technology or know-how owned by third parties in their work for us, disputes may arise between us and those third parties as to the rights in related inventions. To the extent that an individual who is not obligated to assign rights in intellectual property to us is rightfully an inventor of intellectual property, we may need to obtain an assignment or a license to that intellectual property from that individual, or a third party or from that individual\u2019s assignee. Such assignment or license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nAdequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary information. The disclosure of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and may materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position. In addition, others may independently discover or develop our trade secrets and proprietary information, and the existence of our own trade secrets affords no protection against such independent discovery.\nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, we employ individuals who were previously or concurrently employed at research institutions and/or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may be subject to claims that these employees, or we, have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers, or that patents and applications we have filed to protect inventions of these employees, even those related to one or more of our product candidates, are rightfully owned by their former or concurrent employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, documentary, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to the USPTO and various foreign patent offices at various points over the lifetime of our patents and/or applications. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we rely on our outside counsel or our agents to pay these fees when due. Additionally, the USPTO and various foreign patent offices require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with rules applicable to the particular jurisdiction. However, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If such an event were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we may be responsible for the payment of patent fees for patent rights that we license from other parties. If any licensor of these patents does not itself elect to make these payments, and we fail to do so, we may be liable to the licensor for any costs and consequences of any resulting loss of patent rights.\nIf we do not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and similar foreign legislation for extending the term of patents covering each of our product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and conditions of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years for a patent covering an approved product as compensation for effective patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, we may not receive an extension if we fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we can enforce our patent rights for that product will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval to market competing products sooner. As a result, our revenue from applicable products could be reduced, possibly materially,\nRisks Related to Legal Compliance Matters\nIf we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur research and development involves, and may in the future involve, the use of potentially hazardous materials and chemicals. Our operations may produce hazardous waste products. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards mandated by local, state and federal laws and regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. If an accident occurs, we could be held liable for resulting damages, which could be substantial. We are also subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations and fire and building codes, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens, use and storage of flammable agents and the handling of biohazardous materials. Although we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance as prescribed by the States of Maryland and California to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of these materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us. Additional federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our operations may be adopted in the future. We may incur substantial costs to comply with, and substantial fines or penalties if we violate, any of these laws or regulations.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, (FCPA) and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where we do business. The FCPA and these other laws generally prohibit us and our employees and intermediaries from bribing, being bribed or making other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. We and our commercial partners operate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a risk of potential FCPA violations, and we participate in collaborations and relationships with third parties whose actions could potentially subject us to liability under the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws. There is no assurance that we will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws. If we violate provisions of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws or are subject to an investigation or audit pursuant to these laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and our collaborators are subject to various healthcare laws, and our failure, or the failure of our collaborators, to comply with those laws could result in significant penalties and adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.\nIn the United States, our operations, and those of our collaborators, are subject to regulation by various local, state, federal authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, CMS, other divisions of HHS (such as the Office of Inspector General, Office for Civil Rights and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. We and our collaborators are or may be subject to broadly applicable \u201cfraud and abuse\u201d laws, such as false claims, anti-kickback laws, transparency laws, and privacy and security laws. Federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a claim paid.\nThe federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are several statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal anti-kickback statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices, or those of our collaborators, may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor.\nAdditionally, the intent standard under the federal anti-kickback statute and the criminal healthcare fraud statutes (discussed below) was amended by the ACA to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified\ncase law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil false claims act.\nThe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private), willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal anti-kickback statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.\nIn addition, under the Sunshine Act provisions of the ACA, covered manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under a federal health care program (with certain exceptions) are subject to annual federal reporting and disclosure requirements with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals as well as information regarding certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.\nMost states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and federal false claims laws, which may apply to items such as pharmaceutical products and services reimbursed by private insurers. Some state laws also prohibit certain gifts to healthcare providers, require pharmaceutical companies to report payments to healthcare professionals, and/or require companies to adopt compliance programs or codes of conduct.\nOver the past few years, a number of pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of promotional and marketing activities, such as: providing free trips, free goods, improper consulting fees and grants and other monetary benefits to prescribers; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in off-label promotion; and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid Rebate Program to reduce liability for Medicaid rebates. At such time as we or our collaborators market MARGENZA or any of our future approved products and these products are paid for by governmental programs, it is possible that some of our business activities could also be subject to challenge under one or more of these \u201cfraud and abuse\u201d laws.\nWe and our collaborators may also be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business, as well as foreign jurisdictions. In the United States, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) and its implementing regulations, impose requirements on \u201ccovered entities,\u201d including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, and their respective \u201cbusiness associates\u201d that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity as well as their covered subcontractors relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. We are subject to other state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR) which went into effect on May 25, 2018, imposes privacy and security obligations on any entity that collects and/or processes health data from individuals located in the European Union. Under the GDPR, fines of up to 20 million Euros or up to 4% of the annual global turnover of the infringer, whichever is greater, could be imposed for significant non-compliance. In addition, on June 28, 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent state privacy legislation in the United States, which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business. As well as complicating our compliance efforts, non-compliance with these laws could result in penalties or significant legal liability.\nFurther, in order to distribute products commercially in the United States, we or our collaborators must also comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers, and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to\nadopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, track, and report gifts, compensation and other remuneration made to physicians and other healthcare providers, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices.\nIf our operations, or those of our collaborators marketing, distributing or commercializing any of our products on our behalf, are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, significant civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private \u201cqui tam\u201d actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nIn addition, our operations and those of our collaborators may be subject to analogous foreign health care laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, to provide accurate information to the FDA or other agencies, to comply with federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations, to report financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the health care industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a code of conduct, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nRisks Relating to Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the research and development, clinical and business development expertise of Scott Koenig, M.D., Ph.D., our President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as the other members of our senior management team. Although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers, each of them may terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our research, development, manufacturing and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing and other personnel will also be critical to our success. For example, we have experienced increased employee turnover, consistent with high numbers of employee resignations across the broader American economy, and we may continue to experience employee turnover in the future that may have an adverse effect on our business strategy. New hires require significant training and, in most cases, take significant time before they achieve full productivity. New employees may not become as productive as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals. In addition, the foregoing may be exacerbated by employees unwilling to work due to choosing not to comply with vaccine mandates for healthcare workers or for government contractors. Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. Such competition may increase due to the recent move by companies to offer a remote or hybrid work environment. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific\nand clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, motivate existing employees, or maintain our corporate culture in a hybrid or remote work environment and in the midst of higher turnover, our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited.\nIf we are unable to provide meaningful equity incentives to our key employees, it could adversely affect our ability to retain these key employees, which in turn could affect our ability to implement our business strategies.\nWe are dependent upon the members of our senior management team and other key employees. In our industry, it is common to attract and retain executive and other key employees with compensation packages that include a significant equity component. As a result, we may have difficulty retaining key personnel, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to execute our business strategy.\nWe may need to grow our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 427 full-time employees. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, we may choose to expand our employee base for managerial, operational, manufacturing, sales, marketing, financial and other resources. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of their attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational errors, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Any such growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the commercialization of MARGENZA and the development of existing and additional product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage such growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate and/or grow revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize MARGENZA, our product candidates and compete effectively with others in our industry will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any such growth.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nWe are subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention and adversely impact our business.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. Companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their common stock are often subject to securities class action litigation. For example, on September 13, 2019, a securities class action complaint was filed against us, and certain of our officers and/or directors in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. On September 29, 2021, the District Court issued an Order dismissing the case, with prejudice. On October 28, 2021 the Lead Plaintiff filed a Notice of Appeal, and on January 18, 2022 the Lead Plaintiff filed its opening brief. The case is now pending in the Fourth Circuit. This or any future securities litigation brought by private parties or government enforcement agencies could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely impact our business. Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.\nThe market price of our stock may fluctuate unpredictably in response to factors unrelated to our operating performance. The stock market has recently experienced significant volatility, particularly with respect to pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other life sciences company stocks. The volatility of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other life sciences company stocks often does not relate to the operating performance of the companies represented by the stock. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022results and timing of our clinical trials and clinical trials of our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022failure or discontinuation of any of our development programs;\n\u2022issues in manufacturing our product candidates or future approved products;\n\u2022regulatory developments or enforcement in the United States and foreign countries with respect to our product candidates or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022competition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n\u2022developments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022introduction of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022announcements by us, our collaborators or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u2022changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if any cover our common stock;\n\u2022fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022public concern over our product candidates or any future approved products;\n\u2022threatened or actual litigation;\n\u2022future or anticipated sales of our common stock;\n\u2022share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022changes in the structure of health care payment systems in the United States or overseas;\n\u2022failure of any of MARGENZA or our product candidates, if approved, to achieve commercial success;\n\u2022economic and other external factors or other disasters or crises;\n\u2022period-to-period fluctuations in our financial condition and results of operations, including the timing of receipt of any milestone or other payments under commercialization or licensing agreements;\n\u2022general market conditions and market conditions for biopharmaceutical stocks;\n\u2022overall fluctuations in U.S. equity markets; and\n\u2022impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as mandatory and voluntary actions taken to mitigate the evolving public health impact of the pandemic.\nIn addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. For example, we currently have one such securities class action lawsuit brought against us. We could incur substantial costs defending this or similar lawsuits, as well as diversion of the time and attention of our management, any or all of which could seriously harm our business\nProvisions of our charter, bylaws, third-party agreements and Delaware law may make an acquisition of us or a change in our management more difficult.\nCertain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, acquisition, or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. Stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so. Furthermore, since our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. These provisions:\n\u2022allow the authorized number of directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u2022establish a classified board of directors, providing that not all members of the board of directors be elected at one time;\n\u2022authorize our board of directors to issue without stockholder approval blank check preferred stock that, if issued, could operate as a \"poison pill\" to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that is not approved by our board of directors;\n\u2022require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022establish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to our board of directors or for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022limit who may call stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022require the approval of the holders of 75% of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote in order to amend certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws.\nFurthermore, in the ordinary course of our business, from time to time we discuss and enter into collaborations, licenses and other transactions with various third parties, including other pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies. When we deem it appropriate, our agreements with such third parties may include standstill provisions. These standstill provisions, several of which may be in force from time-to-time, typically prohibit such parties from acquiring our securities for a period of time, which may discourage such parties from acquiring MacroGenics even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section\u202f203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may, unless certain criteria are met, prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a prescribed period of time. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 14257, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "MGNX"}
