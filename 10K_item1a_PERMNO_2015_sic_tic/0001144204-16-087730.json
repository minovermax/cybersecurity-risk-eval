Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. You should also refer to the other information in this report, including our financial statements and the related notes incorporated by reference. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer. In that event the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur ability to continue as a going concern may require that we raise additional funds no later than the first quarter of 2017, without which we may need to cease our business operations and begin liquidation proceedings.\nBased upon our current expense and revenue assumptions, we anticipate that we will need to obtain additional financing no later than the first quarter of 2017. If our expenses are greater than expected or our clinical trials take longer than expected, we may be required to raise additional funds prior to that time. We will continue to explore various financing alternatives to address our liquidity needs. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in obtaining additional financing on acceptable terms or at all. We anticipate that if we are able to secure additional financing, that such financing could result in significant dilution of the ownership interests of our stockholders and may provide certain rights to the new investors senior to the rights of our current stockholders, including but not limited to, voting rights and rights to proceeds in the event of a sale or liquidation of the Company. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we may never achieve or sustain profitability. In the event that we are unable to obtain adequate financing to conduct operations, we may need to cease our business operations and begin liquidation proceedings. If we need to liquidate our assets, we would likely realize significantly less from them than the values at which they are carried on our financial statements.\nIf we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations when needed, we may have to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or commercialization efforts, dispose of assets or liquidate.\nWe expect to make additional capital outlays and to increase operating expenditures over the next several years to support our preclinical development and clinical trial activities, particularly with respect to ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials for Proellex\u00ae. On February 2, 2015, we announced that we submitted the NDA for our enclomiphene product candidate to the FDA. The FDA accepted the NDA for review on April 1, 2015 and later assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of November 30, 2015. In addition, the Division of Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Products (the Division) of the FDA scheduled an advisory committee meeting to review the NDA for November 3, 2015. However, the Division subsequently cancelled the scheduled advisory committee meeting due to questions that arose late in the review regarding the bioanalytical method validation that could affect interpretability of certain pivotal study data. On December 1, 2015, we announced that we had received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA. A CRL informs companies that an NDA cannot be approved in its present form. In the CRL, the FDA stated that, based on recent scientific developments, the design of the enclomiphene Phase 3 studies is no longer adequate to demonstrate clinical benefit and recommended that Repros conduct an additional Phase 3 study or studies to support approval in the target population. The FDA also noted concerns regarding study entry criteria, titration and bioanalytical method validation in the Phase 3 program. Subsequently, on February 4, 2016, the Company attended a meeting with the FDA reviewers and senior leaders to discuss resolution of issues identified during the NDA review. The meeting covered a broad range of topics surrounding the NDA data as well as emerging agency and expert thinking regarding the treatment of hypogonadism.\nAs a result of these events, the Company plans to focus its resources on the Phase 2B studies for Proellex\u00ae for the treatment of uterine fibroids, the Phase 2 study for Proellex\u00ae for the treatment of endometriosis and the Phase 2 study for enclomiphene for the treatment of secondary hypogonadism. Based on our current and planned clinical programs, we anticipate that our current liquidity will be sufficient to continue the development of our product candidates into the first quarter of 2017. However, it is possible that our clinical trial activities will be more costly and take longer than we anticipate; accordingly, there can be no assurance that additional capital will not be necessary prior to the time anticipated. In the normal course of business we continue to explore possible partnerships with various pharmaceutical companies. If in the future we fail to reach or elect not to enter into an arrangement with a collaborative partner with respect to the sales and marketing of any of our product candidates, we would need to develop a sales and marketing organization with supporting distribution capability in order to market such products directly. Significant additional expenditures would be required for us to develop such a sales and marketing organization. We may continue to seek additional funding through public or private financings, including equity or debt financings, and/or through other means, including collaborations and license agreements, as appropriate. We do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed, or that, if available, we will obtain financing on terms favorable to our stockholders or us. We anticipate that if we are able to secure additional financing, that such financing will result in significant dilution of the ownership interests of our stockholders and may provide certain rights to the new investors senior to the rights of our current stockholders, including but not limited to, voting rights and rights to proceeds in the event of a sale or liquidation of the Company. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we may never achieve or sustain profitability. In the event that we are unable to obtain adequate financing to conduct operations, we may need to cease our business operations and begin liquidation proceedings. If we need to liquidate our assets, we would likely realize significantly less from them than the values at which they are carried on our financial statements. The funds resulting from the liquidation of our assets would be used first to pay off the debt owed to any secured and unsecured creditors before any funds would be available to pay our stockholders, and any shortfall in the proceeds would directly reduce the amounts available for distribution, if any, to our creditors and to our stockholders. In the event we were required to liquidate, it is highly unlikely that stockholders would receive any value for their shares.\nIn recent years, the general economic and capital market conditions in the United States have varied significantly and have increased the cost of capital in many circumstances, and there is no certainty that economic conditions will permit us to raise capital in an amount to sufficiently fund our long-term plans, in 2016 or beyond. If economic conditions become worse, our future cost of equity or debt capital and access to the capital markets could be adversely affected. If we cannot raise adequate funds, we may be required to:\n\u2022 delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our development programs;\n\u2022 relinquish, license or otherwise dispose of rights to technologies, product candidate or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves at an earlier stage or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available; or\n\u2022 liquidate and dissolve our company and cease as a going concern.\nOur future capital requirements will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 the size, complexity, results and timing of our clinical programs;\n\u2022 the cost to obtain sufficient supply of the compounds necessary for our product candidates at a reasonable cost;\n\u2022 the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\u2022 the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims; and\n\u2022 competing technological and market developments.\nThese factors could result in variations from our currently projected operating and liquidity requirements.\nBecause the data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates are not necessarily predictive of future results, we can provide no assurances that any of them will have favorable results in clinical trials or receive regulatory approval.\nBefore we can obtain regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any product candidate that we develop, we are required to complete preclinical development and extensive clinical trials in humans to demonstrate its safety and efficacy. To date, regulatory approval has not been obtained for any of our product candidates and, in fact, our product candidate Proellex\u00ae is currently on partial clinical hold with the FDA due to safety issues experienced in our earlier Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials for endometriosis and uterine fibroids, respectively. Additionally, On December 1, 2015, we announced that we had received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA from the submission of an NDA on our enclomiphene product candidate. A CRL informs companies that an NDA cannot be approved in its present form. In the CRL, the FDA stated that, based on recent scientific developments, the design of the enclomiphene Phase 3 studies is no longer adequate to demonstrate clinical benefit and recommended that Repros conduct an additional Phase 3 study or studies to support approval in the target population. The FDA also noted concerns regarding study entry criteria, titration and bioanalytical method validation in the Phase 3 program.\nUnfavorable results from ongoing preclinical studies or clinical trials could result in delays, modifications or abandonment of ongoing or future clinical trials. Clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals. Negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause a clinical trial to be delayed, repeated or terminated. In addition, we may report top-line data from time to time, which is based on a preliminary analysis of key efficacy and safety data; such data may be subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the applicable clinical trial. If enclomiphene, Proellex\u00ae, or any other potential future product candidate fails to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy in any clinical trial, we would experience potentially significant delays in, or be required to abandon, development of that product candidate. If we delay or abandon our development efforts related to enclomiphene or Proellex\u00ae, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues or raise the additional capital necessary to continue operations or become profitable.\nWe have a history of operating losses, and we expect to incur increasing net losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability for some time or at all.\nWe have experienced significant operating losses in each fiscal year since our inception. As of December 31, 2015, we had accumulated losses of $302.3 million, approximately $21.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, and accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately $2.9 million, in the aggregate. We expect to continue incurring net losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability for some time, if at all. As we increase expenditures for the clinical development of our products, we expect our total operating losses to increase for at least the next few years. Our ability to achieve profitability will depend on, among other things, successfully completing the development of our products, obtaining regulatory approvals, establishing marketing, sales and manufacturing capabilities or collaborative arrangements with others that possess such capabilities, and raising sufficient funds to finance our activities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve profitability or that profitability, if achieved, can be sustained.\nRaising additional funds by issuing securities or through collaboration and licensing arrangements may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nWe may raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or potential corporate collaborations and licensing arrangements. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders\u2019 ownership will be diluted. Any debt financing we enter into may involve covenants that restrict our operations. These restrictive covenants may include limitations on borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of our assets, as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens, pay dividends, redeem capital stock or make investments. In addition, if we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our potential products or proprietary technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. For example, we might be forced to relinquish all or a portion of our sales and marketing rights with respect to enclomiphene, Proellex\u00ae, or other potential products or license intellectual property that enables licensees to develop competing products.\nOur stock price could decline significantly based on the results and timing of clinical trials of, and regulatory and other decisions affecting, our product candidates.\nResults of clinical trials and preclinical studies of our current and potential product candidates may not be viewed favorably by us or third parties, including the FDA or other regulatory authorities, investors, analysts and potential collaborators. The same may be true of how we design the clinical trials of our product candidates and regulatory decisions affecting those clinical trials. Biopharmaceutical company stock prices have declined significantly when such results and decisions were unfavorable or perceived negatively or when a product candidate did not otherwise meet expectations. The final results from our clinical development programs may be negative, may not meet expectations or may be perceived negatively. The designs of our clinical trials (which may change significantly and be more expensive than currently anticipated depending on our clinical results and regulatory decisions) may also be viewed negatively by third parties. We may not be successful in completing these clinical trials on our projected timetable, if at all.\nFollowing the receipt of a Complete Response Letter with respect to our previously submitted NDA for enclomiphene, we may need to engage in additional clinical trials. Failure to initiate additional clinical trials or delays in existing clinical trials of enclomiphene or Proellex\u00ae, and failure of the FDA to lift the partial clinical hold on Proellex\u00ae, or unfavorable results or decisions or negative perceptions regarding any of such clinical trials, could cause our stock price to decline significantly. We may never achieve FDA approval for either of our product candidates, which could cause our stock price to decline significantly and have other significant adverse effects on our business.\nWe are thinly staffed and highly dependent on a limited number of management persons and key personnel, and if we lose these members of our team or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, our future growth and ability to compete would suffer.\nThe competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is intense, and our future success depends upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled scientific, technical and managerial employees. We had only 26 full-time employees at December 31, 2015, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, Joseph S. Podolski. We are highly dependent on Mr. Podolski and our professional staff for the management of our company and the development of our technologies. Mr. Podolski has an employment agreement with us. There can be no assurance that any of these employees will remain with us through development of our current product candidates. The loss of the services of any of our employees could delay or curtail our research and product development efforts.\nIf our employees commit fraud or other misconduct, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading, our business may experience serious adverse consequences.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, to provide accurate information to the FDA, to comply with manufacturing standards we have established, to comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, to report financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology systems to operate our business and a cyber attack or other breach of our systems, or those of third parties on whom we may rely, could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology systems to operate our business. A breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems by employees, others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit confidential information and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such information. Additionally, we outsource certain elements of our information technology systems to third parties. As a result of this outsourcing, our third party vendors may or could have access to our confidential information making such systems vulnerable. Data breaches of our information technology systems, or those of our third party vendors, may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. While we believe that we have taken appropriate security measures to protect our data and information technology systems, and have been informed by our third party vendors that they have as well, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems, or those of our third party vendors, that could adversely affect our business.\nOur plan to use collaborations to leverage our capabilities may not be successful.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may enter into collaboration arrangements with strategic partners to develop and commercialize our product candidates. For our collaboration efforts to be successful, we must identify partners whose competencies complement ours. We must also successfully enter into collaboration agreements with them on terms attractive to us and integrate and coordinate their resources and capabilities with our own. We may be unsuccessful in entering into collaboration agreements with acceptable partners or negotiating favorable terms in these agreements. In addition, we may face a disadvantage in seeking to enter into or negotiating collaborations with potential partners because other potential collaborators may have greater management and financial resources than we do. Also, we may be unsuccessful in integrating the resources or capabilities of these collaborators. In addition, our collaborators may prove difficult to work with or less skilled than we originally expected. If we are unsuccessful in our collaborative efforts, our ability to develop and market product candidates could be severely limited.\nWe are not prohibited from adopting, without shareholder approval, a shareholder rights plan that may discourage any potential acquirer from acquiring more than a specific percentage of our outstanding common stock. In addition, certain provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in management or a takeover attempt that you may consider to be in your best interest.\nOur shareholder rights plan expired in accordance with its terms on September13, 2015. While we did not extend or renew the plan, we are not prohibited from adopting, without shareholder approval, a shareholder rights plan that may discourage any potential acquirer from acquiring more than a specific percentage of our outstanding common stock. Upon this type of acquisition without approval of our Board of Directors, all other holders of common stock would have the right to purchase a specified amount of shares at a substantial discount from market price.\nSuch a rights agreement and certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under Delaware law could delay or prevent the removal of directors and other management and could make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us that you may consider to be in your best interest. For example, these provisions:\n\u2022 allow our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022 limit who can call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u2022 establish advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters to be acted upon at stockholder meetings.\nRisks Relating to Our Product Development Efforts\nChanges in existing regulations and the adoption of new regulations may increase our costs and otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur research and development activities, preclinical studies and clinical trials, and the manufacturing, marketing and labeling of any products we may develop, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries. Additional government regulation may be established that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates or materially increase our costs. Delays in obtaining or rejections of regulatory approvals would adversely affect our ability to commercialize any product candidate we develop and our ability to receive product revenues or to receive milestone payments or royalties from any product rights we might license to others. If regulatory approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or may be conditioned on the conduct of post-marketing surveillance studies.\nDelays in the commencement of clinical trials testing of our current and potential product candidates could result in increased costs to us and delay our ability to generate revenues.\nOur product candidates will require continued extensive clinical trials prior to the submission of a regulatory application for commercial sales. Because of the nature of clinical trials, we do not know whether future planned clinical trials will begin on time, if at all. Delays in the commencement of clinical trials could significantly increase our product development costs and delay any product commercialization. In addition, many of the factors that may cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.\nThe commencement of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in:\n\u2022 demonstrating sufficient safety and efficacy in past clinical trials to obtain regulatory approval to commence a further clinical trial;\n\u2022 convincing the FDA that we have selected valid endpoints for use in proposed clinical trials;\n\u2022 reaching agreements on acceptable terms with prospective contract manufacturers for manufacturing sufficient quantities of a product candidate; and\n\u2022 obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site.\nIn addition, the commencement of clinical trials may be delayed due to insufficient patient enrollment, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease, and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial.\nDelays in the completion of, or the termination of, clinical testing of our current and potential product candidates could result in increased costs to us, and could delay or prevent us from generating revenues.\nOnce a clinical trial has begun, it may be delayed, suspended or terminated by us or the FDA or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 lack of adequate funding to continue clinical trials;\n\u2022 lack of effectiveness of any product candidate during clinical trials;\n\u2022 side effects experienced by trial participants or other safety issues;\n\u2022 slower than expected rates of patient recruitment and enrollment or lower than expected patient retention rates;\n\u2022 delays or inability to manufacture or obtain sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials;\n\u2022 inadequacy of or changes in our manufacturing process or compound formulation;\n\u2022 delays in obtaining regulatory approvals to commence a trial, or \u201cclinical holds\u201d or delays requiring suspension or termination of a trial by a regulatory agency, such as the FDA, after a trial is commenced;\n\u2022 changes in applicable regulatory policies and regulations;\n\u2022 delays in identifying and reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical trial sites;\n\u2022 uncertainty regarding proper dosing;\n\u2022 unfavorable results from on-going clinical trials and preclinical studies;\n\u2022 failure of our clinical research organizations to comply with all regulatory and contractual requirements or otherwise fail to perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner;\n\u2022 scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions;\n\u2022 failure to construct appropriate clinical trial protocols;\n\u2022 insufficient data to support regulatory approval;\n\u2022 inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols;\n\u2022 difficulty in maintaining contact with subjects during or after treatment, which may result in incomplete data;\n\u2022 the timing of discussions and meetings with the FDA or other regulatory authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials; and\n\u2022 acceptability to the FDA of data obtained from clinical studies conducted in Europe or other non-United States jurisdictions.\nMany of these factors that may lead to a delay, suspension or termination of clinical testing of a current or potential product candidate may also ultimately lead to denial of regulatory approval of a current or potential product candidate. In fact, the FDA placed Proellex\u00ae on clinical hold in summer 2009 due to liver toxicity data resulting from our clinical trials. Though the full clinical hold has been upgraded to a partial clinical hold, there can be no assurance that the partial hold will be lifted at any time. Additionally, on December 1, 2015, we announced that we had received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA from the submission of an NDA on our enclomiphene product candidate. A CRL informs companies that an NDA cannot be approved in its present form. In the CRL, the FDA stated that, based on recent scientific developments, the design of the enclomiphene Phase 3 studies is no longer adequate to demonstrate clinical benefit and recommended that Repros conduct an additional Phase 3 study or studies to support approval in the target population. The FDA also noted concerns regarding study entry criteria, titration and bioanalytical method validation in the Phase 3 program.\nIf we experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, clinical testing of any product candidates in the future, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed.\nEven if we successfully complete clinical trials for Proellex\u00ae, there are no assurances that we will be able to submit, or obtain FDA approval of, a new drug application.\nThere can be no assurance that, if our clinical trials for Proellex\u00ae are successfully completed, we will be able to submit an NDA to the FDA or that any NDA we submit will be approved by the FDA in a timely manner, if at all. After completing clinical trials for a product candidate in humans, a drug dossier is prepared and submitted to the FDA as an NDA, and includes all preclinical studies and clinical trial data relevant to the safety and effectiveness of the product at the suggested dose and duration of use for the proposed indication, in order to allow the FDA to review such drug dossier and to consider a product candidate for approval for commercialization in the United States. If we are unable to submit an NDA with respect to Proellex\u00ae, or if any NDA we submit is not approved by the FDA, we will be unable to commercialize that product. The FDA can and does reject NDAs and requires additional clinical trials, even when drug candidates achieve favorable results in large-scale Phase 3 clinical trials. If we fail to commercialize Proellex\u00ae, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to continue operations or attain profitability and our reputation in the industry and in the investment community would likely be damaged.\nOur success in obtaining regulatory approval to market enclomiphene in the U.S. or elsewhere depends on our ability to address any issues the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may raise, and ultimately to obtain approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies.\nOn February 2, 2015, we announced that we submitted the NDA for enclomiphene to the FDA. The FDA accepted the NDA for review on April 1, 2015 and later assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of November 30, 2015. In addition, the Division of Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Products (the Division) of the FDA scheduled an advisory committee meeting to review the NDA for November 3, 2015. However, the Division subsequently cancelled the scheduled advisory committee meeting due to questions that arose late in the review regarding the bioanalytical method validation that could affect interpretability of certain pivotal study data. On December 1, 2015, we announced that we had received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA. A CRL informs companies that an NDA cannot be approved in its present form. In the CRL, the FDA stated that, based on recent scientific developments, the design of enclomiphene Phase 3 studies is no longer adequate to demonstrate clinical benefit and recommended that Repros conduct an additional Phase 3 study or studies to support approval in the target population. The FDA also noted concerns regarding study entry criteria, titration and bioanalytical method validation in the Phase 3 program. Subsequently, on February 4, 2016, the Company attended a meeting with the FDA reviewers and senior leaders to discuss resolution of issues identified during the NDA review. The meeting covered a broad range of topics surrounding the NDA data as well as emerging agency and expert thinking regarding the treatment of hypogonadism.\nEven if enclomiphene is eventually approved, the FDA may limit the indications for which it may be used, include extensive warnings on the product labeling, or require costly ongoing requirements for post-marketing clinical studies and surveillance or other risk management measures to monitor the safety or efficacy of enclomiphene. Further, in the event that we seek regulatory approval of enclomiphene outside the United States, such markets also have requirements for approval of drug candidates with which we must comply prior to marketing. Obtaining regulatory approval for marketing of enclomiphene in one country does not ensure we will be able to obtain regulatory approval in other countries but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in other countries.\nAny regulatory approval of enclomiphene, once obtained, may be withdrawn. Ultimately, the failure to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals would prevent enclomiphene from being marketed and would have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct clinical trials for our product candidates, and their failure to timely and properly perform their obligations may result in costs and delays that prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval or successfully commercializing our product candidates.\nWe rely on independent contractors, including researchers at clinical research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d), and universities, in certain areas that are particularly relevant to our research and product development plans, such as for data management for the conduct of clinical trials. The competition for these relationships is intense, and we may not be able to maintain our relationships with them on acceptable terms. Independent contractors generally may terminate their engagements at any time, subject to notice. As a result, we can control their activities only within certain limits, and they will devote only a certain amount of their time conducting research on and trials of our product candidates and assisting in developing them. If they do not successfully carry out their duties under their agreements with us, fail to inform us if these trials fail to comply with clinical trial protocols, or fail to meet expected deadlines, our clinical trials may need to be extended, delayed or terminated. We may not be able to enter into replacement arrangements without undue delays or excessive expenditures. If there are delays in testing or regulatory approvals as a result of the failure to perform by our independent contractors or other outside parties, our drug development costs will increase and we may not be able to attain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nIn addition, we have no control over the financial health of our independent contractors. Several of our independent contractors are in possession of valuable and sensitive information relating to the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, and several others provide services to a significant percentage of the patients enrolled in the respective clinical trials in which such independent contractors participate. Should one or more of these independent contractors become insolvent, or otherwise are not able to continue to provide services to us, the clinical trial in which such contractor participates could become significantly delayed and we may be adversely affected as a result of the delays and additional expenses associated with such event.\nAny of our future product candidates may cause adverse effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the scope of any approved label or market acceptance.\nAdverse events, or AEs, caused by our future product candidates could cause us, other reviewing entities, clinical trial sites or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in the denial of regulatory approval.\nIf AEs are observed in any clinical trials of our future product candidates, including those that our strategic partners may develop under our alliance agreements, our or our partners\u2019 ability to obtain regulatory approval for product candidates may be negatively impacted.\nFurther, if any of our future products, if and when approved for commercial sale, cause serious or unexpected side effects, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u00b7 regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or impose restrictions on its distribution in the form of a modified risk evaluation and mitigation strategy;\n\u00b7 regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications;\n\u00b7 we may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical trials;\n\u00b7 we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; or\n\u00b7 our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us or our partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our future products and impair our ability to generate revenues from the commercialization of these products either by us or by our strategic alliance partners.\nThe risk of accidental contamination or injury resulting from our handling and disposing of hazardous materials and chemicals may expose us to litigation.\nOur research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. Although we believe that our procedures for handling and disposing of those materials comply with state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. If such an accident occurs, we could be held liable for resulting damages, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nRisks Relating to Manufacturing Our Products\nWe currently rely on third-party manufacturers and other third parties for production of our product candidates, and our dependence on these manufacturers may impair the development of our product candidates.\nCurrently, we do not have the ability internally to manufacture the product candidates that we need to conduct our clinical trials. We terminated our supply agreement with Gedeon Richter for the manufacturing of Proellex\u00ae due to the clinical hold imposed by the FDA in August 2009; however, we believe that we have a sufficient supply of Proellex\u00ae currently available for our current and planned clinical trial efforts. In the event we require an additional supply of Proellex\u00ae, we believe that we have maintained a good relationship with Gedeon Richter and that an agreement could be reached with Gedeon Richter to provide such supply when and if needed, but we cannot assure you this will be the case.\nWe have identified multiple potential suppliers for the bulk active pharmaceutical ingredient (\u201cAPI\u201d) used in enclomiphene, though we have not yet contracted with one. We have not faced any material problems obtaining the necessary quantities of enclomiphene for our clinical trials and, therefore, do not anticipate any material problems obtaining the API necessary for commercial production if enclomiphene is approved for sale. Additionally, we have contracted with Gregory Pharmaceutical Holdings, Inc., doing business as UPM Pharmaceuticals, for the finished drug product and packaging of enclomiphene for commercial production, if approved by the FDA for sale.\nFor the foreseeable future, we expect to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers and other third parties to produce, package and store sufficient quantities of enclomiphene, Proellex\u00ae, and any future product candidates for use in our clinical trials or commercialization, if appropriate. These product candidates are complicated and expensive to manufacture. If our third-party manufacturers fail to deliver our product candidates for clinical use on a timely basis, with sufficient quality, and at commercially reasonable prices, we may be required to delay or suspend clinical trials or otherwise discontinue development and production of our product candidates. While we may be able to identify replacement third-party manufacturers or develop our own manufacturing capabilities for these product candidates, this process would likely cause a delay in the availability of our product candidates and an increase in costs. In addition, third-party manufacturers may have a limited number of facilities in which our product candidates can be produced, and any interruption of the operation of those facilities due to events such as equipment malfunction or failure or damage to the facility by natural disasters could result in the cancellation of shipments, loss of product in the manufacturing process or a shortfall in available product candidates.\nIdentification of previously unknown problems with respect to a product, manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or facility.\nThe FDA stringently applies regulatory standards for the manufacturing of our products. Identification of previously unknown problems with respect to a product, manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or facility, including warning letters, suspensions of regulatory approvals, operating restrictions, delays in obtaining new product approvals, withdrawal of the product from the market, product recalls, fines, injunctions and criminal prosecution. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur product candidates have only been manufactured in small quantities to date, and we may face delays or complications in manufacturing quantities of our product candidates in sufficient quantities to meet the demands of late stage clinical trials and marketing.\nWe cannot assure that we will be able to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity or scale-up manufacturing volume per batch, whether on our own or in reliance on third-party manufacturers, for any of our product candidates in a timely or economical manner, or at all. To date our product candidates have been manufactured exclusively by third parties in small quantities for preclinical studies and clinical trials. Future clinical trials of our product candidates, if any, will require increased quantities for future commercial sales in the event that such product candidates are approved by the FDA or foreign regulatory bodies. Significant scale-up of manufacturing requires certain additional developmental work, which the FDA must review and approve to assure product comparability. If we or our third-party manufacturers are unable to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for a product candidate, the regulatory approval or commercial launch of that product candidate may be delayed or there may be a shortage in supply of that product candidate.\nOur product candidates require precise, high-quality manufacturing which may not be available at acceptable costs.\nEnclomiphene and Proellex\u00ae are novel compounds that have never been produced in large scale. As in the development of any new compound, there are underlying risks associated with their manufacture. These risks include, but are not limited to, cost, process scale-up, process reproducibility, construction of a suitable process plant, timely availability of raw materials, as well as regulatory issues associated with the manufacture of an active pharmaceutical agent. Any of these risks may prevent us from successfully developing enclomiphene or Proellex\u00ae. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers to achieve and maintain these high manufacturing standards, including the incidence of manufacturing errors and reliable product packaging for diverse environmental conditions, could result in patient injury or death, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or failures in product testing or delivery, cost overruns or other problems that could seriously hurt our business.\nWe may experience delays in the development of our product candidates if the third-party manufacturers of our product candidates cannot meet FDA requirements relating to Good Manufacturing Practices.\nOur third-party manufacturers are required to produce our product candidates under FDA current Good Manufacturing Practices in order to meet acceptable standards for our clinical trials. If such standards change, the ability of third-party manufacturers to produce our product candidates on the schedule we require for our clinical trials may be affected. In addition, third-party manufacturers may not perform their obligations under their agreements with us or may discontinue their business before the time required by us to gain approval for or commercialize our product candidates. Any difficulties or delays in the manufacturing and supply of our product candidates could increase our costs or cause us to lose revenue or postpone or cancel clinical trials.\nThe FDA also requires that we demonstrate structural and functional comparability between the same drug product produced by different third-party manufacturers. Because we may use multiple sources to manufacture enclomiphene and Proellex\u00ae, we may need to conduct comparability studies to assess whether manufacturing changes have affected the product safety, identity, purity or potency of any commercial product candidate compared to the product candidate used in clinical trials. If we are unable to demonstrate comparability, the FDA could require us to conduct additional clinical trials, which would be expensive and significantly delay commercialization of our product candidates.\nRisks Relating to Product Commercialization\nIf commercialized, our product candidates may not be approved for sufficient governmental or third-party reimbursements, which would adversely affect our ability to market our product candidates.\nIn the United States and elsewhere, sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third-party payers, such as government and private insurance plans. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. It will be time consuming and expensive for us to go through the process of seeking reimbursement from Medicaid, Medicare and private payers for Proellex\u00ae and enclomiphene. Our products may not be considered cost effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis. The passage of the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2003 imposes requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs, which may negatively affect the marketing of our potential products.\nIf we successfully develop products but those products do not achieve and maintain market acceptance, our business will not be profitable.\nEven if our product candidates are approved for commercial sale by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the degree of market acceptance of any approved product by physicians, healthcare professionals and third-party payers and our profitability and growth will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022 the prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects;\n\u2022 availability, effectiveness and cost of alternative treatments;\n\u2022 pricing and cost effectiveness of our drugs;\n\u2022 effectiveness of our or collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategies; and\n\u2022 our ability to obtain sufficient third-party insurance coverage or reimbursement.\nIf enclomiphene does not provide a treatment regime that is more beneficial than AndroGel\u00ae, the current standard of care for the treatment of testosterone deficiency, or otherwise provide patient benefit, it likely will not be accepted favorably by the market. If any products we may develop do not achieve market acceptance, then we will not generate sufficient revenue to achieve or maintain profitability.\nIn addition, even if our products achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to maintain that market acceptance over time if:\n\u2022 new products or technologies are introduced that are more favorably received than our products, are more cost effective or render our products obsolete;\n\u2022 unforeseen complications arise with respect to use of our products; or\n\u2022 sufficient third-party insurance coverage or reimbursement does not remain available.\nIn many foreign markets, including the countries in the European Union, pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control. In the United States, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental pricing controls. While we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nOur liability insurance may neither provide adequate coverage nor may it always be available on favorable terms or at all.\nNeither enclomiphene nor Proellex\u00ae has been approved for commercial sale. However, the current and future use of our product candidates by us and potential corporate collaborators in clinical trials, and the sale of any approved products in the future, may expose us to liability claims. These claims might be made directly by consumers or healthcare providers or indirectly by pharmaceutical companies, potential corporate collaborators or others selling such products. We may experience financial losses in the future due to product liability claims. We have obtained limited general commercial liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials. We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates. However, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses. If a successful product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or for liabilities in excess of our insurance limits, our assets may not be sufficient to cover such claims and our business operations could be impaired.\nWe face significant competition from many companies with substantially greater resources than we have and other possible advantages.\nWe are engaged in biopharmaceutical product development, an industry that is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress. The biopharmaceutical industry is also highly competitive. Our success will depend on our ability to acquire, develop and commercialize products and our ability to establish and maintain markets for any products for which we receive marketing approval. Potential competitors in North America, Europe and elsewhere include major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology firms, universities and other research institutions and government agencies. Many of our competitors have substantially greater research and development and regulatory capabilities and experience, and substantially greater management, manufacturing, distribution, marketing and financial resources, than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may:\n\u2022 develop or license products or other novel technologies that are more effective, safer or less costly than the product candidates that we are developing;\n\u2022 obtain regulatory approval for products before we do; or\n\u2022 commit more resources than we can to developing, marketing and selling competing products.\nOur main competitors for the treatment of testosterone deficiency are the testosterone replacement therapies currently being marketed. The current standard of care is AndroGel\u00ae, a topical gel for the replacement of testosterone developed by Solvay Pharmaceuticals (which was acquired by Abbvie Inc.). Abbvie is a much larger company than we are, with greater resources and marketing ability. Enclomiphene would also compete with other forms of testosterone replacement therapies such as oral treatments, patches, injectables and a tablet applied to the upper gum. There is another topical gel currently marketed by Endo International PLC called Testim\u00ae, and a transdermal patch marketed by Watson Pharmaceuticals called AndroDerm\u00ae. Eli Lilly and Company also entered into a licensing agreement with a third party for a topical testosterone treatment called Axiron\u00ae, which has become available in pharmacies. There can be no assurance that our product candidates will be more successful than competitive products. In addition, other potential competitors may be developing testosterone therapies similar to ours.\nThe main therapeutic products competitive with Proellex\u00ae for the treatment of uterine fibroids and endometriosis are GnRH agonists, including Lupron\u00ae and the use of approved progestin-based contraceptives for the treatment of endometriosis. In addition, surgical treatment of both uterine fibroids and endometriosis would compete with Proellex\u00ae, if approved, by removing uterine fibroids and by removing misplaced tissue in women with endometriosis. Furthermore, Abbvie has recently licensed a Phase 3-ready molecule from Neurocrine Biosciences Inc. for the treatment of endometriosis. Gedeon Richter and Watson Pharmaceuticals have also entered into an exclusive license agreement to develop and market Esmya\u2122 (an orally selective progesterone receptor modulator) in the U.S. and Canada.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\nA third party individual holds two issued patents related to the use of an anti-estrogen such as clomiphene citrate in the treatment of disorders related to androgen deficiency.\nWe requested re-examination of one of these patents by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cPTO\u201d) based on prior art. The patent holder amended the claims in the re-examination proceedings, which led the PTO to determine that the amended claims were patentable in view of those publications under consideration and a re-examination certificate was issued. We subsequently filed a second request for re-examination by the PTO in light of a number of additional publications. The request was granted and all of the claims were finally rejected by the PTO in the re-examination. The patent holder appealed the rejections to the PTO Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (the \u201cPTO Board\u201d) which ultimately reversed the rejections of several dependent claims in view of those publications under consideration. The patent holder filed a Notice of Appeal to the Federal Circuit on September 28, 2010 contesting the rejections maintained by the PTO Board. A decision was rendered by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on December 12, 2011, affirming the rejection of the appealed claims. The PTO issued an Ex Parte Reexamination Certificate on April 29, 2013, canceling the rejected claims and confirming the patentability of the remaining claims. Nevertheless, we believe that our development of enclomiphene does not infringe any of the remaining claims and that all of the remaining claims are invalid on various grounds including additional prior art publications. We also believe that the second of these two patents is invalid in view of published prior art not considered by the PTO. If necessary, we intend to vigorously defend any and all claims that may be brought by the holder of such patents in a court of competent jurisdiction in order to develop enclomiphene further. Adverse determinations in litigation proceedings could require us to seek licenses which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or subject us to significant liabilities, in which case we may not be able to successfully commercialize or out-license enclomiphene until such patents expire or are otherwise no longer in force.\nWe licensed our rights to Proellex\u00ae from the NIH and our inability to fulfill our commitments and obligations under such license may result in forfeiture of our rights.\nOur rights to Proellex\u00ae are licensed exclusively to us from the NIH under a license agreement. This license agreement contains numerous detailed performance obligations, with time sensitive dates for compliance, relating to clinical development and commercialization activities required by us or our designated third-party providers, as well as additional financial milestones and royalties. Failure to achieve the benchmarks specified in the commercial development plan attached to the license agreement or meet payment obligations could result in termination of the license agreement and the loss of our rights to develop and commercialize Proellex\u00ae. We periodically update the commercial development plan as such plans evolve. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet any or all of the performance objectives in the future on a timely basis or at all, or that, if we fail to meet any of such objectives, the NIH will agree to revised objectives. The NIH also has the ability to terminate the agreement for an uncured material breach of the agreement, if we do not keep Proellex\u00ae reasonably available to the public after commercial launch or if we cannot reasonably satisfy unmet health and safety needs, among other reasons.\nThere can be no assurance that our manufacture, use or sale of our product candidates will not infringe on the patent rights of others.\nThere can be no assurance that the manufacture, use or sale of any of our product candidates will not infringe the patent rights of others. We may be unable to avoid infringement of the patent rights of others and may be required to seek a license, defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of the patents in court. There can be no assurance that a license to the allegedly infringed patents will be available to us on terms and conditions acceptable to us, if at all, or that we will prevail in any patent litigation. Patent litigation is extremely costly and time-consuming, and there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to defend any possible litigation related to such infringement. If we do not obtain a license on acceptable terms under such patents, or are found liable for infringement, or are not able to have such patents declared invalid, we may be liable for significant money damages, may encounter significant delays in bringing our product candidates to market, or may be precluded from participating in the manufacture, use or sale of any such product candidates, any of which would materially and adversely affect our business.\nA dispute regarding the infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of others could be costly and result in delays in our research and development activities.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability to develop and manufacture our product candidates and market and sell drugs, if any, and conduct our research and development activities without infringing or misappropriating the proprietary rights of others. We may be exposed to future litigation by others based on claims that our product candidates, technologies or activities infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Numerous United States and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by others also exist in the therapeutic areas in, and for the therapeutic targets for, which we are developing drugs. These could materially affect our ability to develop our product candidates or sell drugs, and our activities, or those of our licensor or future collaborators, could be determined to infringe these patents. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that our drug candidates or technologies may infringe. There also may be existing patents, of which we are not aware, that our product candidates or technologies may infringe. Further, there may be issued patents and pending patent applications in fields relevant to our business, of which we are or may become aware, that we believe we do not infringe or that we believe are invalid or relate to immaterial portions of our overall drug discovery and development efforts. We cannot assure you that others holding any of these patents or patent applications will not assert infringement claims against us for damages or seeking to enjoin our activities. We also cannot assure you that, in the event of litigation, we will be able to successfully assert any belief we may have as to non-infringement, invalidity or immateriality, or that any infringement claims will be resolved in our favor.\nIn addition, others may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights, and we may have to institute costly legal action to protect our intellectual property rights. We may not be able to afford the costs of enforcing or defending our intellectual property rights against others. There could also be significant litigation and other administrative proceedings in our industry that affect us regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Any legal action or administrative action against us, or our collaborators, claiming damages or seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to our drug discovery and development programs could:\n\u2022 require us, or potential collaborators, to obtain a license to continue to use, manufacture or market the affected drugs, methods or processes, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u2022 prevent us from importing, making, using, selling or offering to sell the subject matter claimed in patents held by others and subject us to potential liability for damages; or\n\u2022 consume a substantial portion of our managerial, scientific and financial resources; or be costly, regardless of the outcome.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of pre-trial documents and witness discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, during the course of this kind of litigation, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock or warrants.\nWe face substantial uncertainty in our ability to protect our patents and proprietary technology.\nOur ability to commercialize our products will depend, in part, on our or our licensor\u2019s ability to obtain patents, to enforce those patents and preserve trade secrets, and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. There can be no assurance that:\n\u2022 Patent applications for and relating to our products candidates, enclomiphene and Proellex\u00ae, will result in issued patents;\n\u2022 Patent protection will be secured for any particular technology;\n\u2022 Any patents that have been or may be issued to us, such as our issued patents and/or pending patent applications relating to Proellex\u00ae or enclomiphene, or any patents that have been or may be issued to our licensor, such as the patent(s) and application(s) underlying our Proellex\u00ae compound, when issued, will be valid and enforceable;\n\u2022 any patents will provide meaningful protection to us;\n\u2022 others will not be able to design around the patents; or\n\u2022 our patents will provide a competitive advantage or have commercial application.\nThe failure to obtain and maintain adequate patent protection would have a material adverse effect on us and may adversely affect our ability to enter into, or affect the terms of, any arrangement for the marketing of any product.\nWe cannot assure that our patents will not be challenged by others.\nThere can be no assurance that patents owned by or licensed to us will not be challenged by others. We could incur substantial costs in proceedings, including interference proceedings before the PTO and comparable proceedings before similar agencies in other countries in connection with any claims that may arise in the future. These proceedings could result in adverse decisions about the patentability of our or our licensor\u2019s inventions and products, as well as about the enforceability, validity or scope of protection afforded by the patents. Any adverse decisions about the patentability of our product candidates could cause us to either lose rights to develop and commercialize our product candidates or to license such rights at substantial cost to us. In addition, even if we were successful in such proceedings, the cost and delay of such proceedings would most likely have a material adverse effect on our business.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information, may not adequately protect our intellectual property, and will not prevent third parties from independently discovering technology similar to or in competition with our intellectual property.\nWe rely on trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information in our product development activities. To the extent we rely on trade secrets and unpatented know-how to maintain our competitive technological position, there can be no assurance that others may not independently develop the same or similar technologies. We seek to protect trade secrets and proprietary knowledge, in part, through confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors, collaborators and contractors. Nevertheless, these agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our confidential information and may not provide us with an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information. If our employees, scientific consultants, advisors, collaborators or contractors develop inventions or processes independently that may be applicable to our technologies, product candidates or products, disputes may arise about ownership of proprietary rights to those inventions and processes. Such inventions and processes will not necessarily become our property, but may remain the property of those persons or their employers. Protracted and costly litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. If we fail to obtain or maintain trade secret protection for any reason, the competition we face could increase, reducing our potential revenues and adversely affecting our ability to attain or maintain profitability.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may be subject to claims that we, or our employees, independent contractors or consultants, have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nWe cannot protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting, and defending patents on all of our drug discovery technologies and all of our potential drug candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our technologies to develop their own drugs in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection. These drugs may compete with our drugs, if any, and may not be covered by any of our patent claims or other intellectual property rights. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. Many countries, including certain countries in Europe, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties (for example, the patent owner has failed to \u201cwork\u201d the invention in that country or the third party has patented improvements). In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of the patent. Compulsory licensing of life-saving drugs is also becoming increasingly popular in developing countries either through direct legislation or international initiatives. Such compulsory licenses could be extended to include some of our drug candidates, which could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Moreover, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology and/or pharmaceuticals, which makes it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile and is likely to be volatile in the future.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile. Since January 1, 2014 through February 26, 2016, the sale price of our stock price has fluctuated from a low of $0.80 to a high of $22.57. The market price for our common stock will be affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 the denial or delay of regulatory clearances or approvals of our drug candidates or receipt of regulatory approval of competing products;\n\u2022 our ability to accomplish clinical, regulatory and other product development milestones;\n\u2022 the ability of our product candidates, if they receive regulatory approval, to achieve market success;\n\u2022 the performance of third-party manufacturers and suppliers;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors;\n\u2022 developments with respect to patents and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022 sales of common stock or other securities by us or our stockholders in the future;\n\u2022 additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u2022 disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our products;\n\u2022 trading volume of our common stock and warrants;\n\u2022 investor perceptions about us and our industry;\n\u2022 public reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and SEC and other filings;\n\u2022 the failure of analysts to cover our common stock, or changes in analysts\u2019 estimates or recommendations;\n\u2022 the failure by us to meet analysts\u2019 projections or guidance;\n\u2022 general market conditions and other factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors; and\n\u2022 the other factors described elsewhere in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d or the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d contained in our other public filings.\nThe stock prices of many companies in the biotechnology industry have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. Following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation often has been initiated against a company. If any class action litigation is initiated against us, we may incur substantial costs and our management\u2019s attention may be diverted from our operations, which could significantly harm our business.\nOur common stock is thinly traded and in the future, may continue to be thinly traded, and our stockholders may be unable to sell at or near asking prices or at all if they need to sell their shares to raise money or otherwise desire to liquidate such shares.\nTo date, we have a low volume of daily trades in our common stock on NASDAQ. For example, the average daily trading volume in our common stock on NASDAQ during the fourth quarter of 2015 was approximately 943,142 shares per day. Our stockholders may be unable to sell their common stock at or near their asking prices or at all, which may result in substantial losses to our stockholders.\nThe market for our common stock may be characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers, and we expect that our share price will be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. As noted above, our common stock may be sporadically and/or thinly traded. As a consequence of this lack of liquidity, the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our stockholders may disproportionately influence the price of those shares in either direction. The price for our shares could, for example, decline significantly in the event that a large number of our common stock are sold on the market without commensurate demand, as compared to a seasoned issuer that could better absorb those sales without adverse impact on its share price.\nOur inability to comply with the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market could result in our common stock being delisted, which could affect their market price and liquidity and reduce our ability to raise capital.\nWe are required to meet certain qualitative and financial tests (including a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share for our common stock) to maintain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. If we do not maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements for the Nasdaq Capital Market within specified periods and subject to permitted extensions, our common stock may be recommended for delisting (subject to any appeal we would file). If our common stock are delisted, it could be more difficult to buy or sell our common stock and to obtain accurate quotations, and the price of our common stock could suffer a material decline. Delisting would also impair our ability to raise capital.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nThe Tax Reform Act of 1986 provided for a limitation on the use of NOL and tax credit carryforwards following certain ownership changes that could limit the Company\u2019s ability to utilize these NOLs and tax credits. The limitation is generally referred to as the \u201csection 382 limit\u201d after the IRC section. The issuance of stock, together with changes in stock ownership, resulted in multiple ownership changes for federal income tax purposes. During 2013, the Company completed an analysis of its section 382 limit. Based on this analysis, the Company concluded that the amount of NOL carryforwards and the credits available to offset taxable income is limited under section 382. Accordingly, if the Company generates taxable income in any year in excess of its then annual limitation, the Company may be required to pay federal income taxes even though it has unexpired NOL carryforwards. Additionally, because U.S. tax laws limit the time during which NOLs and tax credit carryforwards may be applied against future taxable income and tax liabilities, the Company may not be able to take full advantage of its NOLs and tax credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes. Future public and private stock placements may create additional limitations on the Company\u2019s NOLs, credits and other tax attributes.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock.", "PERMNO": 79025, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "RPRX.1"}
