{"cik": "716634", "company": "READING INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nLike any other investment, investing in our securities involves risk. Set forth below is a summary of various risk factors that you should consider in connection with your investment in our Company. This summary should be considered in the context of our overall Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBUSINESS RISK FACTORS\nWe are in the cinema exhibition and real estate businesses. We discuss separately the risks we believe to be material to our involvement in each of these segments. We have discussed separately the risks relating to the international nature of our business activities, our use of leverage, and our status as a controlled corporation. While we report the results of our live theatre operations as real estate operations - because we are principally in the business of renting space to producers rather than in producing plays ourselves - the cinema exhibition and live theatre businesses share certain risk factors and are, accordingly, discussed together.\nCinema Exhibition and Live Theatre Business Risk Factors\nOur cinema and live theatre businesses are dependent upon attendance and, accordingly, are vulnerable to the adverse effects of the coronavirus outbreak which has resulted in government ordered closures, imposition of social distancing requirements, and changes in film release patterns, and may even after reopening adversely affect the public\u2019s acceptance of auditorium-based entertainment. These situations may be repeated in the event of future pandemics. As demonstrated by the governmental and public response to the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses that bring large numbers of unrelated people together in an enclosed environment are particularly vulnerable to business disruption in the face of contagious disease with life threatening potential. Not only may government authorities order closures or reduce operating capacities, but the public may feel uncomfortable attending our performances in the face of such an infectious disease risk. Our cinema business has high fixed costs (rent and increasing labor) and our revenue in this segment (ticket sales, food and beverage sales, screen advertising fees) is directly tied to our success at attracting customers to our venues.\nWe are dependent upon third parties to supply the entertainment product we need for our cinemas and live theatres to attract customers. We do not produce the films we show at our cinemas and, generally speaking, we do not produce the plays that are performed at our live theatres. Film distributors have no obligation to supply us with film and producers have no obligation to make use of our live theatres.\nWe face competition from other sources of entertainment and other entertainment delivery systems. Both our cinema and live theatre operations face competition from \u201cin-home\u201d and mobile device sources of entertainment. These include competition from network, cable and satellite television, and Video on Demand, internet streaming video services such as Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, HBO+, Peacock, and AmazonPrime, and social media or user generated internet programing such as, YouTube, TikTok, Reddit, Instagram, and Snapchat, video games and other sources of entertainment. The quality of \u201cin-home\u201d and mobile entertainment systems, as well as programming available on an in-home and mobile basis, has increased, while the cost to consumers of such systems (and such programming) has decreased in recent periods, and some consumers may prefer the security and/or convenience of an \u201cin-home\u201d or mobile entertainment experience to the more public and presentation-oriented experience offered by our cinemas and live theatres. Film distributors have been responding to these developments by, in some cases, decreasing or eliminating the period of time between cinema release and the date such product is made available to \u201cin-home\u201d or mobile forms of distribution. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many distributors have moved product onto their proprietary streaming service platforms or onto third party platforms (like Netflix) either in lieu of or simultaneously with a cinema release. Also, even before the recent pandemic, some traditional in-home and mobile distributors had begun the production of full-length movies, specifically for the purpose of direct or simultaneous release to the in-home and mobile markets. Cinemas will need to meet these competitive factors to continue to attract customers. This may require substantial capital outlays and increased labor expense, which exhibitors may not be able to fully pass on to their customers.\nWe also face competition from various other forms of \u201cbeyond-the-home\u201d entertainment, including sporting events, concerts, restaurants, casinos, video game arcades, and nightclubs. Our cinemas also face competition from live theatres and vice versa.\nSupply chain disruptions may negatively impact our operating results. We rely on certain suppliers for a number of our products, supplies and services. Shortages, delays, or interruptions in the availability of food and beverage items and other supplies to our theatres and restaurants may be caused by adverse weather conditions; natural disasters; governmental regulation; recalls; commodity availability; seasonality; public health crises or pandemics; labor issues or other operational disruptions; the inability of our suppliers to manage adverse business conditions, obtain credit or remain solvent; or other conditions beyond our control. Such shortages, delays or interruptions could adversely affect the availability, quality, and cost of the items we buy and the operations of our business. Supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products that are critical to our operations. Since we have begun reopening our cinemas, we have, in some cases, experienced difficulties in maintaining a consistent supply, seen delays in production and deliveries, been required to identify alternative suppliers, and suspended sales regionally or entirely. We expect these issues to\n- 20 -\ncontinue for the foreseeable future and plan to minimize the impact by focusing on the supply of those items with the greatest impact on our sales and operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment with many competitors who are significantly larger and may have significantly better access to films and to funds than we do. We are a comparatively small cinema operator and face competition from much larger exhibitors who are able to offer distributors more screens in more markets - including markets where they may be the exclusive exhibitor - than can we. This may adversely impact our access to films, which may adversely affect our revenue and profitability. These larger competitors may also enjoy (i) greater cash flow, which can be used to develop additional cinemas, including cinemas that may be competitive with our existing cinemas, (ii) better access to equity capital and debt, (iii) better visibility to landlords and real estate developers, (iv) for the sake of building volume, to operate cinemas with margins below our threshold for cinema acquisitions and/or development, and (v) better economies of scale. Access to reasonably priced funding is increasingly important as cinema operators need to upgrade their presentation, food and beverage in order to compete with in-home entertainment options.\nIn the case of our live theatres, we compete for shows not only with other \u201cfor-profit\u201d Off-Broadway theatres, but also with \u201cnot-for-profit\u201d operators and, increasingly, with Broadway theatres. We believe our live theatres are generally competitive with other Off-Broadway venues. However, due to the increased cost of staging live theatre productions, we are seeing an increasing tendency for plays that would historically have been staged in an Off-Broadway theatre moving directly to larger Broadway venues.\nWe are vulnerable to a variety of factors which are beyond our control.\n\uf0b7Our cinema and live theatre businesses may be vulnerable to fears of terrorism and random shooter incidents which could cause customers to avoid public assembly venues. Events, such as terrorist attacks and random shooter incidents may discourage patrons from attending our cinemas. We believe that recent shooting incidents have resulted in material increases in insurance premiums for cinema operators.\n\uf0b7Our cinema business may be vulnerable to natural disasters. Natural disasters, such as tropical storms, floods, fires, and earthquakes, have damaged and forced the temporary closure, and are likely in the future to similarly impact, our cinema operations. A material portion of our cinemas are located in seismically active areas, such as California, Hawaii and New Zealand.\n\uf0b7We are not in an essential business and accordingly may be more subject to general economic conditions than some other businesses. Going to a movie or a play is a luxury, not a necessity. Furthermore, consumer demand for better and better amenities and food offerings have resulted in an increase of the cost of a night at the movies. Accordingly, a decline in the economy resulting in a decrease in discretionary income, or a perception of such a decline, may result in decreased discretionary spending, which could adversely affect our cinema and live theatre businesses. Adverse economic conditions can also affect the supply side of our business, as reduced liquidity can adversely affect the availability of funding for movies and plays. This is particularly true in the case of Off-Broadway plays, which are often times financed by high net worth individuals (or groups of such individuals) and that are very risky due to the absence of any ability to recoup investment in secondary markets like - cable, satellite or internet distribution.\nWe face competition from competitors offering food and beverage and luxury seating as an integral part of their cinema offerings. The number of our competitors offering an expanded food and beverage menu (including the sale of alcoholic beverages) and luxury seating, has continued to grow in recent periods. In addition, more competitors such as AMC are converting existing cinemas to provide such expanded menu offerings and in-theater dining options. The existence of such cinemas may alter traditional cinema selection practices of moviegoers, as they seek out cinemas with such expanded offerings as a preferred alternative to traditional cinemas. In order to compete with these new cinemas, the Company has been required to materially increase its capital expenditures to add such features to many of our cinemas and to take on additional and more highly trained (and, consequently, compensated) staff. Also, the conversion to luxury seating typically requires a material reduction in the number of seats that an auditorium can accommodate which may translate into fewer movie tickets being sold and the shutdown (or limitation of activities) during the time required to complete such modifications.\nOur failure to obtain and maintain liquor licenses at any of our cinemas could adversely affect our ability to compete. Each of our cinemas offering alcoholic beverages, is subject to licensing and regulation. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations of each cinema, including minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. The failure to receive or retain a liquor license, or any other required permit or license, in a particular location, or to continue to qualify for, or renew licenses, could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, our ability to attract patrons, and our ability to obtain such a liquor license in other locations.\nWe may be subject to increased labor and benefits costs generally. Like most market actors, we are subject to inflationary pressures which have resulted in increased costs of goods and increased cost of film. Our labor costs more as post COVID-19 worker shortages continue, particularly in the minimum wage sector where we operate. Our cinemas are a major user of electricity, and utility costs are\n- 21 -\nalso rising. Given competitive pressures and other forces adversely impacting movie attendances, it may not be possible to pass all or any material portion of these increased costs on to consumers. In addition, we are subject to a variety of changing laws governing such matters as minimum wages, access to benefits and paid or unpaid leave, working conditions and overtime under which minor violations can result in material liabilities. In California and New York, in particular, law firms have developed which advertise for plaintiffs and bring such cases on a class action, contingent fee basis, where typically between 25% and 40% of any recovery goes to the law firm. Moreover, given the statutory basis of such claims, insurance is not available to cover such exposure. In recent periods, legislatures have been active increasing minimum wages, mandating minimum hours or imposing notice and leave provisions that make it increasingly difficult to adjust staffing levels to accommodate fluctuating cinema attendance levels, all of which have resulted in increased operating costs as we work to maintain a high level of amenity to our customers.\nReal Estate Development and Ownership Business Risks\nSpecific Risks Related to Our Real Estate Business.\nOur real estate business is vulnerable to the effects from the coronavirus outbreak which has adversely impacted our retail tenants' operations and, in turn, resulted in an increase in tenant defaults and rent reductions. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the closure or reduced capacity of certain of our retail tenants. All of our ETCs are anchored by our cinemas, which suffered temporary closures and/or reductions in seating capacities during the COVID-19 Pandemic, thereby reducing foot traffic to our ETCs. In some cases, we have been compelled to provide our tenants with rent abatements or deferrals.\nCompetition from the Digital Economy may adversely impact our ability to lease and obtain reasonable rents for our properties. An increasing amount of shopping is being done online, a trend that has been given momentum by the stay-at-home admonitions and restrictions associated with our battle against the COVID virus. This has adversely impacted retail tenants (particularly those dealing in consumer goods), which may impact our ability to attract such retailers and to obtain rents at historic levels. This is a particular risk to us, given our high percentage of retail tenants. Also, initially motivated by the need to work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, employers are rethinking the scope and extent of the need for their office space. Some markets may have become overbuilt, which may complicate our ability to lease our properties, to obtain reasonable rents, and to finance future development.\nMany of our Properties are located in areas prone to natural disasters. Many of our properties are located in areas subject to a risk of fires such as California and Australia; of hurricanes, tropical storms and/or flooding, such as Australia, California, Hawaii and New York, New Jersey; or earthquakes in New Zealand, Hawaii and California. The availability of insurance for natural disasters (particularly earthquake) may be limited.\nOur entertainment properties may be more subject to access litigation than other properties. Substantially all our properties consist of, or include as a material component, entertainment venues. These facilities may attract more access-based litigation (for example, claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act) than other types of real estate.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment in which we must compete against companies with much greater financial and human resources than we have. We have limited financial and human resources, compared to our principal real estate competitors. In recent periods, we have relied heavily on outside professionals in connection with our real estate development activities. Many of our competitors have significantly greater resources and may be able to achieve greater economies of scale than we can. Given our structure as a taxable corporation, our cost of capital is typically higher than other real estate investment vehicles such as real estate investment trusts.\nRisks Related to the Real Estate Industry Generally\nOur financial performance will be affected by risks associated with the real estate industry generally. Events and conditions generally applicable to developers, owners, and operators of real property will affect our performance as well. These include (i) changes in the national, regional and local economic climate, (ii) local conditions, such as an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, commercial space and/or entertainment-oriented properties, (iii) reduced attractiveness of our properties to tenants, (iv) the rental rates and capitalization rates applicable to the markets in which we operate and the quality of properties that we own, (v) competition from other properties, (vi) inability to collect rent from tenants, (vii) increased operating costs, including labor, materials, real estate taxes, insurance premiums, and utilities, (viii) costs of complying with changes in law and government regulations including those relating to access, energy conservation and environmental matters, (ix) the relative illiquidity of real estate investments, and (x) decreases in sources of both construction and long-term lending as traditional sources of such funding leave or reduce their commitments to real estate-based lending. In addition, periods of rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate (for example, due to competition from internet sellers the demand for brick and mortar retail spaces has declined and may continue to decline, and due to the increasing popularity of tele-commuting demand for traditional office space has likewise declined and may likewise continue to decline), or the public perception that any of these events may occur, could result in declining rents or increased lease defaults. Increasing cap rates can result in lower property values.\n- 22 -\nIlliquidity of real estate investments could impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties. Real estate investments can be relatively illiquid and, therefore, tend to limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. Many of our properties are either \u201cspecial purpose\u201d properties that could not be readily converted to general residential, retail or office use. In addition, certain significant expenditures associated with real estate investment, such as real estate taxes and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment, and competitive factors may prevent the pass-through of such costs to tenants.\nReal estate development involves a variety of risks.\nReal estate development involves a variety of risks, including the following:\n\uf0b7The identification and acquisition of suitable development properties. Competition for suitable development properties is intense. Our ability to identify and acquire development properties may be limited by our size and resources. Also, as we and our affiliates are considered to be \u201cforeign owned\u201d for purposes of certain Australian and New Zealand statutes, we have been in the past, and may in the future be, subject to regulations that are not applicable to other persons doing business in those countries.\n\uf0b7The procurement of necessary land use entitlements for the project. This process can take many years, particularly if opposed by competing interests. Competitors and community groups (sometimes funded by such competitors) may object based on various factors, including, for example, impacts on density, parking, traffic, noise levels and the historic or architectural nature of the building being replaced. If they are unsuccessful at the local governmental level, they may seek recourse to the courts or other tribunals. This can delay projects and increase costs.\n\uf0b7The construction of the project on time and on budget. Construction risks include the availability and cost of financing; the availability and costs of material and labor; the costs of dealing with unknown site conditions (including addressing pollution or environmental wastes deposited upon the property by prior owners); inclement weather conditions; and the ever-present potential for labor-related disruptions.\n\uf0b7The leasing or sell-out of the project. Ultimately, there are risks involved in the leasing of a rental property or the sale of a condominium or built-for-sale property. For our ETCs, the extent to which our cinemas can continue to serve as an anchor tenant will be influenced by the same factors as will influence generally the results of our cinema operations. Leasing or sale can be influenced by economic factors that are neither known nor knowable at the commencement of the development process and by local, national, and even international economic conditions, both real and perceived.\n\uf0b7The refinancing of completed properties. Properties are often developed using relatively short-term loans. Upon completion of the project, it may be necessary to find replacement financing for these loans. This process involves risk as to the availability of such permanent or other take-out financing, the interest rates, and the payment terms applicable to such financing, which may be adversely influenced by local, national, or international factors.\nThe ownership of properties involves risk. The ownership of properties involves risks, such as: (i) ongoing leasing and re-leasing risks, (ii) ongoing financing and re-financing risks, (iii) market risks as to the multiples offered by buyers of investment properties, (iv) risks related to the ongoing compliance with changing governmental regulation (including, without limitation, laws and regulations related to access, energy conservation and environmental matters), (v) relative illiquidity compared to some other types of assets, and (vi) susceptibility of assets to uninsurable risks, such as biological, chemical or nuclear terrorism, or risks that are subject to caps tied to the concentration of such assets in certain geographic areas, such as earthquakes. Furthermore, as our properties are typically developed around an entertainment use, the attractiveness of these properties to tenants, sources of finance and real estate investors will be influenced by market perceptions of the benefits and detriments of such entertainment-type properties.\nWe may be subject to liability under environmental laws and regulations. We own and operate cinemas and other properties within the U.S. and internationally, which may be subject to various foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment or human health. Such environmental laws and regulations include those that impose liability for the investigation and remediation of spills or releases of hazardous materials. We may incur such liability, including for any currently or formerly owned, leased or operated property, or for any site, to which we may have disposed, or arranged for the disposal of, hazardous materials or wastes. Certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability, including on a joint and several liability, which can result in a liable party being obliged to pay for greater than its share, regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal. Environmental conditions relating to our properties or operations could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and cash flows.\nLegislative or regulatory initiatives related to global warming/climate change concerns may negatively impact our business. Recently, there has been an increasing focus and continuous debate on global climate change including increased attention from regulatory agencies and legislative bodies. This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an as yet unspecified array of environmental matters. Legislative, regulatory or other efforts in the U.S. to combat climate change could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials, taxes, transportation and utilities for our vendors and for us which would result in higher operating costs for the Company. Also, compliance by our cinemas and accompanying real estate with new and revised environmental, zoning, land-use or building codes, laws, rules or regulations, could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\n- 23 -\nHowever, we are unable to predict at this time, the potential effects, if any, that any future environmental initiatives may have on our business.\nChanges in interest rates may increase our interest expense. Because a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates, increases in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense. Based on our debt outstanding as of December 31, 2021, if interest rates were to increase by 1%, the corresponding increase in interest expense on our variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $2.7 million per year. Potential future increases in interest rates may therefore negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations and reduce our access to the debt or equity capital markets.\nUncertainty relating to the likely phasing out of LIBOR may result in paying increased interest under our credit facilities. Some of our variable rate indebtedness uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intended to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. LIBOR is no longer used to price new loans, and existing finance structures which are based on LIBOR are expected to be transitioned by June 2023 when certain time-based LIBOR rates will no longer be published. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect that any discontinuance, modification or other reform of LIBOR or any other reference rate, or the establishment of alternative reference rates, may have on LIBOR, other benchmarks, or LIBOR-based debt instruments. However, the use of alternative reference rates or other reforms could cause the interest rates payable under our credit facilities to be substantially higher than we would otherwise have expected.\n- 24 -\nInternational Business Risks\nOur Company transacts business in Australia and New Zealand and is subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. During the current year, the Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar strengthened against the U.S. dollar by 8.9% and 8.8%, respectively, compared to the prior year. Our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, including the following:\n\uf0b7Currency Risk: while we report our earnings and net assets in U.S. dollars, substantial portions of our revenue and of our obligations are denominated in either Australian or New Zealand dollars. The value of these currencies can vary significantly compared to the U.S. dollar and compared to each other. We do not hedge the currency risk, but rather have relied upon the natural hedges that exist as a result of the fact that our film costs are typically fixed as a percentage of the box office, and our local operating costs and obligations are likewise typically denominated in local currencies. Set forth below is a chart of the exchange ratios between these three currencies since 1996:\nIn recent periods, we have repaid intercompany debt and used the proceeds to fund capital investment in the United States. Accordingly, our debt levels in Australia are higher than they would have been if funds had not been returned for such purposes. On a company wide basis, this means that a reduction in the relative strength of the U.S. dollar versus the Australian Dollar and/or the New Zealand dollar would effectively raise the overall cost of our borrowing and capital and make it more expensive to return funds from the United States to Australia and New Zealand. In 2021, we used a portion of the proceeds of certain asset monetizations to fund liquidity needs in the United States.\n\uf0b7Risk of adverse government regulation: currently, we believe that relations between the United States, Australia, and New Zealand are good. However, no assurances can be given that these relationships will continue, and that Australia and New Zealand will not in the future seek to regulate more highly the business done by U.S. companies in their countries.\n\uf0b7Risk of adverse labor relations: deterioration in labor relations could lead to an increased cost of labor (including future government requirements with respect to pension liabilities, disability insurance and health coverage, and vacations and leave).\n- 25 -\nTrade disputes and geopolitical instability outside of the U.S. may adversely impact the U.S. and global economies.\nIn 2021, global growth weakened, trade tensions heightened, and several emerging markets experienced significant downturns as macroeconomic and geopolitical developments weighed on market sentiments. Governmental policies of developed economies, such as the U.S., have a substantial effect on emerging markets, and the consequences of a trade war between two developed countries, like that of the U.S. and China, could further contribute to the adverse economic and political conditions of emerging and other developed economies. Additionally, North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons capabilities, Chinese activities relative to the South China Sea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine continue to be an ongoing security concern and worsening relations between the U.S. and North Korea, Russia and China continue to create a global security issue that may adversely affect international business and economic conditions. While it is difficult for us to predict the effect of such trade wars and heightened geopolitical and economic instability on our business, they could lead to currency devaluation, economic and political turmoil, market volatility, and a loss of consumer confidence in the broader U.S. economy.\nRisks Associated with Certain Discontinued Operations\nCertain of our subsidiaries were previously in industrial businesses. As a consequence, properties that are currently owned or may have in the past been owned, by these subsidiaries may prove to have environmental issues. Where we have knowledge of such environmental issues and are in a position to make an assessment as to our exposure, we have established what we believe to be appropriate reserves, but we are exposed to the risk that currently unknown problems may be discovered. These subsidiaries are also exposed to potential claims related to exposure of former employees to coal dust, asbestos, and other materials now considered to be, or which in the future may be found to be, carcinogenic or otherwise injurious to health.\nOperating, Financial Structure and Borrowing Risk\nTypically, we have negative working capital. As we invest our cash in new acquisitions and the development of our existing properties, we have negative working capital. This negative working capital is typical in the cinema exhibition industry because our short-term liabilities are in part financing our long-term assets instead of long-term liabilities financing short-term assets, as is the case in other industries such as manufacturing and distribution. In addition, the new lease accounting standard requires us to include our operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. See Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-- Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Operating Leases.\nWe are subject to complex taxation, changes in tax rates, adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and disagreements with tax authorities that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are subject to many different forms of taxation in both the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate, such as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law in December 2017. The new laws are still evolving and require that we interpret the provisions of the law as we work to comply with them. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management\u2019s time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties.\nWe have substantial short- to medium-term debt. Generally speaking, we have historically financed our operations through relatively short-term debt. No assurances can be given that we will be able to refinance this debt, or if we can, that the terms will be reasonable. However, as a counterbalance to this debt, we have certain unencumbered real property assets, which could be sold to pay debt or encumbered to assist in the refinancing of existing debt, if necessary.\nWe have substantial lease liabilities. Most of our cinemas operate in leased facilities. These leases typically have \u201ccost of living\u201d or other rent adjustment features and require that we operate the properties as cinemas. The COVID-19 pandemic, increased competition from internet, streaming and cable-based entertainment, and changes in film distribution have adversely affect the ability of our cinema operating subsidiaries to meet these rental obligations. Even if our cinema exhibition business returns to pre-Pandemic levels and thereafter remains relatively constant, cinema level cash flow will likely be adversely affected unless we can increase our revenue sufficiently to offset increases in our rental liabilities.\nIf our company suffers cybersecurity attacks, data security challenges or privacy incidents that result in security breaches, we could suffer a loss of sales, additional liability, reputational harm or other adverse consequences. The effective operation of our international businesses depends on our network infrastructure, computer systems, physical, virtual and/or cloud based, and software. Our information technology systems collect and process information provided by customers, employees and vendors. In addition, third-party vendors\u2019 systems process ticketing for our theaters. These various information technology systems and the data stored within them are subject to penetration by cyber attackers. We utilize industry accepted security protocols to securely maintain and protect proprietary and confidential information. However, in spite of our best efforts, our information systems may fail to operate for a variety of technological or human reasons. An interruption or failure of our information technology systems and of those maintained by our third-party providers could adversely affect our business, liquidity or results of operations and result in increases in reputational risk, litigation or penalties. Furthermore, any such occurrence, if significant could require us to expend resources to remediate and\n- 26 -\nupgrade information technology systems. Since 2015, we have annually procured cybersecurity insurance to protect against cybersecurity risks; however, we cannot provide any assurance regarding the adequacy of such insurance coverage.\nOur stock is thinly traded. Our stock is thinly traded, with an average daily volume in 2021 of only approximately 61,032 shares of Class A Stock. Our Class B Stock is very thinly traded with even less volume. This can result in significant volatility, as demand by buyers and sellers can easily get out of balance.\nOwnership and Management Structure, Corporate Governance, and Change of Control Risks\nOngoing disputes among the heirs of James J. Cotter, Sr., over the past seven years have caused, and may continue to cause, uncertainty regarding the ongoing control of our Company by the Cotter family and have distracted and may continue to distract the time and attention of our officers and directors from our business and operations and may ultimately interfere with the effective management of the Company. Up until his death on September 13, 2014, James J. Cotter, Sr., the father of Ellen Cotter, James J. Cotter, Jr. and Margaret Cotter, was our controlling stockholder, having the sole power to vote approximately 66.9% of the outstanding Class B Voting Common Stock (the \u201cClass B Stock\u201d) of our Company. Under applicable Nevada Law, a stockholder holding two-thirds or more of our Company\u2019s Class B Stock has the power at any time, with or without cause, to remove any one or more directors (up to and including the entire board of directors) by written consent taken without a meeting of the stockholders. Over the past seven years, there have been a variety of disputes between Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter, on one side, and James J. Cotter, Jr., and/or his estate on the other side, as to the control and disposition of this Class B Stock. James Cotter, Jr., passed away on March 10, 2021. The ultimate impact of the passing of James J. Cotter, Jr., upon the currently pending disputes relating to the control of our Company is uncertain. However, our Company is advised that a settlement in principle (the \u201cSettlement in Principle\u201d) has been reached between the parties to these disputes (including with respect to the below described motions by the GAL (as defined below)), which would resolve matters amongst such parties, including, without limitation, matters pending before the Superior Court (as defined below) and the Court of Appeal of the State of California, Second Appellate District, Division Seven, as described in more detail below. The Settlement in Principle is subject to execution of definitive documentation, and because such matters involve minor beneficiaries, to the approval by the Superior Court. The Settlement in Principle is expected to result in the ongoing control of our Company by the immediate family of James J. Cotter, Sr., because the Settlement in Principle provides that Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter (in a capacity to be decided later) will acquire the shares of the Class B Stock originally designated by the terms of the Cotter Living Trust (as defined below) for the children of James J. Cotter, Jr., which if such Class B Stock could be, and were to be, distributed today would represent 674,332 shares of Class B Stock.\nEllen Cotter and Margaret Cotter, in their individual capacities and as the Co-Executors of the Estate of James J. Cotter (the \u201cCotter Estate\u201d) and as the Co-Trustees of the Living Trust established by the Declaration of Trust dated June 5, 2013, by James J. Cotter, Sr., as amended (the \u201cCotter Living Trust\u201d) currently vote approximately 72% of the outstanding Class B stock. Of this approximately 67% of such Class B Stock is held by the Cotter Estate and the Cotter Living Trust, ultimately for distribution into a voting sub-trust (the \u201cCotter Voting Trust\u201d) of the Cotter Living Trust. Margaret Cotter is the sole trustee of the Cotter Voting Trust. During his lifetime, James J. Cotter, Jr. in litigation (the \u201cTrust Case\u201d) brought in the California Superior Court for Los Angeles County (the \u201cCalifornia Superior Court\u201d), among other things, sought to have Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter removed as Trustees of the Cotter Living Trust, to have Margaret Cotter removed as the Trustee of the Cotter Voting Trust and to have the shares of Class B Stock held by the Cotter Estate, the Cotter Living Trust and/or the Cotter Voting Trust (and representing a controlling interest in our Company) sold. Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter have advised that they believe that this stock should be retained and held for as long as possible for the long-term benefit of grandchildren of James J. Cotter, Sr, as they believe is provided for in the document governing the Cotter Voting Trust and have opposed the efforts of James J. Cotter, Jr. to remove them as Trustees and to have this stock sold.\nUpon motion brought by James J. Cotter, Jr., in the Trust Case, the California Court appointed a guardian ad litem (the \u201cGAL\u201d) to represent the interests of these grandchildren (who consist of the children of Margaret Cotter and of James J. Cotter, Jr.). The GAL has motions pending (i) to divide the Cotter Voting Trust into separate trusts, one for the benefit of Margaret Cotter\u2019s children and one for the benefit of James J. Cotter, Jr.\u2019s children, (ii) in order to achieve diversification of the assets of these trusts, to sell the Class B Stock eventually to be held by these trusts, and (iii) to immediately retain a valuation expert to advise him as to value of the Class B Stock to be eventually held by the Cotter Voting Trust. These motions are opposed by Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter acting in their capacity as Executors and Trustees. A motion has also been brought by Margaret Cotter and Ellen Cotter, as Co-Trustees of the Cotter Living Trust, to disqualify the GAL on the basis that he cannot simultaneously represent the interests of Margaret Cotter and James J. Cotter\u2019s, Jr\u2019s, children as the interests of those children differ. That motion was denied by the California Superior Court and that order is currently subject to appeal.\nAs a consequence of the California Superior Court\u2019s ruling in the Trust Case that the amendment to the trust document memorializing the Cotter Living Trust supported by James J. Cotter, Jr. was not valid and that the amendment supported by Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter was the controlling document, Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter, as Co-Trustees of the Cotter Living Trust, have brought a motion to enforce the no-contest clause of the Cotter Living Trust, which if successful would remove James J. Cotter, Jr and his descendants as beneficiaries of the Cotter Living Trust. It would also moot Mr. Cotter, Jr.\u2019s motions (to the extent that they survive his passing), as he would be neither a trustee nor a beneficiary of the Cotter Living Trust. Mr. Cotter, Jr., has opposed the Co-\n- 27 -\nTrustees motion to enforce the no-contest clause and brought an Anti-SLAPP claim against the Co-Trustees. That Anti-SLAPP claim was denied by the California Superior Court, which denial is now on appeal.\nWhile our Company is not a party to the Trust Case, our Company has appeared in court, to protect (a) the business plan adopted by our Board of Directors and its determination that stockholder interests are best achieved by continuing with that business plan rather than selling our Company at this time and (b) in the event that the California Superior Court were to disregard the advice of our Board and order that a controlling interest in our Company be marketed or sold, that the interests of our Company and stockholders generally are protected in the context of any such change of control transaction. Our Company\u2019s participation in the Trust Case since August 2017 has been overseen by a Special Independent Committee of the Board of Directors currently comprised of directors Doug McEachern and Judy Codding.\nWe continue to believe that, whether or not a final determination is made to sell the voting shares, the very commencement of a process to sell a controlling interest in our Company would pose risks to our Company and our stockholders for a variety of reasons, including the resultant potential for: (i) distraction of management and key employees from focusing on the conduct of our business, including the implementation of our three year business strategy, (ii) incurrence of additional general and administrative costs due to the need to implement employee retention programs and to incur legal expenses of the type and at levels not typically required in the ordinary conduct of our Company\u2019s business, (iii) interference with contractual relationships, negotiations and potential negotiations with third parties important to our Company\u2019s business, including, without limitation, current and future lenders, tenants, landlords, suppliers and co-developers, (iv) increased difficulty in hiring and retaining high quality employees, and (v) exposure of our Company to potential litigation claims of the type which often accompany any extraordinary corporate transactions together with the expense, distraction and time loss that typically results from any such litigation. If a decision to sell a controlling interest is made by the California Superior Court, then there would be the additional risk that control might be sold to an unqualified purchaser who might exploit such control position in a manner not consistent with the best interests of our Company or stockholders generally.\nThe California Superior Court, in the Trust Case, has jurisdiction over a potentially controlling block of our voting power. Should the California Superior Court order the sale of the Class B Stock intended for transfer to the Cotter Voting Trust, and such sale be completed, then there may be a change of control of our Company (depending on, among other things, who the ultimate purchaser(s) of such shares might be, the number of shares of Class B Stock distributed by the Cotter Estate to the Cotter Living Trust, and whether the California Superior Court orders a sale of all or only some portion to the Class B Stock to be held by the Cotter Voting Trust). We cannot predict what reactions, including appeals or other steps, might be taken by Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter in their respective capacities as Trustees under the Cotter Living Trust, or in other capacities (for example, as Co-Executors of the Cotter Estate or as stockholders acting in their own right), should the California Superior Court make such an order. We do note, however, that Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter have publicly stated that, if there is to be a sale of controlling shares, they intend to be the purchasers of such shares. We also cannot predict what action our Board of Directors would take in response, if any. However, our Board of Directors has an obligation to act in the best interest of our Company, and in the event the California Superior Court were to order a sale of the Class B Stock held by the Cotter Living Trust, our Board of Directors would be obligated to consider the interests of our Company and to act accordingly.\nAs foreshadowed in the beginning of this discussion, the recent passing of James J. Cotter, Jr., has rendered uncertain the status of his petition to remove Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter as Trustees, as to the GAL\u2019s ongoing status given the differing interests of the children of Margaret Cotter and the children of James J. Cotter, Jr., and the GAL\u2019s motion to divide the Voting Trust and sell the shares of Class B Stock held by the Cotter Estate, the Cotter Living Trust and/or the Cotter Voting Trust.\nFurthermore, the uncertainty as to the future management and control of our Company could potentially adversely impact, among other things (i) our ability to develop and maintain favorable business relationships, (ii) our ability to attract and retain talented and experienced directors, executives and employees, (iii) the compensation and other terms needed to attract and retain such individuals (including, without limitation, the potential need for retentions agreements and other incentive arrangements typically put into place when control of a public company is uncertain), (iv) our ability to borrow money on favorable long-term terms, and (v) our ability to pursue and complete long-term business objectives.\nThe interests of our controlling stockholder may conflict with your interests. As of December 31, 2021, the Cotter Estate and the Cotter Living Trust beneficially owned 66.9% of our outstanding Class B Stock. At the present time, according to the books of the Company, Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter vote (including their direct holdings of 50,000 shares and 35,100 shares respectively of the Class B Stock), Class B Stock representing 71.9% of our outstanding Class B Stock. Our Class A Stock is non-voting, while our Class B Stock represents all of the voting power of our Company. For as long as the Cotter Estate, the Cotter Trust and/or the Cotter Voting Trust (referred to herein collectively as the \u201cCotter Entities\u201d) continue to own shares of Class B Stock representing more than 50% of the voting power of our common stock, the Cotter Entities will be able to elect all of the members of our Board of Directors and determine the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including matters involving mergers or other business combinations, the acquisition or disposition of assets, the incurrence of indebtedness, the issuance of any additional shares of common stock or other equity securities and the payment of dividends on common stock. The Cotter Entities will also have the power to prevent or cause a change in control and could take other actions that might be desirable to the Cotter Entities but not to other stockholders. To the extent that the Cotter Entities hold more than two-thirds of our outstanding Class B Stock, the Cotter Entities\n- 28 -\nwill have the power under Nevada law at any time, with or without cause, to remove any one or more Directors (up to and including the entire Board of Directors) by written consent taken without a meeting of the stockholders.\nIn addition, the Cotter Estate or the Cotter Living Trust and/or their respective affiliates have controlling interests in companies in related and unrelated industries. In the future, we may participate in transactions with these companies (see Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-- Note 21 - Related Parties).\nWhile controlling stockholders may owe certain fiduciary duties to our Company and/or minority stockholders, these duties are limited. No assurances can be given that the Cotter Entities will not take action that, while beneficial to them and legally enforceable, would not necessarily be in the best interests of our Company and/or our stockholders generally.\nWe are a \u201cControlled Company\u201d under applicable NASDAQ Regulations. As permitted by those Regulations, our Board has elected to opt-out of certain corporate governance rules applicable to non-controlled companies. Generally speaking, NASDAQ requires listed companies to meet certain minimum corporate governance provisions. However, a \u201cControlled Company,\u201d such as we, may elect not to be governed by certain of these provisions. Our Board of Directors has elected to exempt our Company from requirements that (i) at least a majority of our Directors be independent and (ii) nominees to our Board of Directors be nominated by a committee comprised entirely of independent Directors or by a majority of our Company\u2019s independent Directors. Notwithstanding the determination by our Board of Directors to opt-out of these NASDAQ requirements, we believe that a majority of our Board of Directors is nevertheless currently comprised of independent Directors. As a practical matter, subject to their fiduciary duties, Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter control the composition of our Board of Directors.\nWe depend on key personnel for our current and future performance. Our current and future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior management team and other key personnel. The loss or unavailability to us of any member of our senior management team or a key employee could significantly harm us. We cannot assure you that we would be able to locate or employ qualified replacements for senior management or key employees on acceptable terms. Due to the uncertainty of our control situation, the ongoing availability of these employees and our ability to replace them is uncertain.", "PERMNO": 87533, "SIC": 7830, "TIC": "RDI"}
