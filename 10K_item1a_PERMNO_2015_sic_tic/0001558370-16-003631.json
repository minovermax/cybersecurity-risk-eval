You should carefully consider the following discussion of risk factors, in its entirety, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the information in our financial statements and the related notes, and the other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. These risks, or other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial, may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Needs\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses in the future.\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. Investment in biopharmaceutical product development and commercialization is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that a product candidate will fail to gain regulatory approval or become commercially viable. We have not recognized any revenue from product sales to date, and we continue to incur significant development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. As a result, we are not profitable and have incurred losses in each period since our inception in 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we reported a net loss of $251.4 million and we had an accumulated deficit of $601.9 million as of December 31, 2015.\nAlthough we obtained approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for VARUBI\u00ae (rolapitant) tablets in September 2015 and launched VARUBI in the U.S. market during the fourth quarter of 2015, we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and these losses may increase as we continue to invest in a sales and marketing organization and other commercialization infrastructure for VARUBI and continue our development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses, our ability to generate revenues from VARUBI and any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval, including niraparib and the IV formulation of rolapitant, and the timing and amount of milestones and other required payments to third parties in connection with such approvals. If any of our product candidates, such as niraparib, fails in clinical trials or does not gain regulatory approval, or if approved, fails to achieve market acceptance, we may never become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nWe have a limited operating history, which may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nWe were incorporated in March 2010. Our operations to date have been focused on organizing and staffing our company, acquiring product and technology rights, and conducting product development activities for our product candidates. We obtained FDA approval for VARUBI in September 2015 but have very limited experience commercializing VARUBI or any of our other product candidates. Consequently, any predictions about our future success, performance or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history, approved products that have been marketed for some time, or both.\nWe have not recognized any revenues from sales of our products, and we may never become profitable.\nTo date, we have not recognized any revenues from sales of VARUBI or generated any revenues from sales of our clinical-stage product candidates. We also have not generated any revenues from the other product candidates that we have in-licensed. Our ability to generate revenue and become profitable depends upon our ability to successfully commercialize products, including VARUBI, our existing clinical-stage product candidates, including niraparib and IV rolapitant, and any other product candidates that we have or may in-license or acquire in the future. Even if we are able to successfully achieve regulatory approval for our product candidates, we do not know when any of these products will generate revenue for us, if at all. Our ability to generate revenue from VARUBI and our current or future product candidates also depends on a number of additional factors, including our ability to:\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully complete development activities, including clinical trials for niraparib;\n\u00b7\ncomplete and submit new drug applications, or NDAs, or biologic license applications, or BLAs, to the FDA and obtain regulatory approval for indications for which there is a commercial market;\n\u00b7\ncomplete and submit applications to, and obtain regulatory approval from, foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\nset a commercially viable price for our products;\n\u00b7\nobtain commercial quantities of VARUBI, IV rolapitant, niraparib, and any of our other product candidates at acceptable cost levels;\n\u00b7\ndevelop a commercial organization capable of sales, marketing and distribution;\n\u00b7\nfind suitable partners to help us market, sell and distribute our approved products; and\n\u00b7\nobtain adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including government payors.\nIn addition, because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, including the risk that our product candidates may not advance through development or achieve the endpoints of applicable clinical trials, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to complete the process described above, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing these products.\nEven if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of our products, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations.\nWe will require additional capital to fund our operations, and if we fail to obtain necessary financing, we may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to advance the clinical development of our product candidates and to launch and commercialize VARUBI and any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval in both the U.S. and in certain foreign markets, including Europe. We also expect to spend substantial amounts for any milestone obligations that may arise, and for any additional product candidates that we may in-license. We will require additional capital for these and other needs. If such additional funding is not obtained on a timely basis, we would be required to change our current operating plans to reduce our future expenses.\nUntil we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from our products, if ever, we expect to finance future cash needs through additional public or private equity or debt offerings and may seek additional capital through arrangements with strategic partners or from other sources. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of VARUBI, niraparib, or one or more of our other product candidates. Raising additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders, increased fixed payment obligations, or both. Furthermore, these securities may have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects.\nOur forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future funding requirements, both short and long-term, will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe cost of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for VARUBI and any of our product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval in the U.S. and in certain foreign markets, including Europe;\n\u00b7\nthe outcome, timing and cost of regulatory approvals by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including for niraparib and IV rolapitant, and the potential that the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require that we perform more studies than those that we currently expect;\n\u00b7\nthe initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials for our current product candidates and any future product candidates we may in-license;\n\u00b7\nthe cost and timing of completion of commercial-scale outsourced manufacturing activities, including for niraparib and IV rolapitant;\n\u00b7\nthe preclinical and clinical development plans we and our collaborator, AnaptysBio, Inc., or AnaptysBio, establish for our immuno-oncology platform;\n\u00b7\nthe likelihood and timing of attainment of milestones and our obligations to make milestone payments, royalty payments, or both under our in-licensing agreements;\n\u00b7\nthe number and characteristics of product candidates that we in-license and develop;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of potential conversion requests, if any, and interest expense associated with our 3.00% convertible senior notes due October 1, 2021, or the Convertible Notes; and\n\u00b7\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments.\nIf we lack the capital to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur future success is dependent primarily on our ability to successfully commercialize VARUBI and to obtain regulatory approvals for and successfully commercialize our portfolio of product candidates, including niraparib and IV rolapitant.\nThe success of our business depends heavily upon our ability to develop and commercialize product candidates. We have launched but not recognized any revenue on sales of VARUBI, and our only other late clinical-stage product candidates are IV rolapitant and niraparib. Our other product candidates are at earlier stages of development.\nWe cannot commercialize product candidates in the United States without first obtaining regulatory approval for the product from the FDA. Similarly, we cannot commercialize product candidates outside of the United States without obtaining regulatory approval from comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product candidate for a target indication, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence gathered in preclinical and well-controlled clinical studies, and, with respect to approval in the United States, to the satisfaction of the FDA, that the product candidate is safe and effective for use for that target indication and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate. The process to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize product candidates is long, complex and costly both inside and outside of the United States. Even if a product candidate were to successfully obtain approval from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, any approval might contain significant limitations, including use restrictions for certain patient populations; warnings, precautions or contraindications; or burdensome post-approval study or risk management requirements.\nNotwithstanding VARUBI\u2019s FDA approval, the FDA will require approval of a separate NDA for an IV formulation of rolapitant, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval of the IV formulation. To support an NDA for the IV formulation, we will have to provide data specific to the IV formulation. We expect the IV formulation of rolapitant to serve what we believe is a larger portion of the market for NK-1 receptor antagonists and potentially generate more revenue than the oral formulation. If we do not obtain regulatory approval for the IV formulation or do not obtain such approval in a timely manner, it would negatively affect our revenue and growth prospects.\nDespite the results reported in earlier clinical trials for niraparib, we do not know whether the clinical trials we are conducting or may in the future conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety, or safety to result in regulatory approval for niraparib in any particular jurisdiction or jurisdictions. If we do not obtain regulatory approval for niraparib, or do not obtain such approval in a timely manner or for anticipated patient populations, it would negatively affect our revenue and growth prospects.\nOur current business plan relies on the successful commercialization of VARUBI, which was approved by the FDA in September 2015, and VARUBI may not achieve market acceptance and may not be commercially successful.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize VARUBI, our first FDA-approved product, is important to the execution of our business strategy. VARUBI may not achieve market acceptance among physicians, patients, and third-party payors, and may not be commercially successful. The degree of market acceptance and commercial success of VARUBI will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u00b7\nmaintaining compliance with all regulatory requirements applicable to VARUBI;\n\u00b7\nthe acceptance of VARUBI by patients and the medical community and the availability, perceived advantages and relative cost, safety and efficacy of alternative and competing treatments;\n\u00b7\nthe effectiveness of our marketing, sales and distribution strategy and operations;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our third-party manufacturers to manufacture commercial supplies of VARUBI, to remain in good standing with regulatory agencies, and to develop, validate and maintain commercially viable manufacturing processes that are, to the extent required, compliant with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, regulations;\n\u00b7\nthe degree to which the approved labeling supports promotional initiatives for commercial success;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of reimbursement from managed care plans and other third-party payors and the willingness and ability of patients to pay for VARUBI;\n\u00b7\na continued acceptable safety profile of VARUBI;\n\u00b7\nany unexpected results from further analysis of clinical data of our completed clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nour ability to enforce our intellectual property rights in and to VARUBI; and\n\u00b7\nour ability to avoid third party patent interference or patent infringement claims.\nAs many of these factors are beyond our control, we cannot assure you that we will ever be able to generate meaningful revenue through the sale of VARUBI. Any inability on our part to successfully commercialize VARUBI in the United States and any foreign territories where it may be approved, or any significant delay in such approvals, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to execute upon our business strategy.\nIf we are unable to successfully establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for VARUBI or our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval, we may be unable to generate revenue from sales of our products.\nPrior to the launch of VARUBI in late 2015, we had not commercialized any drug products as a company. To achieve commercial success for VARUBI and any product candidate that may be approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, we must continue to expand our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. We will be competing with companies that currently have extensive, well-funded, and more experienced sales and marketing operations. We may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.\nWe have recently built a field organization and other capabilities for the sales, marketing and distribution of VARUBI, and there are significant risks involved with building and managing a sales organization. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to effectively commercialize VARUBI on our own include:\n\u00b7\nour inability to recruit, train, retain and incentivize adequate numbers of qualified and effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe inability of sales personnel to generate sufficient sales leads and to obtain access to physicians or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to use or prescribe VARUBI;\n\u00b7\nthe lack of complementary products currently offered by our sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u00b7\nour inability to effectively manage a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team.\nIf we are unable to establish and maintain effective sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for VARUBI and any other product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue or may not become profitable. If the cost of establishing and maintaining a sales and marketing organization exceeds the cost-effectiveness of doing so, we may not become profitable.\nWe face substantial competition for VARUBI and our product candidates, and others may discover, develop or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face substantial competition with respect to VARUBI and, if approved, our IV rolapitant product would also face substantial competition. VARUBI competes with EMEND, an NK-1 receptor antagonist marketed by Merck, as well as AKYNZEO, an oral combination NK-1 receptor antagonist and 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (netupitant plus ALOXI (palonosetron HCl)) that is marketed by Helsinn and Eisai. We are aware that Sandoz has received approval for a generic version of aprepitant that to our knowledge has not been launched commercially. VARUBI would face additional competition if such a generic version is introduced to the market or if other products were developed and approved for the treatment and prevention of CINV or if an IV formulation of AKYNZEO is developed. There are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products that we expect will compete with niraparib.\nA number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are also pursuing the development of cancer immunotherapies that may compete with our immunotherapy product candidates. We are aware of several companies that have antibody-based products on the market or in clinical development that are directed at the same biological targets as some of our collaboration programs with AnaptysBio, and several other companies with immuno-oncology antibodies or programs in the preclinical or research phase. For further detail on the specific competition that VARUBI and our product candidates face, see \u201cItem 1. Business - Competition\u201d.\nMany of the approved drugs with which our products or product candidates may compete are well established therapies or products and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products. If a generic formulation of aprepitant were to be introduced to the market, it may have a price that is lower than the price of VARUBI. If our other product candidates are approved, they may be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products. This may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy of using our product candidates in combination with existing therapies or replacing existing therapies with our product candidates.\nAs a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we are able to or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more widely used and less costly than ours, and may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, as VARUBI has, they may still face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nEven after regulatory approval is obtained, products are still subject to ongoing requirements of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including requirements related to manufacturing, quality control, further development, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, import, export, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information. The safety profile of any product will continue to be closely monitored by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities after approval. If the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities become aware of new safety information about VARUBI or of any of our product candidates after approval, those authorities may require labeling changes or establishment of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, or similar strategy, impose restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance.\nIn addition, manufacturers of drug and biological products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA, other regulatory authorities or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP requirements. If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. If we, our approved products or product candidates, or the manufacturing facilities for our approved products or product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u00b7\nissue warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u00b7\nmandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners;\n\u00b7\nrequire us to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance;\n\u00b7\nseek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u00b7\nsuspend, vary or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u00b7\nsuspend any ongoing clinical studies;\n\u00b7\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us;\n\u00b7\nsuspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; and\n\u00b7\nseize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or require us to initiate a product recall.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenue.\nAdvertising and promotion of VARUBI and any product candidate that obtains approval in the United States will be heavily scrutinized by the FDA, the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Inspector General, state attorneys general, members of Congress, and the public. Violations of applicable advertising and promotion laws and regulations, including promotion of our products for unapproved (or off-label) uses, are subject to enforcement letters,\ninquiries and investigations, and civil and criminal sanctions by the FDA. Advertising and promotion of any product candidate that obtains approval outside of the United States will be heavily scrutinized by comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nIn the United States, engaging in impermissible promotion of approved products, such as VARUBI, for off-label uses can also subject us to false claims litigation under federal and state statutes, which can lead to civil and criminal penalties and fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. These false claims statutes include the federal civil False Claims Act, which allows any individual to bring a lawsuit against a pharmaceutical company on behalf of the federal government alleging submission of false or fraudulent claims, or causing to present such false or fraudulent claims, for payment of government funds, and the individual could share in any judgment or settlement funds. Since 2004, False Claims Act lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies have led to several substantial civil and criminal settlements based on certain sales practices promoting off-label drug uses. This growth in litigation has increased the risk that a pharmaceutical company will have to defend a false claim action, pay treble damages and penalties, or agree to comply with burdensome reporting and compliance obligations pursuant to a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General to avoid exclusion from the Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal and state healthcare programs. We may become subject to such litigation and, if we are not successful in defending against such actions, those actions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Equivalent laws and potential consequences exist in foreign jurisdictions.\nBecause the results of preclinical testing or earlier clinical studies are not necessarily predictive of future results, niraparib, which is in Phase 3 clinical trials, or any other product candidate we advance into clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials or receive regulatory approval.\nSuccess in preclinical testing and early clinical studies does not ensure that later clinical trials will generate adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of an investigational drug, or the safety, purity, and potency of an investigational biological product. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including many with greater resources and experience than us, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical trials. Despite the results reported in earlier clinical trials for niraparib, we do not know whether the clinical trials we are conducting or may in the future conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety, or safety to result in regulatory approval for niraparib in any particular jurisdiction or jurisdictions. If we do not obtain regulatory approval for niraparib, or do not obtain such approval in a timely manner or for anticipated patient populations, it would negatively affect our revenue and growth prospects.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process.\nWe have various ongoing clinical trials related to our development programs for IV rolapitant and niraparib. We may experience delays in our ongoing or future clinical trials, and we do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin or enroll subjects on time, need to be redesigned, or be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials may be delayed, suspended or prematurely terminated for a variety of reasons, such as:\n\u00b7\ndelay or failure in reaching agreement with the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority on a trial design that we are able to execute;\n\u00b7\ndelay or failure in obtaining authorization to commence a trial or inability to comply with conditions imposed by a regulatory authority regarding the scope or design of a clinical study;\n\u00b7\ndelay or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u00b7\ndelay or failure in obtaining institutional review board, or IRB, approval or the approval of other reviewing entities, including comparable foreign entities, to conduct a clinical trial at each site;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawal of clinical trial sites from our clinical trials as a result of changing standards of care or the ineligibility of a site to participate in our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\ndelay or failure in recruiting and enrolling suitable subjects to participate in a trial;\n\u00b7\ndelay or failure in having subjects complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u00b7\nclinical sites and investigators deviating from trial protocol, failing to conduct the trial in accordance with regulatory requirements, or dropping out of a trial;\n\u00b7\ninability to identify and maintain a sufficient number of trial sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial programs, including some that may be for the same indication;\n\u00b7\nfailure of our third-party CROs, clinical sites, or clinical trial managers to satisfy their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines;\n\u00b7\nambiguous or negative interim results, or results that are inconsistent with earlier results;\n\u00b7\nfeedback from the FDA, an IRB, a data safety monitoring board, or comparable foreign entities; or results from earlier stage or concurrent preclinical and clinical studies, that might require modification to the protocol for a given study;\n\u00b7\na decision by the FDA, an IRB, comparable foreign regulatory entities, or the Company; or a recommendation by a data safety monitoring board or comparable foreign regulatory entity, to suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for safety issues or for any other reason;\n\u00b7\nunacceptable risk-benefit profile or unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects;\n\u00b7\nfailure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug or biologic;\n\u00b7\nmanufacturing issues, including problems with manufacturing or obtaining from third parties sufficient quantities of raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients or product candidates for use in clinical trials; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nPatient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of subjects to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, the ability to obtain and maintain patient consents, whether enrolled subjects drop out before completion, competing clinical trials, and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. Furthermore, we rely on CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and while we have agreements governing their activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance.\nIf we experience delays in the completion of, or the termination of, any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process, and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, including niraparib and IV rolapitant, our business will be substantially harmed.\nThe time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for a product candidate is unpredictable, but typically takes many years following the commencement of preclinical studies and clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. Although we have obtained FDA regulatory approval for VARUBI, it is possible that none of our current product candidates, including niraparib and IV rolapitant, or any product candidates we may in-license or acquire and seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval.\nOur product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval from the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7\ndisagreement with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nfailure to demonstrate that a product candidate is safe and effective, or safe, pure, and potent, for its proposed indication;\n\u00b7\nfailure of clinical trial results to meet the level of statistical significance required for approval;\n\u00b7\nfailure to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u00b7\ndisagreement with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe insufficiency of data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates to support the submission and filing of an NDA, BLA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval;\n\u00b7\ndisapproval of the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with whom we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in approval policies or regulations that render our preclinical and clinical data insufficient for approval.\nThe FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may require more information, including additional preclinical or clinical data, to support approval, which may delay or prevent approval and our commercialization plans, or we may decide to abandon the development program. If we were to obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve any of our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve a product candidate with a label that is not desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate. In addition, if our product candidate produces undesirable side effects or safety issues, the FDA may require the establishment of a REMS, or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may require the establishment of similar strategies, that may, for instance, restrict distribution of our product or otherwise impose burdensome implementation requirements on us. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects of our product candidates.\nVARUBI or any of our product candidates, including niraparib or IV rolapitant, may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent its regulatory approval, limit its commercial viability, or result in significant negative consequences following any marketing approval.\nUndesirable side effects caused by VARUBI or our product candidates, including niraparib and IV rolapitant, could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials, could result in a more restrictive label, or could result in the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authority. Drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled subjects to complete a clinical trial, and could result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nAdditionally, if one or more of our product candidates receives marketing approval, as VARUBI has, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u00b7\nwe may suspend marketing of such product;\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product;\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label for such product;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to develop a REMS for such product or, if a REMS is already in place, to incorporate additional requirements under the REMS, or to develop a similar strategy as required by a comparable foreign regulatory authority;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to conduct additional post-market studies;\n\u00b7\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to subjects or patients; or\n\u00b7\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product or product candidate, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval in international jurisdictions would prevent our product candidates from being marketed abroad.\nIn order to market and sell any of our product candidates in the European Union and other jurisdictions, including China, we must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. In the EU, certain products or product candidates with which niraparib may compete have received \u201corphan drug designation\u201d from the EMA in an ovarian cancer indication, which provides certain benefits to such competitors, including market exclusivity for up to ten years in the approved indication post-approval. We will have to overcome those designations by demonstrating that niraparib is not a similar medicinal product, does not have the same therapeutic indication, or is clinically superior to the products that have received the orphan drug designation in order to obtain approval to market niraparib in the EU. We or our licensees may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market. If we are unable to obtain approval of any of our product candidates by regulatory authorities in the European Union, China or other countries, the commercial prospects of that product candidate may be significantly diminished and our business prospects could decline.\nVARUBI, as well as any product candidates we are able to commercialize, may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which could harm our business.\nOur ability to successfully market VARUBI and commercialize other products, including niraparib and IV rolapitant, will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Our future revenues and profitability will be adversely affected if these third-party payors do not sufficiently cover and reimburse the cost of our products and related procedures or services. If these entities do not provide sufficient coverage and reimbursement for VARUBI, or any future drug product we may market, including niraparib and IV rolapitant, these products may be too costly for general use, and physicians may prescribe them less frequently.\nThe Medicare program and certain government pricing programs, including the Medicaid drug rebate program, the Public Health Service\u2019s 340B drug pricing program, or the 340B program, and the pricing program under the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, or the VHCA, impact the revenues we may derive from VARUBI and other future products that we may commercialize, including niraparib and IV rolapitant. Any future legislation or regulatory actions altering these programs or imposing new compliance requirements could have a significant adverse effect on our business. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory actions and proposals to control and reduce health care costs. These measures may, among other things: negatively impact the level of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products; require higher levels of cost-sharing by beneficiaries; change the discounts required to be provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers to government payors and/or providers; extend government discounts to additional government programs and/or providers; or reduce the level of reimbursement for health care services and other non-drug items. Any such measures could indirectly impact demand for pharmaceutical products because they can cause payors and providers to apply heightened scrutiny and/or austerity actions to their entire operations, including pharmacy budgets.\nAlso, the trend toward managed health care in the U.S., as well as the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, together the Affordable Care Act, and the concurrent growth of organizations such as managed care organizations, accountable care organizations and integrated delivery networks, may result in increased pricing pressures for pharmaceutical products, including any products that may be offered by us in the future. Cost-cutting measures that health care providers are instituting, and the implementation of health care reform, could materially adversely affect our ability to sell any drug products that are successfully developed or acquired by us. In addition, third-party payors, in an effort to control costs, are increasingly making patients responsible for a higher percentage of the total cost of drugs in the outpatient setting. This can lower the demand for our products if the increased patient cost sharing obligations are more than they can afford. Individual states\u2019 responses to ongoing financial pressures could also result in measures designed to limit reimbursement, restrict access, or impose broader or deeper discounts on branded pharmaceutical products utilized for Medicaid patients, including VARUBI, or any future drug product we may market, including niraparib and IV rolapitant. We are unable to predict what additional legislation or regulation, if any, relating to the health care industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation or regulation would have on our business.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for VARUBI and other newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacturing, selling and distribution costs. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may only be temporary.\nIf we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under U.S. governmental pricing and contracting programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nPricing and rebate calculations vary among products and programs. The calculations are complex and are often subject to interpretation by manufacturers, governmental or regulatory agencies, and the courts. We will be required to submit a number of different pricing calculations, and failure to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under U.S. governmental pricing and contracting programs may have material adverse effects on the company.\nThe Medicaid rebate amount for each manufacturer is computed each quarter based on the manufacturer\u2019s submission to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, of its current average manufacturer price, or AMP, and, in the case of innovator products like VARUBI, best price figures, for the quarter. If we become aware that our AMP or best price reporting for a prior quarter was incorrect, or has changed, we are obligated to resubmit the corrected data for a period not to exceed twelve quarters from the quarter in which the data originally were due. Such restatements and recalculations would increase our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing the Medicaid drug rebate program. Any corrections to our rebate calculations could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the nature of the correction. Price recalculations also may affect the ceiling price at which we would be required to offer our products to certain covered entities, such as safety-net providers, under the 340B program.\nWe are liable for errors associated with our submission of average sales price, or ASP, pricing data under Medicare Part B. In addition to retroactive rebates and the potential for 340B program refunds, if we are found to have knowingly\nsubmitted false AMP, ASP, or best price information to the government, we may be liable for civil monetary penalties in the amount of $100,000 per item of false information. If we are found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of our ASP, the Medicare statute provides for civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each misrepresentation for each day in which the misrepresentation was applied. Our failure to submit monthly/quarterly AMP, ASP, and best price data on a timely basis could result in a civil monetary penalty of $10,000 per day for each day the information is late beyond the due date. Such failure also could be grounds for CMS to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, pursuant to which we participate in the Medicaid program. In the event that CMS terminates our rebate agreement, federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs. Governmental agencies may also make changes in program interpretations, requirements or conditions of participation, some of which may have implications for amounts previously estimated or paid.\nWe are required to calculate and report certain pricing data to the U.S. federal government in connection with federal drug pricing programs. Compliance with these federal drug pricing programs is a pre-condition to: (i) the availability of federal funds to pay for our products under Medicaid and Medicare Part B; and (ii) procurement of our products by the Department of Veterans Affairs, or the VA, and by covered entities under the 340B program. The pricing data reported are used as the basis for establishing Federal Supply Schedules, or FSS, drug pricing program and 340B program contract pricing and payment and rebate rates under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs, respectively. Pharmaceutical manufacturers have been prosecuted under federal and state false claims laws for submitting inaccurate and/or incomplete pricing information to the government, which has resulted in overcharges or underpayments under these programs. The rules governing the calculation of certain reported prices are highly complex. Although it is our intention to maintain and follow strict procedures to ensure the maximum possible integrity for our federal price calculations, the process for making the required calculations involves subjective judgments and the risk of errors always exists, which creates the potential for exposure under the false claims laws. We cannot assure you that our pricing submissions will not be found to be incomplete or incorrect. If we become subject to investigations or other inquiries concerning our compliance with price reporting laws and regulations, and our methodologies for calculating federal prices are found to include flaws or to have been incorrectly applied, we could be required to pay or be subject to additional reimbursements, penalties, sanctions or fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo be eligible to have our products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs as well as to be purchased by certain federal agencies and certain federal grantees, we also must participate in the VA FSS pricing program. To participate, we are required to enter into an FSS contract with the VA, under which we must make our innovator \u201ccovered drugs\u201d available to the \u201cBig Four\u201d federal agencies-the VA, the Department of Defense, the Public Health Service, and the Coast Guard-at pricing that is capped pursuant to a statutory federal ceiling price, or FCP, formula set forth in Section 603 of the VHCA. The FCP is based on a weighted average wholesaler price known as the Non-FAMP, which manufacturers are required to report on a quarterly and annual basis to the VA. If we misstate Non-FAMPs or FCPs, we must restate these figures. Additionally, pursuant to the VHCA, knowing provision of false information in connection with a Non-FAMP filing can subject us to penalties of $100,000 for each item of false information. If we overcharge the government in connection with our FSS contract or the Tricare Retail Pharmacy Program, whether due to a misstated FCP or otherwise, we are required to refund the difference to the government. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges can result in allegations against us under the False Claims Act and other laws and regulations. Unexpected refunds to the government, and responding to a government investigation or enforcement action, would be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur relationships with customers and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, exclusion, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, specialty distributors, specialty pharmacies, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the distribution, recommendation and prescription of any pharmaceutical product for which we obtain marketing approval. Our arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements through which we market, sell and distribute VARUBI and any other products for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:\n\u00b7\nthe federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any person from, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to\ninduce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending of any good or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The term \u201cremuneration\u201d has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretation and has been applied by government enforcement officials to a number of common business arrangements in the pharmaceutical industry. The government can establish a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute without proving that a person or entity had actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. There are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution; however, those exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute, but the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on the totality of the facts and circumstances. We seek to comply with the exemptions and safe harbors whenever possible, but our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants or patient assistance programs;\n\u00b7\nthe federal civil False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, and provides for whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment of government funds that are false or fraudulent, or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In recent years, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have faced enforcement actions under the federal False Claims Act for, among other things, allegedly submitting false or misleading pricing information to government health care programs and providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have faced enforcement actions for causing false claims to be submitted because of the company\u2019s marketing the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. Federal enforcement agencies also have showed increased interest in pharmaceutical companies\u2019 product and patient assistance programs, including reimbursement and co-pay support services, and a number of investigations into these programs have resulted in significant civil and criminal settlements. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. False Claims Act liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and mandatory penalties of $5,500 to $11,000 per false claim or statement. Because of the potential for large monetary exposure, healthcare and pharmaceutical companies often resolve allegations without admissions of liability for significant and material amounts to avoid the uncertainty of treble damages and per claim penalties that may awarded in litigation proceedings. Companies may be required, however, to enter into corporate integrity agreements with the government, which may impose substantial costs on companies to ensure compliance. Criminal prosecution is also possible for making or presenting a false or fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, among other things, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA also prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, imposes annual reporting requirements on certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, or biologics for payments and other transfers of value by them, directly or indirectly, to physicians (including physician family members) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians. A manufacturer\u2019s failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of\nvalue or ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year, and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for \u201cknowing failures.\u201d Manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each calendar year;\n\u00b7\nanalogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. Several states also require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products in those states and to report gifts and payments to individual health care providers in those states. Some of these states also prohibit certain marketing-related activities, including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers. In addition, several states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes; and\n\u00b7\nsimilar restrictions imposed on the promotion and marketing of medicinal products in the EU and other countries, including restrictions prohibiting the promotion of a compound prior to its approval. Laws (including those governing promotion and marketing and anti-kickback provisions), industry regulations and professional codes of conduct often are strictly enforced. Even in those countries where we may decide not to directly promote or market our products, inappropriate activity by our any international distribution partners could have implications for us.\nThe shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare or pharmaceutical company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations or guidance. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our financial condition and divert resources and the attention of our management from operating our business.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our products and generate revenues outside of the U.S. depends heavily on the availability of adequate pricing and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.\nOutside the U.S., certain countries, including a number of EU Member States, set prices and reimbursement for pharmaceutical products, or medicinal products as they are commonly referred to in the EU, with limited participation from the marketing authorization holders. We cannot be sure that such prices and reimbursement will be acceptable to us or our collaborators. If the regulatory authorities in these foreign jurisdictions set prices or reimbursement levels that are not commercially attractive for us or our collaborators, our revenues from sales by us or our collaborators, and the potential profitability of our drug products, in those countries would be negatively affected. An increasing number of countries are taking initiatives to attempt to reduce large budget deficits by focusing cost-cutting efforts on pharmaceuticals for their state-run health care systems. These international price control efforts have impacted all regions of the world, but have been most drastic in the EU.\nAdditionally, some countries require approval of the sale price of a product before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, which could negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that particular country.\nRecently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and may affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and foreign jurisdictions, legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.\nIn recent years, Congress has considered reductions in Medicare reimbursement levels for drugs administered by physicians. CMS also has authority to revise reimbursement rates and to implement coverage restrictions for some drugs. Cost reduction initiatives and changes in coverage implemented through legislation or regulation could decrease utilization of and reimbursement for any approved products, which in turn would affect the price we can receive for those products. While Medicare regulations apply only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from federal legislation or regulation may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nThe Affordable Care Act substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms. The Affordable Care Act expanded manufacturers\u2019 rebate liability under the Medicaid program from fee-for-service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well; increased the minimum Medicaid rebate due for most innovator drugs in general from 15.1% of AMP to 23.1% of AMP; and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of AMP. The Affordable Care Act and subsequent legislation also changed the definition of AMP. The Affordable Care Act requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs to pay a branded prescription drug fee to the federal government. Each such manufacturer pays a prorated share of the branded prescription drug fee of $3.0 billion in 2016, based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to certain federal programs identified in the law. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may affect our business practices with healthcare practitioners. The Affordable Care Act also expanded the 340B program to include additional types of covered entities. On February 1, 2016, CMS issued final regulations to implement the changes to the Medicaid drug rebate program under the Affordable Care Act. These regulations become effective on April 1, 2016. We are evaluating the impact of these regulations on our business and operations. It appears likely that the Affordable Care Act will continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. Beginning April 1, 2013, Medicare payments for all items and services, including drugs and biologics, were reduced by 2% under the sequestration (i.e., automatic spending reductions) required by the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Subsequent legislation extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2025. If Congress does not take action in the future to modify these sequestrations, Medicare Part D plans could seek to reduce their negotiated prices for drugs. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for our products, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.\nWe cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes (or in some instances current regulations, guidance or interpretations) on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be.\nIf we breach the license agreements for our products or product candidates, we could lose the ability to continue the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nOur agreements with our licensors, including OPKO, Merck, and AnaptysBio, require us, among other things, to use diligent or commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the products and product candidates licensed thereunder, make timely milestone, royalty and other payments, provide certain information regarding our activities with respect to such products and product candidates, maintain the confidentiality of information we receive thereunder, and indemnify our licensors with respect to our development and commercialization activities under the terms of the agreements. If we fail to meet these obligations, our licensors have the right to terminate our exclusive licenses and re-obtain the licensed technology as well as aspects of any intellectual property controlled by us and developed during the period the agreements were in force that relate to the licensed technology. This means that our licensors could effectively take control of the\ndevelopment and commercialization of our products and product candidates after an uncured, material breach of our license agreements by us. This would also generally be the case if we voluntarily terminated the agreements. While we would expect to exercise all rights and remedies available to us, including seeking to cure any breach by us, and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under the patents licensed to us, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, at an acceptable cost or at all. Any uncured, material breach under the licenses could result in our loss of exclusive rights and may lead to a complete termination of our product development and any commercialization efforts for the applicable product or product candidate.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining necessary rights to product candidates for our development pipeline through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nWe do not intend to develop product candidates from our own original research. Our business model is predicated, in part, on our ability to successfully identify and acquire or in-license product candidates for the treatment and support of cancer patients. However, we may be unable to acquire or in-license any product candidates from third parties for various reasons, including because we are focusing on a specific area of care, and we may be unable to identify product candidates that we believe are an appropriate strategic fit for our company.\nThe in-licensing and acquisition of product candidates is a competitive area, and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to in-license or acquire product candidates that we may consider attractive. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, financial resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. Furthermore, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to in-license or acquire the relevant product candidate on terms that would allow us to generate an appropriate return on our investment.\nIn addition, we expect that competition for the in-licensing or acquisition of product candidates that are attractive to us may increase in the future, which may mean fewer suitable opportunities for us as well as higher acquisition or licensing prices. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to suitable product candidates, our business, financial condition and prospects for growth could suffer.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and could limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk with the commercialization of VARUBI or any of our current or future product candidates. Product liability claims may be brought against us by subjects enrolled in our clinical trials, patients, healthcare providers or others using, administering or selling our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7\ndecreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n\u00b7\ntermination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n\u00b7\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7\nsignificant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u00b7\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial subjects or patients;\n\u00b7\nloss of revenue;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations; and\n\u00b7\nthe inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nWe currently hold what we believe to be a commercially reasonable amount of product liability insurance coverage, which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us, particularly if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could consume significant amounts of our cash and adversely affect our business.\nWe intend to market our products outside of the United States, and we will be subject to the risks of doing business outside of the United States.\nBecause we intend to market VARUBI and our product candidates, if approved, outside of the United States, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States. Accordingly, our business and financial results in the future could be adversely affected due to a variety of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nefforts to develop an international sales, marketing and distribution organization may increase our expenses, divert our management\u2019s attention from the acquisition or development of product candidates or cause us to forgo profitable licensing opportunities in these geographies;\n\u00b7\nchanges in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political and cultural climate or economic condition;\n\u00b7\nunexpected changes in foreign laws and regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty of effective enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions;\n\u00b7\ninadequate intellectual property protection in foreign countries;\n\u00b7\ntrade-protection measures, import or export licensing requirements such as Export Administration Regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Commerce and fines, penalties or suspension or revocation of export privileges;\n\u00b7\nthe effects of applicable foreign tax structures and potentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\u00b7\nsignificant adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nIn addition to FDA and related regulatory requirements in the U.S. and abroad, we are subject to extensive additional federal, state and foreign anti-bribery regulation, which include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar laws in other countries outside of the U.S. We have developed and implemented a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are current best practices in the pharmaceutical industry for companies similar to ours, but we cannot guarantee that we, our employees, our consultants or our third-party contractors are or will be in compliance with all federal, state and foreign regulations regarding bribery and corruption. Moreover, our partners and third party contractors located outside the U.S. may have inadequate compliance programs or may fail to respect the laws and guidance of the territories in which they operate. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities, failure to provide accurate information to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, failure to comply with manufacturing standards, failure to comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable foreign regulatory authorities, failure to report financial information or data accurately, violations of anti-bribery laws, or failure to disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide\nrange of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of confidential information obtained in the course of our business, which could result in civil or criminal legal actions, regulatory sanctions, or serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other corporate policies, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nWe will need to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 286 full-time employees compared to 108 at the end of December 2014. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, or as a result of any in-licenses or acquisitions of new product candidates, we will continue to need additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other resources. Our management, personnel and systems currently in place may not be adequate to support our recent or future growth. Such growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including:\n\u00b7\nexpanding and maintaining a sales and marketing organization and developing our distribution capabilities;\n\u00b7\nidentifying, recruiting, maintaining, motivating and integrating additional employees;\n\u00b7\nmanaging our internal development efforts effectively while complying with our contractual obligations to licensors, licensees, contractors and other third parties;\n\u00b7\nimproving our managerial, development, operational and finance systems; and\n\u00b7\nexpanding our facilities.\nAs our operations expand, we will need to manage additional relationships with various strategic partners, suppliers and other third parties. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize VARUBI and our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to manage our development efforts, including our clinical trials, effectively and hire, train and integrate additional management, administrative and sales and marketing personnel. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could prevent us from successfully growing our company.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nOur future growth and success depend on our ability to recruit, retain, manage and motivate our employees. Because of the specialized scientific and managerial nature of our business, we rely heavily on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel. Our ability to compete and grow depends in large part upon the continued service of our senior management team. In particular, the loss of one or more of our senior executive officers could be detrimental to us if we cannot recruit suitable replacements in a timely manner. The competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is intense and as a result, we may be unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to recruit suitable replacement personnel.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain our co-founding executive officers.\nWe are highly dependent on Leon O. Moulder, Jr., our Chief Executive Officer, and Mary Lynne Hedley, Ph.D., our President and Chief Operating Officer. Although we have offer letter agreements with Mr. Moulder and Dr. Hedley, these agreements are at-will and do not prevent them from terminating their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any of our executives or other employees. The loss of the services of either of these persons could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nIn addition to in-licensing or acquiring product candidates, we may engage in future acquisitions that could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders and harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWhile we currently have no specific plans to acquire any other businesses, we have, from time to time, evaluated acquisition opportunities and may, in the future, make acquisitions of, or investments in, companies that we believe have products or capabilities that are a strategic or commercial fit with our current product candidates and business or otherwise offer opportunities for our company. In connection with these acquisitions or investments, we may:\n\u00b7\nissue stock that would dilute our stockholders\u2019 percentage of ownership;\n\u00b7\nincur debt and assume liabilities; and/or\n\u00b7\nincur amortization expenses related to intangible assets or incur large and immediate write-offs.\nWe may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete an acquisition, we cannot assure you that it will ultimately strengthen our competitive position or that it will not be viewed negatively by customers, financial markets or investors. Further, future acquisitions could also pose numerous additional risks to our operations, including:\n\u00b7\nproblems integrating the purchased business, products or technologies;\n\u00b7\nincreases to our expenses;\n\u00b7\nthe failure to have discovered undisclosed liabilities of the acquired asset or company;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from their day-to-day responsibilities;\n\u00b7\nharm to our operating results or financial condition;\n\u00b7\nentrance into markets in which we have limited or no prior experience; and\n\u00b7\npotential loss of key employees, particularly those of the acquired entity.\nWe may not be able to complete one or more acquisitions or effectively integrate the operations, products or personnel gained through any such acquisition without a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur therapeutic product candidates, including niraparib, may be approved only in combination with companion diagnostics to support certain uses. We may have difficulty receiving approval for or adoption of our therapeutic product candidates for those uses from FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies, or may have difficulty achieving adoption of our product candidates, if applicable companion diagnostics are not commercially available, or are restricted in their use by payors or other market forces.\nFor certain of our cancer therapeutic product candidates, including niraparib, we believe certain diagnostic tests or specific clinical criteria will allow us to identify cancer patients who will be more likely to respond to the drug. We plan to rely on diagnostic tests to help us more accurately identify patients with those criteria both during our clinical trials and in connection with the commercialization of certain of our product candidates, including niraparib. Diagnostic tests, including companion diagnostics, are subject to regulation by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities as medical devices and require separate regulatory approval prior to commercialization. We do not develop diagnostic tests internally. We are therefore dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of third-party collaborators in developing and obtaining approval for these tests. For example, our niraparib product candidate will use a test owned and administered by a third party to identify breast cancer patients with a BRCA gene mutation during clinical testing. We are also evaluating niraparib in patients with certain homologous recombinant deficiency, or HRD, scores. The test to determine this HRD score is owned and administered by the same third party that administers the BRCA gene mutation test. Therefore, it is possible that niraparib will be approved for these indications only in combination with one of these diagnostic tests. This third party may encounter difficulties in developing and obtaining approval for its test, or may fail to support the clinical development of niraparib for breast cancer as\nwe expect, or may fail to keep the test on the market even if it is approved. Any such delay or failure could delay or prevent approval or adoption of niraparib, or other products we may later acquire with similar characteristics.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of our collaborators, our CROs and other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liabilities and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nOur failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, and adversely impact our operating results.\nWe are subject to U.S. data protection laws and regulations (i.e., laws and regulations that address privacy and data security) at both the federal and state levels. The legislative and regulatory landscape for data protection continues to evolve, and in recent years there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data security issues. Numerous federal and state laws, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, and disclosure of health-related and other personal information. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties (e.g., healthcare providers who prescribe our products) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA-other than potentially with respect to providing certain employee benefits-we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. Finally, a data breach affecting sensitive personal information, including health information, could result in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational damages that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.\nEU Member States, Switzerland and other countries have also adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. For example, the collection and use of personal health data in the European Union is governed by the provisions of the EU Data Protection Directive, or the Directive. The Directive and the national implementing legislation of the EU Member States impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. In particular, these obligations and restrictions concern the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. Data protection authorities from the different EU Member States may interpret the Directive and national laws differently and impose additional requirements, which add to the complexity of processing personal data in the EU.\nGuidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised. For example, the EU Data Protection Directive prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the European Economic Area, or EEA, that are not considered by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of data protection. These countries include the United States. A recent judgment by the Court of Justice of the European Union determined the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework, which was relied upon by many U.S. entities as a basis for transfer of personal data from the European Union to the U.S., to be invalid. U.S. entities therefore must use alternate procedures for such data transfer. In addition, the EU Data Protection Regulation, intended to replace the current Data Protection Directive, which will be officially adopted in the first quarter of 2016 and applicable two years after its publication in the Official Journal for the European Union, will introduce new data protection requirements in the EU and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. The EU Data Protection Regulation will increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new data protection rules.\nOur failure to comply with these laws, or changes in the way in which these laws are implemented, could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, and adversely impact our operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe have no manufacturing facility, and we are dependent on a limited number of third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of VARUBI and our product candidates, as well as on a number of third parties for our supply chain. If we experience problems with any of these third parties, the manufacturing of VARUBI or our product candidates could be delayed, which could harm our ability to generate revenues from our approved products, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, and our results of operations.\nWe do not own or operate facilities for the manufacture of VARUBI or our product candidates. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. We currently work with one contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, Hovione, for the production of rolapitant drug substance used for VARUBI and IV rolapitant, and one other CMO, Patheon, for commercial production of VARUBI. We also currently work with a CMO for the production of IV rolapitant drug product for clinical use.\nAs our drug development pipeline matures and we continue to commercialize VARUBI and, if approved, our other product candidates, including niraparib and IV rolapitant, we will have a greater need for clinical study and commercial manufacturing capacity. We have limited experience manufacturing pharmaceutical products on a commercial scale, and some of our suppliers will need to increase their scale of production to meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing. For example, to meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing of VARUBI, Patheon will need to increase scale of production. The development of commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities may require our third-party manufacturers to invest substantial additional funds and hire and retain the technical personnel who have the necessary manufacturing experience. Our third-party manufacturers may not successfully complete any required increase to existing manufacturing capacity in a timely manner, or at all. Because of the complex nature of our compounds, our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture our compounds at an acceptable cost or in sufficient quantities or in a timely manner necessary to make commercially successful products, or may require us to pay significant costs, including for capital improvements to their facilities. Therefore, successful commercialization of VARUBI or any of our product candidates, including niraparib and IV rolapitant, may require us to establish large-scale commercial manufacturing capabilities. If our contract manufacturers or other third parties fail to deliver VARUBI and our potential future products, including niraparib and IV rolapitant, for commercial sale on a timely basis, with sufficient quality, and at commercially reasonable prices, and we fail to find replacement manufacturers or to develop our own manufacturing capabilities, we may be required to delay or suspend commercialization of VARUBI or our other potential future products.\nExisting inventory for niraparib drug substance and drug product from Merck provided the initial clinical trial material needed for our niraparib clinical program. We have agreements in place with CMOs for the further production of niraparib to meet our clinical supply needs. For preclinical development of our immuno-oncology antibody product candidates, we currently work with one CMO for the production of biologics. For each of our product candidates, we may elect to pursue arrangements with other CMOs for manufacturing clinical supplies for later-stage trials and for commercialization. We have not yet qualified alternate suppliers in the event the current CMOs we utilize are unable to scale production, or if we otherwise experience any problems with them. If we are unable to arrange for alternative third-party manufacturing sources, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner, we may not be able to complete development of our product candidates, or market or distribute them.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured product candidates or products ourselves, including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, the possibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control (including a failure to synthesize and manufacture our product candidates or any products we may eventually commercialize in accordance with our specifications) and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or damaging to us. In addition, the FDA and similar foreign authorities require that our product candidates and approved products, such as VARUBI, be manufactured according to cGMP and similar foreign standards. Any failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with cGMP or failure to scale up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities of product candidates in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval of any of our product candidates. In addition, such failure could be the basis for the FDA or an equivalent foreign regulatory authority to issue a warning or untitled letter, withdraw approvals for product candidates previously granted to us, or take other regulatory or legal action, including recall or seizure, total or partial suspension of production, suspension of ongoing clinical trials, refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, detention of product, refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunction, or imposition of civil and criminal penalties.\nAny significant disruption in our supplier relationships could harm our business. We source key materials from third parties, either directly through agreements with suppliers or indirectly through our manufacturers who have agreements with suppliers. There are a small number of suppliers for certain capital equipment and key materials that are used to manufacture our drug products and product candidates. Such suppliers may not sell these key materials to our manufacturers at the times we need them or on commercially reasonable terms. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these key materials by our manufacturers. Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these key materials. Any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate or its key materials for an ongoing clinical study could considerably delay completion of our clinical studies, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates. If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these key materials for VARUBI or for our product candidates after regulatory approval, the commercial launch of our product candidates could be delayed or there could be a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of VARUBI or our product candidates.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or commercialize, our product candidates, and our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe rely upon AnaptysBio to discover and conduct preclinical research and development on antibody product candidates targeting PD-1, TIM-3 and LAG-3 in accordance with the research programs that we jointly establish for those candidates. Although we participate in the planning of these programs, we do not directly control the amount or timing of resources devoted by AnaptysBio to activities related to these product candidates. AnaptysBio may not commit sufficient resources to our research and development programs for these candidates. If AnaptysBio fails to commit sufficient resources to any of our antibody product candidates, our preclinical programs related to the candidate could be delayed, terminated, or unsuccessful. Furthermore, if we fail to make required payments to AnaptysBio, including up-front, milestone, reimbursement or royalty payments, or to observe other obligations in our agreement with AnaptysBio, AnaptysBio may not be required to perform its obligations under the agreement and may have the right to terminate the agreement.\nWe also have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon third-party CROs to monitor and manage data for our ongoing preclinical and clinical programs. We rely on these parties for execution of our preclinical and clinical trials, and we control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on collaborators and CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We also rely on these third parties to assist in conducting our preclinical studies in accordance with good laboratory practices and Animal Welfare Act requirements. We and our collaborators and CROs are required to comply with good clinical practices, or GCP, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the competent authorities of the member countries of the EEA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our products in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce GCP through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our collaborators or CROs fail to comply with applicable GCP, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials complies with GCP requirements. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP requirements. Failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat preclinical and clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process and our ability to generate and grow revenues.\nAnaptysBio and our CROs are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing clinical, nonclinical and preclinical programs. If our collaborators and CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our preclinical and clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nBecause we have relied and plan to continue to rely on third parties for the foregoing preclinical and clinical functions, our internal capacity to perform these functions is limited. Outsourcing these functions involves risks that third parties may not perform to our standards, may not produce results in a timely manner, or may fail to perform at all. In addition, the use of third-party service providers requires us to disclose our proprietary information to these parties, which could increase the risk that this information will be misappropriated. We have a limited number of employees, which limits the internal\nresources we have available to identify and monitor our third-party providers. To the extent we are unable to identify and successfully manage the performance of third-party service providers in the future, our business may be adversely affected. Although we carefully manage our relationships with AnaptysBio and our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nIf we lose our relationships with CROs, our drug development efforts could be delayed.\nWe rely on third-party vendors and CROs for preclinical studies and clinical trials related to our drug development efforts. Switching or adding additional CROs involves additional cost, requires management time and focus, and could result in substantial delays in our development programs. Our CROs have the right to terminate their agreements with us in the event of an uncured material breach. In addition, some of our CROs have an ability to terminate their respective agreements with us if it can be reasonably demonstrated that the safety of the subjects participating in our clinical trials warrants such termination, if we make a general assignment for the benefit of our creditors, or if we are liquidated. Identifying, qualifying and managing the performance of third-party service providers can be difficult, time consuming and cause delays in our development programs. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work and the new CRO may not provide the same type or level of services as the original provider. If any of our relationships with our third-party CROs terminates, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or do so on commercially reasonable terms.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed, and we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights.\nWe depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, and confidentiality, licensing and other agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. Where we have the right to do so under our license agreements, we seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and products that are important to our business. The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally are highly uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions and have in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patents, including those patent rights licensed to us by third parties, are highly uncertain.\nThe steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, both inside and outside the United States. The rights already granted under any of our currently issued patents and those that may be granted under future issued patents may not provide us with the proprietary protection or competitive advantages we are seeking. If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficient, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or superior to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected. Further, under our agreement with Merck for niraparib, Merck is responsible, subject to certain exceptions, for prosecuting the licensed patents, and we are reliant on them to do so in a diligent fashion, subject to our right to review and approve their prosecution activities. If Merck fails to conduct such activities diligently, does not take approved actions, or otherwise fails to adequately protect our licensed patent rights, we may not obtain or maintain broad proprietary protection for niraparib. Similarly, under our agreement with AnaptysBio, during preclinical development of our antibody product candidates, AnaptysBio has primary responsibility for prosecuting certain licensed patents at our expense, subject in certain circumstances to our right to prior approval of expenses. If AnaptysBio fails to conduct such activities diligently, does not take approved actions, or otherwise fails to adequately protect our licensed patent rights, we may not obtain or maintain broad proprietary protection for antibody product candidates targeting PD-1, TIM-3 and LAG-3.\nWith respect to patent rights, we do not know whether any of the pending patent applications for any of our licensed compounds will result in the issuance of patents that protect our technology or products, or whether they will effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Although we have a number of issued patents under our licensing agreements covering our technology, our pending applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications. Further, the examination process may require us or, in the case of niraparib and our antibody product candidates during preclinical\ndevelopment, our licensor, to narrow the claims, which may limit the scope of patent protection that may be obtained. Because the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, issued patents that we own or have licensed from third parties may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in the loss of patent protection, the narrowing of claims in such patents, or the invalidity or unenforceability of such patents, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection for our technology and products. Protecting against the unauthorized use of our patented technology, trademarks and other intellectual property rights is expensive, difficult and, may in some cases not be possible. In some cases, it may be difficult or impossible to detect third-party infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, even in relation to issued patent claims, and proving any such infringement may be even more difficult.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we, or in the case of niraparib and our antibody product candidates during preclinical development, our licensor, may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we or our licensors will fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of our development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. Further, given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. We expect to seek extensions of patent terms where they are available in any countries where we are prosecuting patents. This includes in the United States under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, which permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. However the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, and any equivalent regulatory authority in other countries, may not agree with our assessment of whether such extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents, or may grant more limited extensions than we request. If this occurs, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our investment in development and clinical trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and these foreign laws may also be subject to change. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions typically are not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions.\nPreviously, in the United States, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first to make the claimed invention was entitled to the patent. Outside the United States, the first to file a patent application is entitled to the patent. In March 2013, the United States transitioned to a \u2018first to file\u2019 system in which the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent. Under either the previous or current system, third parties will be allowed to submit prior art prior to the issuance of a patent by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and may become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter-partes review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, which could adversely affect our competitive position with respect to third parties.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of our own intellectual property rights or the proprietary rights of others. This can be expensive and time consuming. Many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to defend their intellectual property rights than we can. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, which could harm our business and financial results. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent owned by or licensed to us is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates, and to use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology, including interference proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. If we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and commercializing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, in any such proceeding or litigation, we could be found liable for monetary damages. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Any claims by third parties that we have misappropriated their confidential information or trade secrets could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nMany of our employees, including our senior management, were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Some of these employees, including members of our senior management, executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements in connection with such previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. We are not aware of any threatened or pending claims related to these matters or concerning the agreements with our senior management, but in the future litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property disputes could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical personnel, management personnel, or both, from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and products, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the\noutcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts both within and outside the United States may be less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using that technology or information to compete with us, which could harm our competitive position.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our common stock is highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Since our initial public offering, which occurred in June 2012, the price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market has ranged from $11.05 per share to $66.95 per share. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, these factors include:\n\u00b7\nthe success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u00b7\nregulatory actions with respect to our products or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u00b7\nresults of clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nregulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs;\n\u00b7\nthe results of our efforts to in-license or acquire additional product candidates or products;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u00b7\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u00b7\nannouncement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u00b7\nsales of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u00b7\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the NASDAQ Global Select Market and biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the\noperating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The realization of any of the above risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in these \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nForecasting sales of VARUBI may be difficult, and if our revenue projections are inaccurate, our business may be harmed and our stock price may decline.\nOur sales of VARUBI will be difficult to forecast. Factors that increase the difficulty of forecasting sales of VARUBI include the following:\n\u00b7\nthe cost and availability of reimbursement for the product;\n\u00b7\ntreatment guidelines issued by government and non-government agencies;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of market entry relative to competitive products;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of alternative therapies;\n\u00b7\nthe price of VARUBI relative to alternative therapies, including generic versions of products that compete with our product;\n\u00b7\nthe rates of returns and rebates;\n\u00b7\nuncertainty about the pace of acceptance of VARUBI;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our third-party manufacturers to manufacture and deliver VARUBI in commercially sufficient quantities;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our third-party distributors in the United States to process orders in a timely manner and satisfy their obligations to us;\n\u00b7\nthe extent and success of our marketing efforts; and\n\u00b7\npotential side effects or unfavorable publicity concerning our product or similar products.\nThe extent to which any of these or other factors individually or in the aggregate may impact future sales of VARUBI is uncertain and difficult to predict. Our management must make forecasting decisions regarding future revenue in the course of business planning despite this uncertainty, and actual results of operations may deviate materially from projected results. If our revenues from VARUBI sales are lower than we anticipate, we will incur costs in the short term that will result in losses that are unavoidable. A shortfall in revenue would have a direct impact on our expected cash flow, our stock price and on our business generally. Furthermore, to the extent that any projections we disclosed publicly regarding future sales of VARUBI or our financial performance are incorrect, including as a result of the challenges in forecasting sales of VARUBI, our stock price could be adversely affected, and we could be subject to an increased risk of litigation. In addition, fluctuations in our quarterly results can adversely and significantly affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, and in the past, some companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and are collectively able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nOur executive officers, directors and their or our respective affiliates beneficially owned approximately 34.4% of our voting stock as of December 31, 2015. This group of stockholders has the potential ability to control us through their ownership position. Acting together, these stockholders may be able to determine the outcomes of certain matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, this group may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders. The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders, and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, including seeking a premium value for their common stock, and might affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. We are required, under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish an annual report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also generally requires an attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nOur compliance with Section 404 requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We have limited experience complying with Section 404, and if in the future we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the NASDAQ, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nWe are incurring increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nWe incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses as a public company, and these expenses will increase even more as our compliance obligations increase, including as a result of the requirement to obtain an attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act, as well as rules adopted, and to be adopted, by the SEC and the NASDAQ Stock Market. Our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have substantially increased, and will continue to increase, our legal and financial compliance costs and have made and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. These increased costs have increased, and will continue to increase, our consolidated net loss. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain sufficient coverage. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we have 40,279,783 shares of common stock outstanding. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other securities in the public market or in private placements could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. Of these outstanding shares, 13,865,010 are currently held by directors, executive officers and other parties that may be deemed to be their or our affiliates and are available for sale subject to volume limitations, other restrictions under securities laws and, in some cases, vesting schedules. We also have registered shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates.\nFurthermore, certain persons who were stockholders prior to our initial public offering are entitled to registration rights under the Securities Act of 1933, or the Securities Act, with respect to shares they hold, which includes 12,727,272 shares held by our directors, executive officers and other parties that may be deemed to be their or our affiliates. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in such shares becoming freely tradable without restrictions under the Securities Act, except with respect to shares purchased by affiliates. Any sales of shares by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nWe are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements or insufficient disclosure due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe expect that we will need significant additional capital in the future to continue our planned operations. To raise capital, we may sell substantial amounts of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock. These future issuances of common stock or common stock-related securities, together with the exercise of outstanding stock options and any additional shares issued in connection with acquisitions, if any, may result in material dilution to our investors. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.\nPursuant to our equity incentive plans, our compensation committee is authorized to grant equity-based incentive awards to our directors, executive officers and other employees and service providers, including officers, employees and service providers of our subsidiaries and affiliates. The initial number of shares of our common stock available for future grant under our 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan, or the 2012 Incentive Plan, which became effective in April 2012, was 1,428,571 plus the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our 2010 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 2010 Incentive Plan, as of the effective date of the 2012 Incentive Plan (which is an additional 6,857 shares). On May 14, 2015, our stockholders approved an additional 2,000,000 shares for issuance under our 2012 Incentive Plan. The number of shares of our\ncommon stock reserved for issuance under our 2012 Incentive Plan will be increased (i) from time to time by the number of shares of our common stock forfeited upon the expiration, cancellation, forfeiture, cash settlement or other termination of awards under our 2010 Incentive Plan following the effective date of the 2012 Incentive Plan, and (ii) on January 1 of each year, by a number of shares of common stock equal to the lesser of (x) 4% of the shares of common stock outstanding at such time, or (y) the number of shares determined by our board of directors. As of December 31, 2015, there were 1,437,159 shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our 2012 Incentive Plan. On May 14, 2015, our stockholders approved our 2015 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan, or the 2015 Director Plan. The number of shares of our common stock available for future grant under our 2015 Director Plan is 411,571. Future stock option grants and issuances of common stock under our equity plans may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, or remove our current management. These provisions include:\n\u00b7\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;\n\u00b7\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow for less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u00b7\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u00b7\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u00b7\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management. Because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nServicing our debt will require significant amounts of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, to pay any cash due upon conversion of, or to refinance, our indebtedness, including the Convertible Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nDespite our current debt levels, we may still incur additional debt. If we incur substantial additional debt, these higher levels of debt may affect our ability to pay the principal of and interest on the Convertible Notes.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, some of which may be secured debt. The indenture governing the Convertible Notes does not restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. If we incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, these higher levels of indebtedness may affect our ability to pay the principal of and interest on the Convertible Notes, or any fundamental change in purchase price or any cash due upon conversion, and our creditworthiness generally.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of notes will be entitled to convert their notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, unless we satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than cash in lieu of any fractional share), we would be required to settle all or a portion of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Convertible Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nPursuant to Accounting Standards Codification Subtopic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, which we refer to as ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Convertible Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital caption of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Convertible Notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Convertible Notes to their face amount over the term of the Convertible Notes. We will report greater losses in our financial statements because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the Convertible Notes.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Convertible Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nTo the extent we issue shares of our common stock to satisfy all or a portion of our conversion obligation, conversions of the Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders.\nUpon conversion of the Convertible Notes, we have the option to pay or deliver, as the case may be, either cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. To the extent we issue shares of our common stock to satisfy all or a portion of our conversion obligation, the conversion of some or all of the Convertible Notes will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Convertible Notes could depress the price of our common stock.\nThe fundamental change purchase feature of the Convertible Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our Company.\nThe terms of the Convertible Notes require us to offer to purchase the Convertible Notes for cash in the event of a fundamental change. A non-stock takeover of our Company may trigger the requirement that we purchase the Convertible Notes. This feature may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our Company that would otherwise be beneficial to investors.", "PERMNO": 13456, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "TSRO"}
