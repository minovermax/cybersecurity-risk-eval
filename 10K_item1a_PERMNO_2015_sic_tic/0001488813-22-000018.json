Risk Factors\nSummary of Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks and a summary of the significant risk factors is set forth below. These risks are discussed in more detail following this summary and should be read together with this summary and considered along with other information contained in this report before investing in our securities.\n\u2022Risks related to the Bancorp's banking operations:\n\u25e6Risks associated with our lending activities and effective management of credit risks in our loan and lease portfolio;\n\u25e6Risks related to maintaining an appropriate level of ACL;\n\u25e6Risks associated with our investment securities portfolio including market and credit risks and the uncertainties surrounding macroeconomic conditions;\n\u25e6Risks related to planned changes in the composition of our loan portfolio including our emphasis on commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, consumer, and mortgage warehouse lending;\n\u25e6Risks associated with maintaining sufficient liquidity including our ability to gather, grow and retain our lower cost deposits;\n\u25e6Risks and uncertainties associated with the effectiveness of our business strategies, operations, and technology in managing growth and maintaining profitability;\n\u25e6Risks related to changes to estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing financial statements.

Our failure to comply with such laws and regulations or to adequately address any matters identified during these examinations could materially and adversely affect us;\n\u25e6Risks related to reviews performed by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities for the fiscal years that remain open for investigation and potential changes in U.S. federal, state or local tax laws;\n\u2022Risks related to our securities:\n\u25e6Risks related to our voting common stock;\n\u25e6Risks related to our fixed-to-floating-rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series E and Series F; and\n\u25e6Risks related to our senior notes and subordinated notes.\n\u2022General risk factors\nRisks Related to the Bancorp\u2019s Banking Operations\nOur business is highly susceptible to credit risk. If our ACL is insufficient to absorb losses in our loan and lease portfolio, our earnings could decrease.\nLending money is a substantial part of our business, and each loan and lease carries a certain risk that it will not be repaid in accordance with its terms or that any underlying collateral will not be sufficient to assure repayment. This risk is affected by, among other things:\n\u2022the financial condition and cash flows of the borrower and/or the project being financed;\n\u2022whether a loan is collateralized and, if so, the changes and uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral, in the case of a collateralized loan or lease;\n\u2022the discount on the loan at the time of its acquisition;\n\u2022the duration of the loan or lease;\n\u2022the credit history of a particular borrower; and\n\u2022changes in current and future economic and industry conditions.\nOur credit standards, policies and procedures are designed to reduce the risk of credit losses to a low level but may not prevent us from incurring substantial credit losses.\nAdditionally, we may restructure originated or acquired loans if we believe the borrowers are experiencing problems servicing the debt pursuant to current terms, and we believe the borrower is likely to fully repay their restructured obligations. We may also be subject to legal or regulatory requirements for restructured loans. With respect to restructured loans, we may grant concessions to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties in order to facilitate repayment of the loan by a reduction of the stated interest rate for the remaining life of the loan to lower than the current market rate for new loans with similar risk or an extension of the maturity date.\nManagement makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan and lease portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the probability of our borrowers making payments, as well as the value of real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans and leases. As described in \"NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\" to our audited financial statements, on January 1, 2020, Customers adopted ASC 326, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (\"ASC 326\"), which replaced the \"incurred loss\" model for recognizing credit losses with an \"expected loss\" model referred to as the CECL model. The adoption resulted in an increase of $79.8 million to the beginning balance of our ACL. Under the CECL model, we are required to present certain financial assets carried at\namortized cost, such as loans held for investment and HTM debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the incurred loss model required under previous GAAP, which delayed recognition until it was probable a loss had been incurred. The CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our reserves. At December 31, 2021, Customers' ACL totaled $137.8 million, which represented 1.53% of total loans and leases held for investment (excluding loans receivable, mortgage warehouse at fair value and loan receivable, PPP), a non-GAAP measure. Management believes the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity when assessing Customers' financial results. These disclosures should not be viewed as substitutes for results determined to be in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other entities. Please refer to the reconciliation schedules in \"Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, LOANS AND LEASES, Credit Risk.\"\nIn determining the amount of the ACL, significant factors considered include loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio, trends and absolute levels of classified and criticized loans and leases, trends and absolute levels in delinquent loans and leases, trends in risk ratings, trends in industry and Customers' charge-offs by particular segments and changes in current and future economic and business conditions affecting our lending areas and the national economy, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. If our assumptions are incorrect, our ACL may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio, resulting in additions to the ACL.\nManagement reviews and re-estimates the ACL quarterly. Additions to our ACL as a result of management's reviews and re-estimates could materially decrease net income. Our regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our ACL and may lead us to increase our ACL by recognizing additional provisions for credit losses on loans and leases charged to expense, or to decrease our ACL by recognizing charge-offs, net of recoveries. Any such additional provisions for credit losses on loans and leases or net charge-offs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and possible risk-based capital.\nIn first quarter 2020, as part of its response to the impact of COVID-19, the U.S. federal banking regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that provided the option to temporarily delay certain effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period. The interim final rule allows banking organizations to delay for two years 100% of the day-one impact of adopting CECL and 25% of the cumulative change in the reported allowance for credit losses since adopting CECL. We elected to adopt the interim final rule.\nPlanned changes in the composition of our loan portfolio may expose us to increased lending risks.\nWe intend to continue emphasizing the origination of commercial loans, including specialty loans, loans to mortgage banking businesses and loans to consumers including the purchase of loan portfolios from third party originators or fintech companies. Our focus will be on funding commercial and industrial and consumer loan growth with excess deposits and the forgiveness of PPP loans. Changes in the composition of our loan portfolio could have a significant adverse effect on our overall credit profile, which could result in a higher percentage of non-accrual loans, increased provision for loan losses, and an increased level of net charge-offs, all of which could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Consumer loans are particularly affected by economic conditions, including interest rates, the rate of unemployment, housing prices, the level of consumer confidence, changes in consumer spending, and the number of personal bankruptcies. A weakening in business or economic conditions, including higher unemployment levels, increased interest rates or declines in home prices could adversely affect borrowers' ability to repay their loans, which could negatively impact our credit performance.\nAs of December 31, 2021, Customers had $2.1 billion in consumer loans outstanding, or 14.7% of the total loan and lease portfolio, which includes loans held for sale and loans receivable, mortgage warehouse at fair value and loans receivable, PPP, compared to $1.6 billion, or 10.3% of the total loan and lease portfolio, as of December 31, 2020.\nOur emphasis on commercial, commercial real estate and mortgage warehouse lending may expose us to increased lending risks.\nWe intend to continue emphasizing the origination of commercial loans and specialty loans, including loans to mortgage banking businesses. Commercial loans, including commercial real estate loans, can expose a lender to risk of non-payment and loss because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of a business or property and the borrower\u2019s cash flows. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one-to-four-family residential mortgage loans. In addition, we may need to increase our allowance for credit losses in the future to account for an increase in expected credit losses associated with such loans. Also, we expect that many of our commercial borrowers will have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one-to-four-family residential mortgage loan.\nAs a lender to mortgage banking businesses, we provide financing to mortgage bankers by purchasing, subject to resale under a master repurchase agreement, the underlying residential mortgages on a short-term basis pending the ultimate sale of the mortgages to investors. We are subject to the risks associated with such lending, including, but not limited to, the risks of fraud, bankruptcy and possible default by the borrower, closing agents and the residential borrower on the underlying mortgage, any of which could result in credit losses. The risk of fraud associated with this type of lending includes, but is not limited to, settlement process risks, the risk of financing nonexistent loans or fictitious mortgage loan transactions, or the risk that collateral delivered is fraudulent or non-existent, creating a risk of loss of the full amount financed on the underlying residential mortgage loan, or in the settlement processes. Fraudulent transactions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur lending to commercial mortgage businesses is a significant part of our assets and earnings. This business is subject to seasonality of the mortgage lending business, and volumes are likely to decline if interest rates increase, generally. A decline in the rate of growth, volume or profitability of this business unit, or a loss of its leadership could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $12.4 billion in commercial loans outstanding, approximately 85.3% of our total loan and lease portfolio, which includes loans held for sale and loans receivable, mortgage warehouse at fair value and loans receivable, PPP, as compared to $14.2 billion, or 89.8% of the total loan and lease portfolio, as of December 31, 2020.\nOur New York State multi-family loan portfolio could be adversely impacted by changes in legislation or regulation.\nOn June 14, 2019, the New York State legislature passed the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, impacting about one million rent regulated apartment units. Among other things, the legislation: (i) curtailed rent increases from Material Capital Improvements and Individual Apartment Improvements; (ii) all but eliminated the ability for apartments to exit rent regulation; (iii) eliminated vacancy decontrol and high-income deregulation; and (iv) repealed the 20% vacancy bonus. In total, it generally limits a landlord's ability to increase rents on rent regulated apartments and makes it more difficult to convert rent regulated apartments to market rate apartments. As a result, the value of the collateral located in New York State securing our multi-family loans or the future net operating income of such properties could potentially become impaired. At December 31, 2021, our total multi-family exposure in New York State was approximately $685.3 million, of which approximately $543.9 million, or 79.4%, was provided for loans to rent regulated properties in the multi-family community, primarily in New York City.\nThe fair value of our investment securities can fluctuate due to market conditions. Adverse economic performance can lead to adverse security performance and potential impairment.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the fair value of our investment securities portfolio was $3.8 billion. We have historically followed a conservative investment strategy, with concentrations in securities that are backed by government-sponsored enterprises. Since 2020, we have been seeking to increase yields through more aggressive strategies, which has included a greater percentage of corporate securities, non-agency mortgage-backed securities and other structured credit products. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions in respect of the securities, defaults by the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities, and changes in market interest rates and continued instability in the capital markets. Any of these factors, among others, such as a change in management's intent to sell the securities, could cause credit losses and realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods and declines in OCI, which could have a material adverse effect on us. The process for determining whether impairment of a security exists usually requires complex, subjective judgments about the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security.\nChanges to estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing financial statements could adversely affect our business, operating results, reported assets and liabilities, financial condition and capital levels.\nChanges to estimates and assumptions made by management in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods. Changes to management\u2019s assumptions or estimates could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, reported assets and liabilities, financial condition and capital levels.\nChanges in accounting standards and policies can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial results.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, the FASB or the SEC changes the financial accounting and reporting standards or the policies that govern the\npreparation of our financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. We could be required to apply new or revised guidance retrospectively, which may result in the revision of prior period financial statements by material amounts. The implementation of new or revised accounting guidance could have a material adverse effect on our financial results or net worth. For example, we adopted ASC 326 on January 1, 2020 which replaced the incurred loss methodology for determining our provision for credit losses and the ACL with the CECL model. As discussed above, our adoption of CECL resulted in an increase to our ACL of $79.8 million. The impact of CECL in future periods will be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of our loan and lease portfolio, as well as the current economic conditions and forecasts of macroeconomic variables utilized. Should these factors materially change, we may be required to increase or decrease our ACL which will impact our reported earnings thereby introducing additional volatility into our reported earnings.\nThe geographic concentration in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions makes our business susceptible to downturns in the local economies and depressed banking markets, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe have experienced exponential growth over the last two years as a result of participating in the SBA's PPP loans, and expanded our franchise in new geographies such as Texas, Florida and North Carolina. We intend to grow in these new markets and enter additional markets in the future. At December 31, 2021, our loan and deposit activities remained largely based in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. As a result, our financial performance depends in part upon economic conditions in these regions. These regions have experienced deteriorating local economic conditions in the past, and a downturn in the regional real estate market could harm our financial condition and results of operations because of the geographic concentration of loans within these regions, and because a large percentage of the loans are secured by real property. If there is a decline in real estate values, the collateral value for our loans will decrease, and our probability of incurring losses will increase as the ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate will be lessened. We expect our loan and deposit activities to continue expanding beyond the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions to service customers across the nation.\nAdditionally, we have made a significant investment in commercial real estate loans. Often in a commercial real estate transaction, repayment of the loan is dependent on the property generating sufficient rental income to service the loan. Economic conditions may affect a tenant\u2019s ability to make rental payments on a timely basis, and may cause some tenants not to renew their leases, each of which may impact the debtor\u2019s ability to make loan payments. Further, if expenses associated with commercial properties increase dramatically, a tenant\u2019s ability to repay, and therefore the debtor\u2019s ability to make timely loan payments, could be adversely affected. All of these factors could increase the amount of NPLs, increase our provision for loan losses and reduce our net income.\nWe depend on our executive officers and key personnel to implement our strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services.\nWe believe that the implementation of our strategy will depend in large part on the skills of our executive management team, and our ability to motivate and retain these and other key personnel. Accordingly, the loss of service of one or more of our executive officers or key personnel could reduce our ability to successfully implement our growth strategy and materially and adversely affect us. Leadership changes will occur from time to time, and if significant resignations occur, we may not be able to recruit additional qualified personnel. We believe our executive management team possesses valuable knowledge about the banking industry and that their knowledge and relationships would be very difficult to replicate. Although our CEO, CFO, and President have entered into employment agreements with us, it is possible that they may not complete the term of their employment agreement or may choose not to renew it upon expiration.\nOur customers also rely on us to deliver personalized financial services. Our strategic model is dependent upon relationship managers and private bankers who act as a customer\u2019s single point of contact to us. The loss of the service of these individuals could undermine the confidence of our customers in our ability to provide such personalized services. We need to continue to attract and retain these individuals and to recruit other qualified individuals to ensure continued growth. In addition, competitors may recruit these individuals in light of the value of the individuals\u2019 relationships with their customers and communities, and we may not be able to retain such relationships absent the individuals. In any case, if we are unable to attract and retain our relationship managers and private bankers and recruit individuals with appropriate skills and knowledge to support our business, our growth strategy, business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, our ability to expand into new business lines, such as digital currency through our CBIT offerings, are highly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain key personnel. We cannot assure you that our recruiting efforts for these positions will be successful or that they will enhance our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur success also depends on the experience of our branch managers and lending officers and on their relationships with the customers and communities they serve. The loss of these key personnel could negatively impact our banking operations. The loss of key senior personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, such as those in our compliance, risk and legal departments, could have a material adverse effect on us. Because many of our team members continue to work remotely on a \u201chybrid model\u201d, the ability of our key personnel and other management to motivate personnel and maintain corporate culture may be adversely affected.\nWe face significant competition from other financial institutions and financial services providers, which may materially and adversely affect us.\nCommercial and consumer banking is highly competitive. Changes in market interest rates and pricing decisions by our loan competitors may adversely affect demand for our loan products and the revenue realized on the sale of loans, and ultimately reduce our net income. Our markets contain a large number of community and regional banks as well as a significant presence of the country\u2019s largest commercial banks. We compete with other state and national financial institutions, including savings and loan associations, savings banks and credit unions, for deposits and loans. In addition, we compete with financial intermediaries, such as consumer finance companies, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, securities firms, mutual funds and several government agencies, as well as major retailers and fintechs, in providing various types of loans and other financial services. Some of these competitors may have a long history of successful operations in our markets, greater ties to local businesses and more expansive banking relationships, as well as better established depositor bases. Competitors may also have greater resources and access to capital and may possess other advantages such as operating more ATMs and conducting extensive promotional and advertising campaigns or operating a more developed Internet platform. Competitors may also exhibit a greater tolerance for risk and behave more aggressively with respect to pricing in order to increase their market share.\nWe expect to drive organic growth by employing our Concierge Banking\u00ae and single-point-of-contact strategies, which provide specific relationship managers or private bankers for all customers. Many of our competitors provide similar services, and others may replicate our model. Our competitors may have greater resources than we do and may be able to provide similar services more quickly, efficiently and extensively. To the extent others replicate our model, we could lose what we view as a competitive advantage, and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Increased competition among financial services companies due to the recent consolidation of certain competing financial institutions may adversely affect our ability to market our products and services. Technological advances have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for banks to compete in our market without a retail footprint by offering competitive rates, as well as non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among others:\n\u2022the ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on high quality, personal service, effective and efficient products and services, high ethical standards and safe and sound assets;\n\u2022the scope, relevance and competitive pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands;\n\u2022the ability to provide customers with maximum convenience of access to services and availability of banking representatives;\n\u2022the ability to attract and retain highly qualified team members to operate our business;\n\u2022the ability to expand our market position;\n\u2022customer access to our decision makers and customer satisfaction with our level of service; and\n\u2022the ability to operate our business effectively and efficiently.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nIn addition, the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services including internet services, cryptocurrencies and payment systems. In addition to improving the ability to serve customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce long-term costs. These technological advancements also have made it possible for non-financial institutions, such as the \"fintech companies\" and marketplace lenders, to offer products and services that have traditionally been offered by financial institutions. The process of \"disintermediation,\" or removing banks from their traditional role as financial intermediaries, could result in loss of customer deposits and other sources of revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, in many cases fintech companies and similar non-bank financial service firms, unlike the Bank, are not subject to extensive regulation and supervision. The absence of significant oversight and regulatory compliance obligations may allow such companies to realize certain competitive advantages over us, which may result in increased competition for our customers' business. Federal and state banking agencies continue to deliberate over the regulatory treatment of fintech companies, including whether the agencies are authorized to grant charters or licenses to such companies and whether it would be appropriate to do so in consideration of several regulatory and economic factors. The increased demand for, and availability of, alternative payment systems and currencies not only increases competition for such services, but has created a more complex operating environment that, in certain cases, may require additional or different controls to manage fraud, operational, legal and compliance risks.\nLike other financial services institutions, our asset and liability structures are monetary in nature. Such structures are affected by a variety of factors, including changes in interest rates, which can impact the value of financial instruments held by us.\nLike other financial services institutions, we have asset and liability structures that are essentially monetary in nature and are directly affected by many factors, including domestic and international economic and political conditions, broad trends in business and finance, legislation and regulation affecting the national and international business and financial communities, monetary and fiscal policies, inflation, currency values, market conditions, the availability and terms (including cost) of short-term or long-term funding and capital, the credit capacity or perceived creditworthiness of customers and counterparties and the level and volatility of trading markets. Such factors can impact customers and counterparties of a financial services institution and may impact the value of financial instruments held by a financial services institution.\nOur earnings and cash flows largely depend upon the level of our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on loans, investments and other interest earning assets, and the interest we pay on interest bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Because different types of assets and liabilities may react differently and at different times to market interest-rate changes, changes in interest rates can increase or decrease our net interest income. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest-earning assets in a period, an increase in interest rates would reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly, and because the magnitude of repricing of interest-earning assets is often greater than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates would reduce net interest income.\nAccordingly, changes in the level of market interest rates affect our net yield on interest-earning assets and liabilities, loan and investment securities portfolios and our overall financial results. Changes in interest rates may also have a significant impact on any future loan origination revenues. Changes in interest rates also have a significant impact on the carrying value of a significant percentage of the assets, both loans and investment securities, on our balance sheet. We have incurred debt and may incur additional debt in the future, and that debt may also be sensitive to interest rates and any increase in interest rates could materially and adversely affect us. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. Adverse changes in the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest-rate policies or other changes in monetary policies and economic conditions could materially and adversely affect us.\nUncertainty about the future of LIBOR may adversely affect our business.\nLIBOR is the reference rate used for many of our transactions, including our lending and borrowing and our purchase and sale of securities that we use to manage risk related to such transactions. However, a reduced volume of interbank unsecured term borrowing coupled with recent legal and regulatory proceedings related to rate manipulation by certain financial institutions has led to international reconsideration of LIBOR as a financial benchmark. The FCA, which regulates the process for establishing LIBOR, announced in July 2017 that the sustainability of LIBOR cannot be guaranteed. The administrator for LIBOR announced on March 5, 2021 that it will permanently cease to publish most LIBOR settings beginning on January 1, 2022 and cease to publish the overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month USD LIBOR settings on July 1, 2023. Accordingly, the FCA has stated that it does not intend to persuade or compel banks to submit to LIBOR after such respective dates. Until such time, however, FCA panel banks have agreed to continue to support LIBOR.\nIn October 2021, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a Joint Statement on Managing the LIBOR Transition. In that guidance, the agencies offered their regulatory expectations and outlined potential supervisory and enforcement consequences for banks that fail to adequately plan for and implement the transition away from LIBOR. The failure to properly transition away from LIBOR may result in increased supervisory scrutiny.\nWe have adopted a variety of interest rates to replace LIBOR in our financial instruments going forward, including the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate, the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index and others. We are in the process of managing this transition, facilitating communication with our customers and counterparties, and monitoring the impacts of this transition. The discontinuance of LIBOR may result in uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instruments and may also increase operational and other risks to Customers and the industry.\nThe market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on Customers' business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, any such transition could:\n\u2022adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, and the revenue and expenses associated with Customers' floating rate obligations, loans, deposits and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR's role in determining market interest rates globally;\n\u2022adversely affect the value of Customers' floating rate obligations, loans, deposits and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally;\n\u2022prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of Customers' preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate;\n\u2022result in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based securities; and\n\u2022require the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition our risk management processes from LIBOR-based products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmark,\nIn addition, the implementation of LIBOR reform proposals may result in increased compliance costs and operational costs, including costs related to continued participation in LIBOR and the transition to a replacement reference rate or rates. We cannot reasonably estimate the expected cost.\nWe launched CBIT, a blockchain-based instant payments platform, the development, acceptance and success of which is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate.\nOn October 18, 2021, Customers Bank launched CBIT on the TassatPay blockchain-based instant B2B payments platform, which serves a growing array of B2B clients who want the benefit of instant payments: including key over-the-counter desks, exchanges, liquidity providers, market makers, funds, and B2B verticals such as trading operations, real estate, manufacturing, and logistics. CBIT may only be created by, transferred to and redeemed by commercial customers of Customers Bank on the TassatPay instant B2B payments platform. CBIT is not listed or traded on any digital currency exchange. As of December 31, 2021, Customers Bank held $1.9 billion of deposits from new customers participating in CBIT. These new customers are primarily concentrated in the digital currency industry.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services including internet services, cryptocurrencies and payment systems. In addition to improving the ability to serve clients, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce long-term costs. These technological advancements also have made it possible for non-financial institutions, such as \"fintech companies\" and marketplace lenders, to offer products and services that have traditionally been offered by financial institutions. Federal and state banking agencies continue to deliberate over the regulatory treatment of fintech companies, including whether the agencies are authorized to grant charters or licenses to such companies and whether it would be appropriate to do so in consideration of several regulatory and economic factors. The increased demand for, and availability of, alternative payment systems and currencies not only increases competition for such services, but has created a more complex operating environment that, in certain cases, may require additional or different controls to manage fraud, operational, legal and compliance risks.\nNew technologies, such as the blockchain and tokenized payment technologies used by CBIT, could require us to spend more to modify or adapt our products to attract and retain clients or to match products and services offered by our competitors, including fintech companies. New technologies also expose us to additional operational, financial, and regulatory risks. Because many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than we do, or, at present, operate in a less-burdensome regulatory environment, these institutions could pose a significant competitive threat to us.\nAs noted above, our commercial customers utilizing CBIT are currently concentrated in the digital currency industry. The digital currency industry includes a diverse set of businesses that use digital currencies for different purposes and provide services to others who use digital currencies, including the technologies underlying digital currencies, such as blockchain, and the services associated with digital currencies and blockchain. This is a new and rapidly evolving industry, and the viability and future growth of the industry and adoption of digital currencies and the underlying technology is subject to a high degree of uncertainty, including based upon the adoption of the technology, regulation of the industry, and price volatility, among other factors. Because the sector is relatively new, additional risks may emerge which are not yet known or quantifiable.\nDigital currencies, including proprietary, non-public tokens such as CBIT, have only recently become selectively accepted as a form of payment by business. Other factors affecting the further development and acceptance of the digital currency industry and our business include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022the adoption and use of digital currencies, including adoption and use as a substitute for fiat currency or for other uses, which may be adversely impacted by continued price volatility;\n\u2022the use of digital currencies, or the perception of such use, to facilitate illegal activity such as fraud, money laundering, tax evasion and ransomware scams by our customers;\n\u2022heightened risks to digital currency businesses, such as digital currency exchanges, of hacking, malware attacks, and other cyber-security risks, which can lead to significant losses;\n\u2022developments in digital currency trading markets, including decreasing price volatility of digital currencies, resulting in narrowing spreads for digital currency trading and diminishing arbitrage opportunities across digital currency exchanges, or\nincreased price volatility, which could negatively impact our customers and therefore our deposits, either of which in turn may reduce the benefits of CBIT and negatively impact our business; and\n\u2022the maintenance and development of the software protocol of the digital currency networks.\nIf any of these factors, or other factors, slows development of the digital currency industry, it could adversely affect our instant B2B payments initiative and the businesses of the customers upon which it relies, and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf conditions in digital currency markets change such that certain trading strategies currently employed by our institutional investor customers become less profitable, the benefits of CBIT and our instant B2B payments initiative may be diminished, resulting in a decrease in our deposit balances and adversely impacting our growth strategy. In addition, if a competitor or another third party were to launch an alternative to CBIT (such as Federal Reserve's recently announced plan to develop a virtual real time payment system for banks which is expected to be available as early as 2023), we could lose non-interest bearing deposits and our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth strategy could be adversely impacted. Further, we may be unable to attract and retain experienced employees, which could adversely affect our growth. The further development and acceptance of digital currencies and blockchain technology are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate, as discussed above. The slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of digital currency networks and blockchain technology may adversely affect our ability to continue to grow and capitalize on our digital currency strategy.\nOur future growth may be adversely impacted if we are unable to retain and grow this strong, low-to-no cost deposit base. There may be competitive pressures to pay higher interest rates on deposits to our digital currency customers, which could increase funding costs and compress net interest margins. Further, even if we are otherwise able to grow and maintain our non-interest bearing deposit base, our deposit balances may still decrease if our digital currency customers are offered more attractive returns from our competitors. If our digital currency customers withdraw deposits, we could lose a low-cost source of funds which would likely increase our funding costs and reduce our net interest income and net interest margin. These factors could have material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur computer systems and network infrastructure, including CBIT and the instant payments platform on which it operates, could be vulnerable to hardware and cybersecurity issues. Our operations are dependent upon our and our vendors' ability to protect computer equipment upon which these technologies operate against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event. We could also experience a breach by intentional or negligent conduct on the part of our team members or other internal sources. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We could also become the target of various cyberattacks as a result of our focus on the digital currency industry.\nThe technology underlying CBIT and the instant payments platform on which it operates may not function properly, which may have a material impact on Customers' operations and financial condition. The importance of CBIT to Customers' operations means that any technological problems in its functionality may have a material adverse effect on Customers' operations, business model and growth strategy.\nMany of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. Third parties upon which we rely for the technology underlying CBIT may not be able to develop, on a cost-effective basis, systems that will enable us to keep pace with such developments. As a result, our larger competitors may be able to offer additional or superior products compared to those that we will be able to provide, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage. We may lose customers seeking new technology-driven products and services to the extent we are unable to provide such products and services. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important and the failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers, and systems failures, interruptions or breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers. We outsource many of our major systems, such as data processing, loan servicing and deposit processing systems. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe continue to evaluate and implement upgrades and changes to our information technology systems, some of which are significant. Upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and system disruptions, and believe we are taking appropriate action to mitigate the risks through testing, training, and staging implementation, as well as ensuring appropriate commercial contracts are in place with third-party vendors supplying or supporting our information technology initiatives. However, there can be no assurances that we will successfully launch these systems as planned or that they will be implemented without disruptions to our operations. Information technology system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, or failure to successfully implement new or upgraded systems, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Also, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace these systems and could suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our operations.\nIn addition, we provide our customers with the ability to bank remotely, including online, over the Internet, through apps and over the telephone. The secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet and other remote channels is a critical element of remote banking. Our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security breaches. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. To the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and could materially and adversely affect us.\nAdditionally, financial products and services have become increasingly technology-driven. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively and in a cost-efficient manner is dependent on the ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available. Certain competitors may have greater resources to invest in technology and may be better equipped to market new technology-driven products and services. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse impact on our business and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLoss of, or failure to adequately safeguard, confidential or proprietary information may adversely affect our operations, net income or reputation.\nWe regularly collect, process, transmit and store significant amounts of confidential information regarding our customers, team members and others. This information is necessary for the conduct of our business activities, including the ongoing maintenance of deposit, loan, investment management and other account relationships for our customers, and receiving instructions and affecting transactions for those customers and other users of our products and services. In addition to confidential information regarding our customers, team members and others, we compile, process, transmit and store proprietary, non-public information concerning our own business, operations, plans and strategies. In some cases, this confidential or proprietary information is collected, compiled, processed, transmitted or stored by third parties on our behalf.\nInformation security risks have increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks. A failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems or those of our third-party service providers, as a result of cyber-attacks or information security breaches or due to team member error, malfeasance or other disruptions could adversely affect our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and/or cause losses. As a result, cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us.\nIf this confidential or proprietary information were to be mishandled, misused or lost, we could be exposed to significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage, civil litigation and financial loss. Mishandling, misuse or loss of this confidential or proprietary information could occur, for example, if the confidential or proprietary information were erroneously provided to parties who were not permitted to have the information, either by fault of the systems or our team members, or the systems or employees of third parties which have collected, compiled, processed, transmitted or stored the information on our behalf, where the information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties or where there is a failure or breach of the network, communications or information systems which are used to collect, compile, process, transmit or store the information.\nAlthough we employ a variety of physical, procedural and technological safeguards to protect this confidential and proprietary information from mishandling, misuse or loss, these safeguards do not provide absolute assurance that mishandling, misuse or loss of the information will not occur, or that if mishandling, misuse or loss of the information did occur, those events would be promptly detected and addressed. Additionally, as information security risks and cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nBreaches of security measures, computer viruses or malware, fraudulent activity and infrastructure failures could materially and adversely affect our reputation or harm our business including the unauthorized access to or disclosure of data relating to BMT serviced deposit account holders.\nCompanies that process and transmit cardholder information have been specifically and increasingly targeted by sophisticated criminal organizations in an effort to obtain the information and utilize it for fraudulent transactions. The encryption software and the other technologies we use to provide security for storage, processing and transmission of confidential customer and other information may not be effective to protect against data-security breaches. The risk of unauthorized circumvention of our security measures has been heightened by advances in computer capabilities and the increasing sophistication of hackers.\nUnauthorized access to our computer systems or those of our third-party service providers, could result in the theft or publication of the information or the deletion or modification of sensitive records, and could cause interruptions in our operations. Any inability to prevent security breaches could damage our relationships with our higher education institution customers, cause a decrease in transactions by individual cardholders, expose us to liability for unauthorized purchases and subject us to network fines. These claims also could result in protracted and costly litigation. If unsuccessful in defending that litigation, we might be forced to pay damages and/or change our business practices. Further, a significant data-security breach could lead to additional regulation, which could impose new and costly compliance obligations. Any material increase in our costs resulting from litigation or additional regulatory burdens being imposed upon us or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenues and profitability.\nIn addition, our student account holders disclose certain \u201cpersonally identifiable\u201d information, including student contact information, identification numbers and the amount of credit balances, which they expect we will maintain in confidence. It is possible that hackers, customers or team members acting unlawfully or contrary to our policies or other individuals, could improperly access our or our vendors\u2019 systems and obtain or disclose data about our customers. Further, because customer data may also be collected, stored or processed by third-party vendors, it is possible that these vendors could intentionally, negligently or otherwise disclose data about our clients or customers.\nWe rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems, databases and infrastructure, and take reasonable steps to protect them. However, due to their size, complexity, content and integration with or reliance on third-party systems, they are vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, natural disaster and random attack, all of which pose a risk of exposure of sensitive data to unauthorized persons or to the public.\nOur information systems have been, and will continue to be, subject to cybersecurity breaches, which lead to fraudulent activity that can result in identity theft, losses on the part of our banking customers, additional security costs, negative publicity and damage to our reputation and brand. In addition, our customers or team members are the targets of scams that result in the release of sufficient information concerning themselves or their accounts to allow others unauthorized access to their accounts or our systems (e.g., \u201cphishing\u201d and \u201csmishing\u201d). Claims for compensatory or other damages may be brought against us as a result of a breach of our systems or fraudulent activity. If we are unsuccessful in defending against any resulting claims against us, we may be forced to pay damages, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Because many of our employees continue to work remotely on a \u201chybrid model\u201d, the risk of cybersecurity breaches is increased.\nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\nFurther, computer viruses, ransomware or malware could infiltrate our systems, thus disrupting our delivery of services and making our applications unavailable. Although we utilize several preventative and detective security controls in our network, they may be ineffective in preventing computer viruses, ransomware or malware that could damage our relationships with our merchant customers, cause a decrease in transactions by individual cardholders, or cause us to be in non-compliance with applicable network rules and regulations.\nIn addition, a significant incident of fraud or an increase in fraud levels generally involving our products could result in reputational damage to us, which could reduce the use of our products and services. Such incidents could also lead to a large financial loss as a result of the protection for unauthorized purchases we provide to BM Technologies customers given that we may be liable for any uncollectible account holder overdrafts and any other losses due to fraud or theft. Such incidents of fraud could also lead to regulatory intervention, which could increase our compliance costs. Compliance with the various complex laws and regulations is costly and time consuming, and failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, increased regulatory requirements on our services may increase our costs, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Accordingly, account data breaches and related fraudulent activity could have a material adverse effect on our future growth prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA disruption to our systems or infrastructure could damage our reputation, expose us to legal liability, cause us to lose customers and revenue, result in the unintentional disclosure of confidential information or require us to expend significant efforts and resources or incur significant expense to eliminate these problems and address related data and security concerns. The harm to our business could be even greater if such an event occurs during a period of disproportionately heavy demand for our products or services or traffic on our systems or networks.\nPrior to our acquisition of the Disbursement Business, the Federal Reserve Board and FDIC took regulatory enforcement action against Higher One, which subjected us to regulatory inquiry and potential regulatory enforcement action, which may result in liabilities adversely affecting our business, financial conditions and/or results of operations or in reputational harm even after BMT's divestiture.\nSince August 2013 until the acquisition of the Disbursement Business, we provided deposit accounts and services to college students through Higher One, which had relationships with colleges and universities in the United States, using Higher One\u2019s technological services. Because Higher One was not a bank, it had to partner with one or more banks to provide the deposit accounts and services to students. Higher One and one of Higher One\u2019s former bank partners (the \u201cpredecessor bank\u201d), announced in May 2014 that the Federal Reserve Board notified them that certain disclosures and operating processes of these entities may have violated certain laws and regulations and may result in penalties and restitution. In May 2014, the Federal Reserve also informed us, as one of Higher One\u2019s bank partners, that it was recommending a regulatory enforcement action be initiated against us based on the same allegations.\nIn July 2014, the predecessor bank referenced above, which no longer is a partner with Higher One, entered into a consent order to cease and desist with the Federal Reserve Board pursuant to which it agreed to pay a total of $3.5 million in civil money penalties and an additional amount that it may be required to pay in restitution to students in the event Higher One is unable to pay the restitution obligations, if any, imposed on Higher One (\u201cback-up restitution\u201d). We believe that the circumstances of its relationship with Higher One and the student customers are different than the relationship between us and Higher One and the student customers.\nIn December 2015, Higher One entered into consent orders with both the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC. Under the consent order with the Federal Reserve Board, Higher One agreed to pay $2.2 million in civil money penalties and $24 million in restitution to students. Under the consent order with the FDIC, Higher One agreed to pay an additional $2.2 million in civil money penalties and $31 million in restitution to students. In addition, a third partner bank, which is regulated by the FDIC, also entered into a consent order to cease and desist with the FDIC pursuant to which it agreed to pay $1.8 million in civil money penalties and an additional amount in restitution to students in the event Higher One is unable to meet its restitution obligation.\nWe believe that we identified key critical alleged compliance deficiencies within 30 days of first accepting deposits through our relationship with Higher One and caused such deficiencies to be remediated within approximately 120 days. In addition, we understand that the total amount of fees that Higher One collected from students who opened accounts with us during the relevant time period is substantially less than the total fees that Higher One collected from students who opened deposit accounts at the other partner banks during the relevant time period. In addition, as Higher One paid the restitution and deposited such monies to pay the required restitution, we did not expect that backup restitution would be required.\nNonetheless, as previously disclosed, we had been in discussions with the Federal Reserve Board regarding these matters from 2013 and in an effort to move forward, on December 6, 2016, we agreed to the issuance by the Federal Reserve Board of a combined Order to Cease and Desist and Order of Assessment of a Civil Money Penalty Issued Upon Consent Pursuant to the Order and agreed to a penalty of $960 thousand. We had previously set aside a reserve for the civil money penalty and made payment in 2016.\nWe remain subject to the jurisdiction and examination of the Federal Reserve Board, and further action could be taken to the extent we do not comply with the terms of the Order or if the Federal Reserve Board were to identify additional violations of applicable laws and regulations. Any further action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and/or results of operations or our reputation.\nWe intend to engage in acquisitions of other businesses from time to time. These acquisitions may not produce revenue or earnings enhancements or cost savings at levels, or within time frames, originally anticipated and may result in unforeseen integration difficulties.\nAlthough we currently do not have any agreements or understandings with respect to business acquisitions, we regularly evaluate opportunities to strengthen our current market position by acquiring and investing in banks and in other complementary businesses, or opening new branches, and when appropriate opportunities arise, subject to regulatory approval, we plan to engage in acquisitions of other businesses and in opening new branches. Such transactions could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition, including short and long-term liquidity. Our acquisition activities could be material to our business. For example, we could issue additional shares of Voting Common Stock in a purchase transaction, which could dilute current shareholders\u2019 value or ownership interest. These activities could require us to use a substantial amount of cash or other liquid assets and/\nor incur debt. In addition, if goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions were determined to be impaired, then we would be required to recognize a charge against our earnings, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations during the period in which the impairment was recognized. Our acquisition activities could involve a number of additional risks, including the risks of:\n\u2022incurring time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and negotiating the terms of potential transactions, resulting in our attention being diverted from the operation of our existing business;\n\u2022using inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution or assets;\n\u2022being potentially exposed to unknown or contingent liabilities of banks and businesses we acquire;\n\u2022being required to expend time and expense to integrate the operations and personnel of the combined businesses;\n\u2022experiencing higher operating expenses relative to operating income from the new operations;\n\u2022creating an adverse effect on our results of operations;\n\u2022losing key team members and customers as a result of an acquisition that is poorly received; and\n\u2022incurring significant problems relating to the conversion of the financial and customer data of the entity being acquired into our financial and customer product systems.\nAdditionally, in evaluating potential acquisition opportunities, we may seek to acquire failed banks through FDIC-assisted acquisitions. While the FDIC may, in such acquisitions, provide assistance to mitigate certain risks, such as sharing in exposure to loan losses and providing indemnification against certain liabilities, of the failed institution, we may not be able to accurately estimate our potential exposure to loan losses and other potential liabilities, or the difficulty of integration, in acquiring such institutions.\nDepending on the condition of any institutions or assets that are acquired, any acquisition may, at least in the near term, materially adversely affect our capital and earnings and, if not successfully integrated following the acquisition, may continue to have such effects. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with pending or potential acquisitions. Our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on levels of reported net income, return on equity and return on assets and the ability to achieve our business strategy and maintain market value.\nOur acquisitions generally will require regulatory approvals, and failure to obtain them would restrict our growth.\nAlthough we currently do not have any agreements or understandings with respect to business acquisitions, we may in the future seek to complement and expand our business by pursuing strategic acquisitions of community banking franchises and other businesses. Generally, any acquisition of target financial institutions, banking centers or other banking assets by us may require approval by, and cooperation from, a number of governmental regulatory agencies, possibly including the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC, as well as state banking regulators. In acting on applications, federal banking regulators consider, among other factors:\n\u2022the effect of the acquisition on competition;\n\u2022the financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, capital levels and future prospects of the applicant and the bank(s) involved;\n\u2022the quantity and complexity of previously consummated acquisitions;\n\u2022the managerial resources of the applicant and the bank(s) involved;\n\u2022the convenience and needs of the community, including the record of performance under CRA;\n\u2022the effectiveness of the applicant in combating money laundering activities; and\n\u2022the extent to which the acquisition would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the United States banking or financial system.\nSuch regulators could deny our application based on the above criteria or other considerations, which could restrict our growth, or the regulatory approvals may not be granted on terms that are acceptable to us. For example, we could be required to sell banking centers as a condition to receiving regulatory approvals, and such a condition may not be acceptable to us or may reduce the benefit of any acquisition.\nTo the extent that we are unable to increase loans through organic core loan growth, we may be unable to successfully implement our growth strategy, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nIn addition to growing our business through strategic acquisitions, we also intend to grow our business through organic core loan growth. While loan growth has been strong, and our loan balances have increased over the last several fiscal years, if we are unsuccessful in diversifying our loan originations, or if we do not grow the business lines, our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage our growth.\nOur future operating results and financial condition depend to a large extent on our ability to successfully manage our growth. Our growth has placed, and it may continue to place, significant demands on our operations and management. Whether through additional acquisitions or organic growth, our current plan to expand our business is dependent upon our ability to:\n\u2022continue to implement and improve our operational, credit underwriting and administration, financial, accounting, enterprise risk management and other internal and disclosure controls and procedures and our reporting systems and processes in order to manage a growing number of client relationships;\n\u2022comply with changes in, and an increasing number of, laws, rules and regulations, including those of any national securities exchange on which any of our securities become listed;\n\u2022scale our technology and other systems\u2019 platforms;\n\u2022maintain and attract appropriate staffing;\n\u2022operate profitably or raise capital; and\n\u2022support our asset growth with adequate deposits, funding and liquidity while expanding our net interest margin and meeting our customers\u2019 and regulators\u2019 liquidity requirements.\nWe may not successfully implement improvements to, or integrate, our management information and control systems, credit underwriting and administration, internal and disclosure controls, and procedures and processes in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. In particular, our controls and procedures must be able to accommodate an increase in loan volume in various markets and the infrastructure that comes with new banking centers and banks. Our growth strategy may divert management from our existing business and may require us to incur additional expenditures to expand our administrative and operational infrastructure and, if we are unable to effectively manage and grow our banking franchise, including to the satisfaction of our regulators, we could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to manage our current and future expansion in our operations, we may experience compliance, operational and regulatory problems and delays, have to slow our pace of growth or even stop our market and product expansion, or have to incur additional expenditures beyond current projections to support such growth, any one of which could materially and adversely affect us. If we experience difficulties with the development of new business activities or the integration process of acquired businesses, the anticipated benefits of any particular acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Additionally, we may be unable to recognize synergies, operating efficiencies, cost projections and/or expected benefits within expected time frames, or at all. We also may not be able to preserve the goodwill of an acquired financial institution. Our growth could lead to increases in our legal, audit, administrative and financial compliance costs, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nIf our techniques for managing risk are ineffective, we may be exposed to material unanticipated losses.\nIn order to manage the significant risks inherent in our business, we must maintain effective policies, procedures and systems that enable us to identify, monitor and control our exposure to material risks, such as credit, interest rate, operational, compliance and reputational risks. Our risk management methods may prove to be ineffective due to their design, implementation or the degree to which we adhere to them, or as a result of the lack of adequate, accurate or timely information or otherwise. If our risk management efforts are ineffective, we could suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we could be subject to litigation, particularly from our customers, and sanctions or fines from regulators. Our techniques for managing the risks we face may not fully mitigate the risk exposure in all economic or market environments, including exposure to risks that we might fail to identify or anticipate.\nWe are dependent upon maintaining an effective system of internal controls to provide reasonable assurance that transactions and activities are conducted in accordance with established policies and procedures and are captured and reported in the financial statements. Failure to comply with the system of internal controls may result in events or losses which could adversely affect our operations, net income, financial condition, reputation and compliance with laws and regulations.\nOur system of internal controls, including internal controls over financial reporting, is an important element of our risk management framework. Management regularly reviews and seeks to improve our internal controls, including annual review of key policies and procedures and annual review and testing of key internal controls over financial reporting. Any system of internal controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and expectations of employee conduct and can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the internal control structure are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures, or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, net income, financial condition, reputation, compliance with laws and regulations, or may result in untimely or inaccurate financial reporting.\nAs management continues to evaluate and work to enhance internal control over financial reporting, it may determine that additional measures are required to address control deficiencies or strengthen internal control over financial reporting. If Customers' remediation efforts do not operate effectively or if it is unsuccessful in implementing or following its remediation efforts, this may result in untimely or inaccurate reporting of Customers' financial results.\nWe may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our loan funding obligations, deposit withdrawals, or other business needs and fund our asset growth unless we maintain sufficient liquidity.\nWe must maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our balance sheet growth in order to successfully grow our revenues, make loans, and repay deposit and other liabilities as these mature or are drawn. This liquidity can be gathered in both wholesale and non-wholesale funding markets. Our asset growth over the past few years has been funded with various forms of deposits and wholesale funding, including brokered and wholesale time deposits, FHLB advances and Federal funds line borrowings. Total wholesale deposits including brokered and municipal deposits were 14.2% of total deposits at December 31, 2021. Our gross loan to deposit ratio was 86.8% at December 31, 2021, and our loan to deposit ratio excluding the commercial mortgage warehouse and PPP loan portfolio was 53.4% at December 31, 2021. Wholesale funding can cost more than deposits generated from our traditional branch system and customer relationships and is subject to certain practical limits such as our liquidity policy limits, our available collateral for FHLB borrowings capacity and Federal funds line limits with our lenders. Additionally, regulators consider wholesale funding beyond certain points to be imprudent and might suggest or require that future asset growth be reduced or halted. In the absence of appropriate levels and mix of funding, we might need to reduce interest-earning asset growth through the reduction of current production, sales of loans and/or the sale of participation interests in future and current loans. This might reduce our future growth and net income.\nThe amount of funds loaned to us is generally dependent on the value of the eligible collateral pledged and our financial condition. These lenders could reduce the percentages loaned against various collateral categories, eliminate certain types of collateral and otherwise modify or even terminate their loan programs, if further disruptions in the capital markets occur. Any change to or termination of our borrowings from the FHLB or correspondent banks could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition, including liquidity.\nWe may not be able to develop and retain a strong core deposit base and other low-cost, stable funding sources.\nWe depend on checking, savings and money market deposit account balances and other forms of customer deposits as a primary source of funding for our lending activities. We expect that our future loan growth will largely depend on our ability to retain and grow a strong, low-cost deposit base. As of December 31, 2021, $380.5 million, or 75.0%, of our total time deposits, are scheduled to mature through December 31, 2022. We are working to transition certain of our customers to lower-cost traditional bank deposits as higher-cost funding, such as time deposits, mature. If interest rates increase, whether due to changes in inflation, monetary policy, competition or other factors, we would expect to pay higher interest rates on deposits, which would increase our funding costs and compress our net interest margin. We may not succeed in moving our deposits to lower-yielding savings and transactions products, which could materially and adversely affect us. In addition, customers, particularly those who may maintain deposits in excess of insured limits, continue to be concerned about the extent to which their deposits are insured by the FDIC. Our customers may withdraw deposits to ensure that their deposits with us are fully insured and may place excess amounts in other institutions or make investments that are perceived as being more secure and/or higher yielding. Further, even if we are able to maintain and grow our deposit base, deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, will provide a better risk/return tradeoff. If customers move money out of bank deposits, we could lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and net income.\nCertain deposit balances serviced by BM Technologies can vary over the course of the year based on student enrollment and the timing of deposits made into those accounts, with seasonal inflows at the start of each semester that are drawn down until the following\nsemester. Additionally, any such loss of funds could result in lower loan originations and growth, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including liquidity. Our deposit service agreement with BM Technologies is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2022 and will not be renewed. As of December 31, 2021, Customers held $1.8 billion of deposits serviced by BM Technologies, which are expected to leave Customers Bank by December 31, 2022 and may impact the funding of Customers' future growth initiatives.\nCompetitors\u2019 technology-driven products and services and improvements to such products and services may adversely affect our ability to generate core deposits through mobile banking.\nOur organic growth strategy focuses on, among other things, expanding market share through our \u201chigh-tech\u201d model, which includes remote account opening, remote deposit capture, mobile and digital banking. These technological advances are intended to allow us to generate additional core deposits at a lower cost than generating deposits through opening and operating branch locations. Some of our competitors may have greater resources to invest in technology and may be better equipped to market new technology-driven products and services. This may result in limiting, reducing or otherwise adversely affecting our growth strategy in this area and our access to deposits through mobile banking. In addition, to the extent we fail to keep pace with technological changes or incur respectively large expenses to implement technological changes, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe may incur losses due to minority investments in other financial institutions or related companies.\nWe may make or consider making minority investments in other financial institutions or technology companies in the financial services business, or other unrelated businesses, including for strategic reasons or to see technological improvements or advantages. If we do so, we may not be able to influence the activities of companies in which we invest and may suffer losses due to these activities. Investments in foreign companies could pose additional risks as a result of distance, language barriers and potential lack of information (for example, foreign institutions, including foreign financial institutions, may not be obligated to provide as much information regarding their operations as those in the United States). Our investment in Religare, a diversified financial services company in India, represents such an investment. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Customers sold all of the outstanding shares in CB Green Ventures Pte Ltd. and CUBI India Ventures Pte Ltd., which held the equity securities issued by Religare, for $3.8 million, and recognized $2.8 million in loss on sale of foreign subsidiaries within non-interest income on the consolidated statement of income.\nRisks related to the divestiture of BMT\nWe continue to face the risks and challenges associated with BM Technologies following the merger of BMT with Megalith Financial Acquisition Corp.\nOn January 4, 2021, we completed the divestiture of BMT through the merger of BMT with MFAC. In connection with the closing of the divestiture, MFAC changed its name to \u201cBM Technologies, Inc.\u201d Our agreement with MFAC relating to the merger of BMT and MFAC provided that the shares issuable by MFAC in connection with the merger would be issued directly to Customers Bancorp shareholders rather than being issued to and held by us. In connection with the divestiture, we have entered into various agreements with BM Technologies, including a transition services agreement, software license agreement, deposit servicing agreement, non-competition agreement and loan agreement for periods ranging from one to ten years. The deposit service agreement is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2022 and will not be renewed. As of December 31, 2021, Customers held $1.8 billion of deposits serviced by BM Technologies, which are expected to leave Customers Bank by December 31, 2022 and may impact the funding of Customers' future growth initiatives. The loan agreement with BM Technologies was terminated early in November 2021. The transition services agreement with BM Technologies, as amended, expires on March 31, 2022, except for accounting services which expired on February 15, 2022. We will continue to face the risks and challenges associated with BM Technologies through these agreements. We are also exposed to potential liabilities to the acquirer under the contractual provisions such as representation, warranties and indemnities. If we are unable to address and manage these risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks related to the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic, Climate Change and Macroeconomic Conditions\nWorsening general business and economic conditions could materially and adversely affect us.\nOur business and operations are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States. If the U.S. economy experiences worsening conditions such as a recession, we could be materially and adversely affected. Weak economic conditions may be characterized by deflation, instability in debt and equity capital markets, a lack of liquidity and/or depressed prices in the secondary market for mortgage loans, increased delinquencies on loans, residential and commercial real estate price declines and lower home sales and commercial activity. Adverse changes in any of these factors could be detrimental to our business. Our business is also significantly\naffected by monetary and related policies of the U.S. Federal Government, its agencies and government-sponsored entities. Adverse changes in economic factors or U.S. Government policies could have a negative effect on us.\nOver the last several years, there have been several instances where there has been uncertainty regarding the ability of Congress and the President collectively to reach agreement on federal budgetary and spending matters. A period of failure to reach agreement on these matters, particularly if accompanied by an actual or threatened government shutdown, may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy. Additionally, a prolonged government shutdown may inhibit our ability to evaluate borrower creditworthiness and originate and sell certain government-backed loans.\nIn addition, the U.S. economy contracted into a recession in the first half of 2020, primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S. government and the Federal Reserve responded to the pandemic with unprecedented measures. In addition to the Federal Reserve reducing the target federal funds rate, Congress passed the CARES Act that included an estimated $2 trillion stimulus package. Although the U.S. economy began to recover in third quarter 2020 as social distancing policies loosened, economic metrics in fourth quarter 2020 indicated an uneven path to recovery. In December 2020, Congress amended the CARES Act with the CAA to provide an additional $900 billion of stimulus relief to mitigate the continued impacts of the pandemic. While certain factors point to improving economic conditions, uncertainty remains regarding the path of the economic recovery, the mitigating impacts of government interventions, the success of vaccine distribution and the efficacy of administered vaccines to the COVID-19 variants. Conditions related to inflation, global supply chains, unemployment, volatile interest rates, international conflicts, changes in trade policies and other factors, such as real estate values, state and local municipal budget deficits, government spending and the U.S. national debt may, directly and indirectly, adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our business, and the ultimate impact on our business and financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, lowered equity market valuations, created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets, and increased unemployment levels. In addition, the pandemic has resulted in temporary closures of many businesses and the institution of social distancing and sheltering in place requirements in many states and communities. As a result, the demand for our products and services may be significantly impacted. Furthermore, the pandemic has influenced and could further influence the recognition of credit losses in our loan and lease portfolios and has increased and could further increase our ACL, particularly as businesses remain closed and as more customers may draw on their lines of credit or seek additional loans to help finance their businesses. Similarly, because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers, the securities we hold may lose value. Our business operations may also be disrupted if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including:\n\u2022The duration, extent, and severity of the pandemic. COVID-19 has not yet been contained; continuing spread and rise of new variants could affect significantly more households and businesses, or cause additional limitations on commercial activity, increased unemployment, increased property vacancy rates and general economic and financial instability. The continuation of the pandemic may also negatively impact regional economic conditions for a period of time, resulting in declines in loan demand and collateral values. The duration and severity of the pandemic continues to be impossible to predict, as is the potential for a seasonal or other resurgence. We also believe we will continue to see the economic effects of the pandemic even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, which is expected to continue to affect our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.\n\u2022The response of governmental authorities. To date, many of the actions of governmental authorities, including eviction forbearance, occupancy restrictions and vaccine mandates, have been directed toward curtailing household and business activity to contain COVID-19 while simultaneously deploying fiscal and monetary policy measures to partially mitigate the adverse effects on individual households and businesses. The ultimate success or impact of these actions and their effect on our customers and the economy generally is still unclear. Further, some measures, such as a suspension of mortgage and other loan payments and foreclosures, may have a negative impact on our business.\n\u2022The effect on our customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers. COVID-19 and its associated consequences and uncertainties are affecting individuals, households, and businesses differently and unevenly. Negative impacts on our customers could result in increased risk of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures and losses on our loans.\n\u2022The effect on economies and markets. Whether the actions of governmental and nongovernmental authorities will be successful in mitigating the adverse effects of COVID-19 is unclear. National, regional, and local economies and markets could suffer disruptions that are lasting. Governmental actions are meaningfully influencing the interest-rate environment\nand financial-market activity and could have lasting effects on taxes and other economic factors, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic and its variants continue to adversely affect the economy, and/or adversely affects our business, results of operations or financial condition, it may also have the effect of increasing the likelihood and/or magnitude of other risks described herein, including those risks related to business operations, industry/market, our securities and credit, or risks described in our other filings with the SEC.\nWe are a participating lender in SBA\u2019s PPP program and have originated a significant number of loans under this program, which may result in a material amount of PPP loans remaining on our consolidated balance sheets at a very low yield for an extended period of time.\nThe PPP, originally established under the CARES Act and extended under the Economic Aid Act and CAA, authorizes financial institutions to make federally-guaranteed loans to qualifying small businesses and non-profit organizations. These loans carry an interest rate of 1% per annum and a maturity of 2 years for loans originated prior to June 5, 2020 and 5 years for loans originated on or after June 5, 2020. The PPP provides that such loans may be forgiven if the borrowers meet certain requirements with respect to maintaining employee headcount and payroll and the use of the loan proceeds after the loan is originated. The initial phase of the PPP, after being extended multiple times by Congress, expired on August 8, 2020. However, on January 11, 2021, the SBA reopened the PPP for First Draw PPP loans to small business and non-profit organizations that did not receive a loan through the initial PPP phase. Further, on January 13, 2021, the SBA reopened the PPP for Second Draw loans to small businesses and non-profit organizations that did receive a loan through the initial PPP phase. At least $25 billion had been set aside for Second Draw PPP loans to eligible borrowers with a maximum of 10 employees or for loans of $250,000 or less to eligible borrowers in low or moderate income neighborhoods. Generally, businesses with more than 300 employees and/or less than a 25 percent reduction in gross receipts between comparable quarters in 2019 and 2020 were not eligible for Second Draw loans. Further, maximum loan amounts were increased for accommodation and food service businesses. On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was enacted expanding eligibility for first and second round of PPP loans and revising the exclusions from payroll costs for purposes of loan forgiveness. The PPP ended on May 31, 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had PPP loans with outstanding balances of $3.3 billion. Our PPP participation was very significant especially compared to the participation of similarly sized and larger competitor financial institutions. Considering our immediate response to originate PPP loans, the loans originated under this program may present potential fraud risk, increasing the risk that loan forgiveness may not be obtained by the borrowers and that the guaranty may not be honored. In addition, there is risk that the borrowers may not qualify for the loan forgiveness feature due to the conduct of the borrower after the loan is originated. Further, although the SBA has streamlined the loan forgiveness process for loans $50,000 or less, it has taken longer than initially anticipated for the SBA to finalize the forgiveness processes. On January 19, 2021, the SBA increased the streamlined loan forgiveness process to loans $150,000 or less. In the third quarter of 2021, Customers partnered with the SBA to deliver responsive digital loan forgiveness service to the small business borrowers through the SBA's portal. Nonetheless, these factors may result in us having to hold a significant amount of these low-yield loans on our books for a significant period of time. We will continue to face increased operational demands and pressures as we monitor and service our PPP loan portfolio, process applications for loan forgiveness and pursue recourse under the SBA guarantees. We have been exposed, and may in the future be subject, to litigation and claims by borrowers under the PPP loans that we have made, and could be subject to investigation and scrutiny by our regulators, Congress, the SBA, the U.S. Treasury Department and other government agencies.\nClimate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may result in operational changes and expenditures that could significantly impact our business.\nThe current and anticipated effects of climate change are creating an increasing level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result, political and social attention to the issue of climate change has increased. In recent years, governments across the world have entered into international agreements to attempt to reduce global temperatures, in part by limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies have continued to propose and advance numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives seeking to mitigate the effects of climate change. Such initiatives are expected to continue under the new administration, including potentially increasing supervisory expectations with respect to banks' risk management practices, accounting for the effects of climate change in stress testing scenarios and systematic risk assessments, revising expectations for credit portfolio concentrations based on climate related factors, and encouraging investment by banks in climate-related initiatives and lending to communities disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change. These agreements and measures may result in the imposition of taxes and fees, the required purchase of emission credits, and the implementation of significant operational changes, each of which may require Customers to expend significant capital and incur compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. Given the lack of empirical data on the credit and other financial risks posed by climate change, it is impossible to predict how climate change may impact our financial condition and operations; however, as a banking organization, the physical effects of climate change may present certain unique risks to Customers. For example, weather disasters, shifts in local climates and other disruptions related to climate change\nmay adversely affect the value of real properties securing our loans, which could diminish the value of our loan portfolio. Such events may also cause reductions in regional and local economic activity that may have an adverse effect on our customers, which could limit our ability to raise and invest capital in these areas and communities, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, public health issues, acts of war or terrorism, and other external events could significantly impact our ability to conduct business.\nSuch events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, adversely impact our team member base, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue, and cause us to incur additional expenses. For example, one of our locations experienced flooding and incurred property damage in 2021 as a result. Although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Regulation of Our Industry\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be adversely affected by the highly regulated environment in which we operate, including the effects of heightened regulatory requirements applicable to banks with assets in excess of $10 billion.\nAs a bank holding company, we are subject to federal supervision and regulation. Federal regulation of the banking industry, along with tax and accounting laws, regulations, rules and standards, may limit our operations significantly and control the methods by which we conduct business, just as they limit those of other banking organizations. In addition, compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations can impose additional compliance costs. The Dodd-Frank Act, which imposes significant regulatory and compliance changes on financial institutions, is an example of this type of federal regulation. Many of these regulations are intended to protect depositors, customers, the public, the banking system as a whole, or the FDIC insurance funds, not stockholders. Regulatory requirements and discretion affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and many other aspects of our business. There are laws and regulations which restrict transactions between us and our subsidiaries. These requirements may constrain our operations, and the adoption of new laws and changes to or repeal of existing laws may have a further impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. Also, the burden imposed by those federal and state regulations may place banks in general, including Customers Bank in particular, at a competitive disadvantage compared to their non-banking competitors. We are also subject to requirements with respect to the confidentiality of information obtained from clients concerning their identities, business and personal financial information, employment and other matters. We require our team members to agree to keep all such information confidential, and we monitor compliance. Failure to comply with confidentiality requirements could result in material liability and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nBank holding companies and financial institutions are extensively regulated and currently face an uncertain regulatory environment. Applicable laws, regulations, interpretations, enforcement policies and accounting principles have been subject to significant changes in recent years and may be subject to significant future changes. Future changes may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal and state regulatory agencies may adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied or interpreted. We cannot predict the substance or effect of pending or future legislation or regulation or the application of laws and regulations on us. Compliance with current and potential regulation, as well as regulatory scrutiny, may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner by requiring us to expend significant time, effort and resources to ensure compliance and respond to any regulatory inquiries or investigations. In addition, press coverage and other public statements that assert some form of wrongdoing by financial services companies (including press coverage and public statements that do not involve us) may result in regulatory inquiries or investigations, which, independent of the outcome, may be time-consuming and expensive and may divert time, effort and resources from our business. Evolving regulations and guidance concerning executive compensation may also impose limitations on us that affect our ability to compete successfully for executive and management talent.\nIn addition, given the current economic and financial environment, regulators may elect to alter standards or the interpretation of the standards used to measure regulatory compliance or to determine the adequacy of liquidity, certain risk management or other operational practices for financial services companies in a manner that impacts our ability to implement our strategy and could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the regulatory agencies have extremely broad direction in their interpretation of the regulations and laws and\ntheir interpretation of the quality of our loan portfolio, securities portfolio and other assets. If any regulatory agency\u2019s assessment of the quality of our assets, operations, lending practices, investment practices, capital structure or other assets of our business differs from our assessment, we may be required to take additional charges or undertake or refrain from undertaking actions that would have the effect of materially reducing our earnings, capital ratios and share price.\nBecause our total assets exceeded $10 billion at December 31, 2019, we and our bank subsidiary became subject to increased regulatory requirements in 2020. The Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations impose various additional requirements on bank holding companies with $10 billion or more in total assets. In addition, banks with $10 billion or more in total assets are primarily examined by the CFPB with respect to various federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations. As a relatively new agency with evolving regulations and practices, there is some uncertainty as to how the CFPB\u2019s examination and regulatory authority might impact our business. Further, the possibility of future changes in the authority of the CFPB by Congress or the Biden Administration is uncertain, and we cannot predict the impact, if any, changes to the CFPB may have on our business.\nWith respect to deposit-taking activities, banks with assets in excess of $10 billion are subject to two changes. First, these institutions are subject to a deposit assessment based on a new scorecard issued by the FDIC. This scorecard considers, among other things, the bank\u2019s CAMELS rating, results of asset-related stress testing and funding-related stress, as well as our use of core deposits, among other things. Depending on the results of the bank\u2019s performance under that scorecard, the total base assessment rate is between 1.5 to 40 basis points. Any increase in our bank subsidiary\u2019s deposit insurance assessments may result in an increased expense related to our use of deposits as a funding source. Additionally, banks with over $10 billion in total assets are no longer exempt from the requirements of the Federal Reserve\u2019s rules on interchange transaction fees for debit cards. This means that, as of July 1, 2020, our bank subsidiary is limited to receiving only a \u201creasonable\u201d interchange transaction fee for any debit card transactions processed using debit cards issued by our bank subsidiary to our customers. The Federal Reserve has determined that it is unreasonable for a bank with more than $10 billion in total assets to receive more than $0.21 plus 5 basis points of the transaction plus a $0.01 fraud adjustment for an interchange transaction fee for debit card transactions. This reduction in the amount of interchange fees we receive for electronic debit interchange reduced our revenues in 2020, and will continue to affect our results of operations for the duration of the Deposit Servicing Agreement with BM Technologies.\nOur regulators may also consider our compliance with these regulatory requirements when examining our operations generally or considering any request for regulatory approval we may make, even requests for approvals on unrelated matters.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment, and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and accounting principles, or changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of our operations. Intended to protect customers, depositors and the FDIC\u2019s DIF and not our shareholders, these laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on our business activities, limit the dividends or distributions that we can pay, restrict the ability of our subsidiary bank to engage in transactions with the Bancorp, and impose certain specific accounting requirements on us that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than under generally accepted accounting principles. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs and may make certain products impermissible or uneconomic. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure follows good faith effort or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business activities, reputational harm, fines and other penalties, any of which could materially and adversely affect us. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive and also materially and adversely affect us. Provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act prohibit incentive compensation arrangements that would encourage inappropriate risk taking at covered financial institutions, which includes a bank or bank holding company with $1 billion or more in assets, such as the Company. These prohibitions may adversely affect our ability to retain and attract executives and other high-performing team members or our ability to compete with companies that are not subject to such provisions.\nOur use of third-party vendors and our other ongoing third-party business relationships are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and attention.\nWe regularly use third-party vendors as part of our business and have other ongoing business relationships with other third parties, including BM Technologies after the completion of the divestiture of BMT on January 4, 2021. These types of third-party relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by federal banking regulators. Regulation requires us to perform enhanced due diligence, perform ongoing monitoring and control our-third party vendors and other ongoing third-party business relationships. In certain cases, we may be required to renegotiate our agreements with these vendors to meet these enhanced requirements, which could increase our costs. We expect that our regulators will hold us responsible for deficiencies in our oversight and control of our third-party relationships and in the performance of the parties with which we have these relationships. As a result, if our\nregulators conclude that we have not exercised adequate oversight and control over our-third party vendors or other ongoing third-party business relationships or that such third parties have not performed appropriately, we could be subject to enforcement actions, including civil money penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for customer remediation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations and to regular examinations by our regulators of our business and compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations or to adequately address any matters identified during our examinations could materially and adversely affect us.\nFederal banking agencies regularly conduct comprehensive examinations of our business, including our compliance with applicable laws, regulations and policies. Examination reports and ratings (which often are not publicly available) and other aspects of this supervisory framework can materially impact the conduct, organic and acquisition growth and profitability of our business. Our regulators have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities and may impose a variety of remedial actions, conditions or limitations on our business operations if, as a result of an examination, they determined that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we or our management were in violation of any law, regulation or policy. Examples of those actions, conditions or limitations include enjoining \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, requiring affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any asserted violation of law, issuing administrative orders that can be judicially enforced, directing increases in our capital, assessing civil monetary penalties against our officers or directors, removing officers and directors and, if a conclusion was reached that the offending conditions cannot be corrected, or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, terminating our deposit insurance. Other actions, formal or informal, that may be imposed could restrict our growth, including regulatory denials to expand branches, relocate, add subsidiaries and affiliates, expand into new financial activities or merge with or purchase other financial institutions. The timing of these examinations, including the timing of the resolution of any issues identified by our regulators in the examinations and the final determination by them with respect to the imposition of any remedial actions, conditions or limitations on our business operations, is generally not within our control. We also could suffer reputational harm in the event of any perceived or actual noncompliance with certain laws and regulations. If we become subject to such regulatory actions, we could be materially and adversely affected.\nOther litigation and regulatory actions, including possible enforcement actions, could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments or other requirements resulting in increased expenses or restrictions on our business activities.\nOur business is subject to increased litigation and regulatory risks as a result of a number of factors, including the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry and the focus of state and federal prosecutors on banks and the financial services industry generally. This focus has only intensified since the latest financial crisis and due to COVID-19 pandemic and related federal and state government responses, with regulators and prosecutors focusing on a variety of financial institution practices and requirements, including our origination and servicing of PPP loans and granting of deferments under the CARES Act, as amended by the CAA, and the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications by Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus. We may, from time to time, be the subject of subpoenas, requests for information, reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental agencies regarding our business. Legal or regulatory actions may subject us to substantial compensatory or punitive damages, significant fines, penalties, obligations to change our business practices or other requirements resulting in increased expenses, diminished income and damage to our reputation. Our involvement in any such matters, even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor, could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business. Further, any settlement, consent order or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by government agencies may result in litigation, investigations or proceedings as other litigants and government agencies begin independent reviews of the same activities. As a result, the outcome of legal and regulatory actions could be material to our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, depending on, among other factors, the level of our earnings for that period and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe FDIC\u2019s restoration plan and the related increased assessment rate could materially and adversely affect us.\nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured depository institutions up to applicable limits. The amount of a particular institution\u2019s deposit insurance assessment is based on that institution\u2019s risk classification under an FDIC risk-based assessment system. An institution\u2019s risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to its regulators. We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures, we may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums than the recently increased levels. Any future additional assessments, increases or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums may materially and adversely affect us, including reducing our profitability or limiting our ability to pursue certain business opportunities.\nThe Federal Reserve may require us to commit capital resources to support our subsidiary bank.\nAs a matter of policy, the Federal Reserve, which examines us and our subsidiaries, expects a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the \u201csource of strength\u201d doctrine, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act directs the federal bank regulators to require that all companies that directly or indirectly control an insured depository institution serve as a source of strength for the institution. Under this requirement, we could be required to provide financial assistance to Customers Bank or any other subsidiary banks we may own in the future should they experience financial distress.\nA capital injection may be required at times when we do not have the resources to provide it, and therefore, we may be required to borrow the funds or raise additional equity capital from third parties. Any loans by a holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company\u2019s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the holding company\u2019s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its indebtedness. Any financing that must be done by the holding company in order to make the required capital injection may be difficult and expensive and may not be available on attractive terms, or at all, which likely would have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are subject to stringent capital requirements which may adversely impact return on equity, require additional capital raises, or limit the ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares.\nIn September 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, announced an agreement to a strengthened set of capital requirements for internationally active banking organizations in the United States and around the world, known as Basel III. Basel III narrowed the definition of capital, introduced requirements for minimum Tier 1 common capital, increased requirements for minimum Tier 1 capital and total risk-based capital, and changed risk-weighting methodologies. Basel III was fully phased in by January 1, 2019.\nIn July 2013, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule regarding new capital requirements pursuant to Basel III. These rules, which became effective on January 1, 2015, for community banks, increased the required amount of regulatory capital that we must hold, and failure to comply with the capital rules will lead to limitations on the dividend payments to us by Customers Bank and other elective distributions.\nIn December 2017, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III regulatory framework (commonly referred to as Basel IV). Among other things, these standards revise the Basel Committee\u2019s standardized approach for credit risk and provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. Under the Basel framework, these standards generally became effective on January 1, 2022, with an aggregate output floor phasing in through January 1, 2027. Under the current U.S. capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced-approaches institutions and not to us. The impact of Basel IV on us will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the federal bank regulators.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe federal Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by PATRIOT Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Treasury Department to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the DOJ, Drug Enforcement Administration and IRS. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by OFAC. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we have already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions (such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans), which could materially and adversely affect us. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\nFederal, state and local consumer lending laws may restrict our ability to originate certain mortgage loans or increase our risk of liability with respect to such loans and could increase our cost of doing business.\nFederal, state and local laws have been adopted that are intended to eliminate certain lending practices considered \u201cpredatory.\u201d These laws prohibit practices such as steering borrowers away from more affordable products, selling unnecessary insurance to borrowers, repeatedly refinancing loans and making loans without a reasonable expectation that the borrowers will be able to repay the loans irrespective of the value of the underlying property. It is our policy not to make predatory loans, but these laws create the potential for liability with respect to our lending and loan investment activities. They increase our cost of doing business and, ultimately, may prevent us from making certain loans and cause us to reduce the average percentage rate or the points and fees on loans that we do make.\nLoans that we make through certain federal programs are dependent on the Federal Government\u2019s continuation and support of these programs and on our compliance with their requirements.\nWe participate in various U.S. Government agency guarantee programs, including PPP and other programs operated by the SBA. We are responsible for following all applicable U.S. Government agency regulations, guidelines and policies whenever we originate loans as part of these guarantee programs. If we fail to follow any applicable regulations, guidelines or policies associated with a particular guarantee program, any loans we originate as part of that program may lose the associated guarantee, exposing us to credit risk to which we would not otherwise have been exposed or underwritten as part of our origination process for U.S. Government agency guaranteed loans, or result in our inability to continue originating loans under such programs. The loss of any guarantees for loans we have extended under U.S. Government agency guarantee programs or the loss of our ability to participate in such programs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTaxes\nReviews performed by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities for the fiscal years that remain open for investigation may result in a change to income taxes recorded in our consolidated financial statements and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of various states primarily in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Generally, Customers is no longer subject to examination by federal, state, and local taxing authorities for years prior to the year ended December 31, 2018. Customers is currently under audit by New York for the 2015-2017 tax years and by New York City for the 2016-2017 tax years. The results of these reviews could result in increased recognition of income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements as well as possible fines and penalties.\nChanges in U.S. federal, state or local tax laws may negatively impact our financial performance.\nWe are subject to changes in tax law that could increase Customers' effective tax rates. These law changes may be retroactive to previous periods and as a result could negatively affect Customers' current and future financial performance. In December 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law, which resulted in significant changes to the Code. The Tax Act reduced Customers' Federal corporate income tax rate to 21% beginning in 2018. However, the Tax Act also imposed limitations on Customers' ability to take certain deductions, such as the deduction for FDIC deposit insurance premiums, which partially offset the increase in net income from the lower tax rate.\nIn addition, a number of the changes to the Code were introduced through the CARES Act and the CAA, and some of the provisions are set to expire in future years. There is substantial uncertainty concerning whether those expiring provisions will be extended, or whether future legislation will further revise the Code. Also, the current administration has indicated it may propose increases to the federal corporate statutory tax rate. An increase in the federal corporate tax rate may increase our tax provision expense. We are unable to predict whether these changes, or other proposals, will ultimately be enacted.\nWe are Subject to Regulatory Restrictions on Transactions with Our Affiliates and Related Parties. Failure to Comply with Such Regulations Could Materially and Adversely Affect Us.\nThere are various legal restrictions on the extent to which the Company may borrow or otherwise engage in certain types of transactions with the Bank or their respective affiliates and related parties. Under the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve\u2019s Regulation W, the Bank is subject to quantitative and qualitative limits on extensions of credit (including credit exposure arising from repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowing and derivative transactions), purchases of assets, and certain other transactions with the Company or its other affiliates. Additionally, transactions between the Bank, on the one hand, and the Company or its affiliates, on the other hand, are required to be on arm\u2019s length terms. Transactions between the Bank and its affiliates must be consistent with standards of safety and soundness. The Bank has had, and may be expected to have in the future, banking and other business transactions in the ordinary course of business with affiliates of the Company and the Bank, and their respective executive officers, directors, principal shareholders, their immediate families and affiliated companies (commonly referred to as related parties). The failure of the\nCompany or the Bank to comply with the regulatory restrictions applicable to Customers and the Bank could materially and adversely affect the Company and the Bank.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nRisks Related to Our Voting Common Stock\nThe trading volume in our common stock may generally be less than that of other larger financial services companies.\nAlthough the shares of our common stock are listed on the NYSE, the trading volume in our common stock may generally be less than that of many other larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends upon the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time, which presence will be dependent upon the individual decisions of investors, over which we have no control. Illiquidity of the stock market, or in the trading of our common stock on the NYSE, could have a material adverse effect on the value of your shares, particularly if significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of significant sales, were to occur.\nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and our ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory limitations.\nWe have not historically declared nor paid cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not expect to do so in the near future. Any future determination relating to our dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors, including earnings and financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements, the general economic and regulatory climate, the ability to service any equity or debt obligations senior to the common stock, our planned growth in assets and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors. We must be current in the payment of dividends to holders of our Series E and Series F Preferred Stock before any dividends can be paid on our common stock.\nIn addition, as a bank holding company, we are subject to general regulatory restrictions on the payment of cash and in-kind dividends. Federal bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business, which, depending on the financial condition and liquidity of the holding company at the time, could include the payment of dividends. Further, various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends that our bank subsidiary can pay to us as its holding company without regulatory approval. See \u201cMarket Price of Common Stock and Dividends - Dividends on Common Stock\u201d below for further detail regarding restrictions on our ability to pay dividends.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock in the future which could adversely affect the value or voting power of our outstanding common stock.\nActual or anticipated issuances or sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the future could cause the value of our common stock to decline significantly and make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and on terms that we deem appropriate. The issuance of any shares of our common stock in the future also would, and equity-related securities could, dilute the percentage ownership interest held by shareholders prior to such issuance. Actual issuances of our common stock could also significantly dilute the voting power of the common stock.\nWe have also made grants of restricted stock units and stock options with respect to shares of our common stock to our directors and certain team members. We may also issue further equity-based awards in the future. As such shares are issued upon vesting and as such options may be exercised and the underlying shares are or become freely tradeable, the value or voting power of our common stock may be adversely affected, and our ability to sell more equity or equity-related securities could also be adversely affected.\nAt December 31, 2021, we are not required to issue any additional equity securities to existing holders of our common stock on a preemptive basis. Therefore, additional common stock issuances, directly or through convertible or exchangeable securities, warrants or options, will generally dilute the holdings of our existing holders of common stock, and such issuances or the perception of such issuances may reduce the market price of our common stock. Our outstanding preferred stock has preference on distribution payments, periodically or upon liquidation, which could eliminate or otherwise limit our ability to make distributions to holders of our common stock. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities or incur other borrowings in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, the amount, timing, nature or success of our future capital-raising efforts is uncertain. Thus, holders of our common stock bear the risk that our future issuances of debt or equity securities or our incurrence of other borrowings will negatively affect the value of our common stock.\nFuture issuances of debt securities, which would rank senior to our common stock upon our liquidation, and future issuances of equity securities, which would dilute the holdings of our existing holders of common stock and may be senior to our common stock for the purposes of making distributions, periodically or upon liquidation, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may issue additional debt or equity securities or incur other borrowings. Upon our liquidation, holders of our debt securities and other loans and preferred stock will receive a distribution of our available assets before holders of our common stock. If we incur debt in the future, our future interest costs could increase and adversely affect our liquidity, cash flows and results of operations.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit a takeover of us, which could discourage transactions that would otherwise be in the best interests of our shareholders and could entrench management.\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and applicable provisions of Pennsylvania law and the federal CBCA may delay, inhibit or prevent someone from gaining control of our business through a tender offer, business combination, proxy contest or some other method even though some of our shareholders might believe a change in control is desirable. They might also increase the costs of completing a transaction in which we acquire another financial services business, merge with another financial institution or sell our business to another financial institution. These increased costs could reduce the value of the shares held by our shareholders upon completion of these types of transactions.\nShareholders may be deemed to be acting in concert or otherwise in control of us and our bank subsidiaries, which could impose prior approval requirements and result in adverse regulatory consequences for such holders.\nWe are a bank holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve. Any entity (including a \u201cgroup\u201d composed of natural persons) owning 25% or more of a class of our outstanding shares of voting stock, or a lesser percentage if such holder or group otherwise exercises a \u201ccontrolling influence\u201d over us, may be subject to regulation as a \u201cbank holding company\u201d in accordance with the BHCA. In addition, (i) any bank holding company or foreign bank with a U.S. presence is required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve under the BHCA to acquire or retain 5% or more of a class of our outstanding shares of voting stock and (ii) any person other than a bank holding company may be required to obtain prior regulatory approval under the CBCA to acquire or retain 10% or more of our outstanding shares of voting stock. Any shareholder that is deemed to \u201ccontrol\u201d the company for bank regulatory purposes would become subject to prior approval requirements and ongoing regulation and supervision. Such a holder may be required to divest amounts equal to or exceeding 5% of the voting shares of investments that may be deemed incompatible with bank holding company status, such as an investment in a company engaged in non-financial activities. Regulatory determination of \u201ccontrol\u201d of a depository institution or holding company is based on all of the relevant facts and circumstances. Potential investors are advised to consult with their legal counsel regarding the applicable regulations and requirements.\nOur common stock owned by holders determined by a bank regulatory agency to be acting in concert would be aggregated for purposes of determining whether those holders have control of a bank or bank holding company. Each shareholder obtaining control that is a \u201ccompany\u201d would be required to register as a bank holding company. \u201cActing in concert\u201d generally means knowing participation in a joint activity or parallel action towards the common goal of acquiring control of a bank or a parent company, whether or not pursuant to an express agreement. The manner in which this definition is applied in individual circumstances can vary and cannot always be predicted with certainty. Many factors can lead to a finding of acting in concert, including where: (i) the shareholders are commonly controlled or managed; (ii) the shareholders are parties to an oral or written agreement or understanding regarding the acquisition, voting or transfer of control of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company; (iii) the shareholders each own stock in a bank and are also management officials, controlling shareholders, partners or trustees of another company or (iv) both a shareholder and a controlling shareholder, partner, trustee or management official of such shareholder own equity in the bank or bank holding company.\nOur directors and executive officers can influence the outcome of shareholder votes and, in some cases, shareholders may not have the opportunity to evaluate and affect the investment decision regarding potential investment, acquisition or disposition transactions.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our directors and executive officers, as a group, owned a total of 1,985,108 shares of common stock and exercisable options to purchase up to an additional 100,000 shares of common stock, which potentially gives them, as a group, the ability to control approximately 6.34% of the outstanding common stock. In addition, two directors of Customers Bank who are not directors of Customers Bancorp own an additional 142,158 shares of common stock, which if combined with the directors and officers of Customers Bancorp, potentially gives them, as a group, the ability to control approximately 6.77% of the outstanding common stock. We believe ownership of stock causes directors and officers to have the same interests as shareholders, but it also gives them the ability to vote as shareholders for matters that are in their personal interest, which may be contrary to the wishes of other shareholders. Shareholders will not necessarily be provided with an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of one or more potential investment, acquisition or disposition transactions. Any decision regarding a potential investment or acquisition transaction will be made by our board of\ndirectors. Except in limited circumstances as required by applicable law, consummation of an acquisition will not require the approval of holders of common stock. Accordingly, shareholders may not have an opportunity to evaluate and affect the board of directors' decision regarding most potential investment or acquisition transactions and/or certain disposition transactions.\nThe FDIC\u2019s policy statement imposing restrictions and criteria on private investors in failed bank acquisitions will apply to us and our investors.\nIn August 2009, the FDIC issued a policy statement imposing restrictions and criteria on private investors in failed bank acquisitions. The policy statement is broad in scope and both complex and potentially ambiguous in its application. In most cases, it would apply to an investor with more than 5% of the total voting power of an acquired depository institution or its holding company; but in certain circumstances, it could apply to investors holding fewer voting shares. The policy statement will be applied to us if we make additional failed bank acquisitions from the FDIC or if the FDIC changes its interpretation of the policy statement or determines at some future date that it should be applied because of our circumstances.\nInvestors subject to the policy statement could be prohibited from selling or transferring their interests for three years. They also would be required to provide the FDIC with information about the investor and all entities in the investor\u2019s ownership chain, including information on the size of the capital fund or funds, its diversification, its return profile, its marketing documents, and its management team and business model. Investors owning 80% or more of two or more banks or savings associations would be required to pledge their proportionate interests in each institution to cross-guarantee the FDIC against losses to the DIF.\nUnder the policy statement, the FDIC also could prohibit investment through ownership structures involving multiple investment vehicles that are owned or controlled by the same parent company. Investors that directly or indirectly hold 10% or more of the equity of a bank or savings association in receivership also would not be eligible to bid to become investors in the deposit liabilities of that failed institution. In addition, an investor using ownership structures with entities that are domiciled in bank-secrecy jurisdictions would not be eligible to own a direct or indirect interest in an insured depository institution unless the investor\u2019s parent company is subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision as recognized by the Federal Reserve, and the investor enters into certain agreements with the U.S. bank regulators regarding access to information, maintenance of records and compliance with U.S. banking laws and regulations. If the policy statement applies, we (including any failed bank we acquire) could be required to maintain a ratio of Tier 1 common equity to total assets of at least 10% for a period of three years and thereafter maintain a capital level sufficient to be well capitalized under regulatory standards during the remaining period of ownership of the investors. Bank subsidiaries also may be prohibited from extending any new credit to investors that own at least 10% of our equity.\nRisks Related to Our Fixed-to-Floating-Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series E and Series F\nThe shares of our Series E and Series F Preferred Stock are equity securities and are subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness.\nThe shares of Series E and Series F Preferred Stock are equity interests in Customers Bancorp and do not constitute indebtedness of Customers Bancorp or any of our subsidiaries and rank junior to all of our existing and future indebtedness and other non-equity claims with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against us, including claims in the event of our liquidation. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of Series C and Series D Preferred Stock. If we are forced to liquidate our assets to pay our creditors, we may not have sufficient funds to pay amounts due on any or all of the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock then outstanding.\nWe may not pay dividends on the shares of Series E and Series F Preferred Stock.\nDividends on the shares of Series E and Series F Preferred Stock are payable only if declared by our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of the board. As a bank holding company, we are subject to general regulatory restrictions on the payment of cash dividends. Federal bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business, which, depending on the financial condition and liquidity of the holding company at the time, could include the payment of dividends. Further, various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends that our bank subsidiary can pay to us as its holding company without regulatory approval.\nDividends on the shares of Series E and Series F Preferred Stock are non-cumulative.\nDividends on the shares of Series E and Series F Preferred Stock are payable only when, as and if authorized and declared by our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of the board. Consequently, if our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of the board does not authorize and declare a dividend for any dividend period, holders of the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock will not be entitled to receive any such dividend, and such unpaid dividend will cease to accrue or be payable. If we do not declare and pay\ndividends on the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock, the market prices of the shares of Series E and Series F Preferred Stock may decline.\nOur ability to pay dividends on the shares of Series E and Series F Preferred Stock is dependent on dividends and distributions we receive from our subsidiaries, which are subject to regulatory and other limitations.\nOur principal source of cash flow is dividends from Customers Bank. We cannot assure you that Customers Bank will, in any circumstances, pay dividends to us. If Customers Bank fails to make dividend payments or other permitted distributions to us, and sufficient cash is not otherwise available, we may not be able to make dividend payments on the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock. Various federal and state statutes, regulations and rules limit, directly or indirectly, the amount of dividends that our banking and other subsidiaries may pay to us without regulatory approval. In particular, dividend and other distributions from Customers Bank to us would require notice to or approval of the applicable regulatory authority. There can be no assurances that we would receive such approval.\nIn addition, our right to participate in any distribution of assets of any of our subsidiaries upon the subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or otherwise, and, as a result, the ability of a holder of Series E and Series F Preferred Stock to benefit indirectly from such distribution, will be subject to the prior claims of preferred equity holders and creditors of that subsidiary, except to the extent that any of our claims as a creditor of such subsidiary may be recognized. As a result, shares of the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and any outstanding preferred equity of our subsidiaries.\nHolders of Series E and Series F Preferred Stock should not expect us to redeem their shares when they first become redeemable at our option or on any particular date thereafter, and our ability to redeem the shares will be subject to the prior approval of the Federal Reserve.\nOur Series E and Series F Preferred Stock are perpetual equity securities, meaning that they have no maturity date or mandatory redemption date, and the shares are not redeemable at the option of the holders thereof. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of Series C and Series D Preferred Stock. However, any determination we make at any time to propose a redemption of the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock will depend upon a number of factors, including our evaluation of our capital position, the composition of our shareholders\u2019 equity and general market conditions at that time. In addition, our right to redeem the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock is subject to any limitations established by the Federal Reserve. Under the Federal Reserve\u2019s risk-based capital guidelines applicable to bank holding companies, any redemption of the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock is subject to prior approval of the Federal Reserve. There can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve will approve any such redemption.\nWe may be able to redeem the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock before their initial redemption dates upon a \u201cregulatory capital treatment event.\u201d\nWe may be able to redeem the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock before their respective initial redemption dates, in whole but not in part, upon the occurrence of certain events involving the capital treatment of the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock, as applicable. In particular, upon our determination in good faith that an event has occurred that would constitute a \u201cregulatory capital treatment event,\u201d with respect to a particular series of the preferred stock, we may redeem that particular series of securities in whole, but not in part, upon the prior approval of the Federal Reserve.\nHolders of Series E and Series F Preferred stock have limited voting rights.\nHolders of Series E and Series F Preferred Stock have no voting rights with respect to matters that generally require the approval of voting shareholders. However, holders of Series E and Series F Preferred Stock will have the right to vote in the event of non-payments of dividends under certain circumstances, with respect to authorizing classes or series of preferred stock senior to the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock, as applicable, and with respect to certain fundamental changes in the terms of the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock, as applicable, or as otherwise required by law.\nGeneral market conditions and unpredictable factors could adversely affect market prices for the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock.\nThere can be no assurance regarding the market prices for the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock. A variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, could influence the market prices, including:\n\u2022whether we declare or fail to declare dividends on the series of preferred stock from time to time;\n\u2022our operating performance, financial condition and prospects or the operating performance, financial condition and prospects of our competitors;\n\u2022real or anticipated changes in the credit ratings (if any) assigned to the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock or our other securities;\n\u2022our creditworthiness;\n\u2022changes in interest rates and expectations regarding changes in rates;\n\u2022our issuance of additional preferred equity;\n\u2022the market for similar securities;\n\u2022developments in the securities, credit and housing markets, and developments with respect to financial institutions generally; and\n\u2022economic, financial, corporate, securities market, geopolitical, regulatory or judicial events that affect us, the banking industry or the financial markets generally.\nThe Series E and Series F Preferred Stock may not have an active trading market.\nAlthough the shares of Series E and Series F Preferred Stock are listed on the NYSE, an active trading market may not be established or maintained for the shares, and transaction costs could be high. As a result, the difference between bid and ask prices in any secondary market could be substantial.\nThe Series E and Series F Preferred Stock may be junior or equal in rights and preferences to preferred stock we may issue in the future.\nOur Series E and Series F Preferred Stock rank equally. Although we do not currently have outstanding preferred stock that ranks senior to the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock, the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock may rank junior to other preferred stock we may issue in the future that by its terms is expressly senior in rights and preferences to the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock, although the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of all outstanding shares of the affected class of preferred stock is required to issue any shares of stock ranking senior in rights and preferences to such class. Any preferred stock that ranks senior to the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock in the future would have priority in payment of dividends and the making of distributions in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Customers Bancorp. Additional issuances by us of preferred stock ranking equally with Series E and Series F Preferred Stock do not generally require the approval of holders of the Series E and Series F Preferred Stock.\nRisks Related to Our Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes\nOur 2.875% Senior Notes, 4.5% Senior Notes, 3.95% Senior Notes, 6.125% Subordinated Notes and 5.375% Subordinated Notes contain limited covenants.\nThe terms of our 2.875% Senior Notes, 4.5% Senior Notes and 3.95% Senior Notes, which we refer to as the Senior Notes, and 6.125% and 5.375% Subordinated Notes, which we refer to as the Subordinated Notes, generally do not prohibit us from incurring additional debt or other liabilities. If we incur additional debt or liabilities, our ability to pay our obligations on the Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes could be adversely affected. In addition, the terms of our Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes do not require us to maintain any financial ratios or specific levels of net worth, revenues, income, cash flows or liquidity and, accordingly, do not protect holders of those notes in the event that we experience material adverse changes in our financial condition or results of operations. Holders of the Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes also have limited protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction, reorganization, default under our existing indebtedness, restructuring, merger or similar transaction.\nOur ability to make interest and principal payments on the Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes is dependent on dividends and distributions we receive from our subsidiaries, which are subject to regulatory and other limitations.\nOur principal source of cash flow is dividends from Customers Bank. We cannot assure you that Customers Bank will, in any circumstances, pay dividends to us. If Customers Bank fails to make dividend payments to us, and sufficient cash is not otherwise available, we may not be able to make interest and principal payments on the Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes. Various federal and state statutes, regulations and rules limit, directly or indirectly, the amount of dividends that our banking and other subsidiaries may pay to us without regulatory approval. In particular, dividend and other distributions from Customers Bank to us would require notice to or approval of the applicable regulatory authority. There can be no assurances that we would receive such approval.\nIn addition, our right to participate in any distribution of assets of any of our subsidiaries upon the subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or otherwise, and, as a result, the ability of a holder of the 2.875% Senior Notes, 4.5% Senior Notes and 3.95% Senior Notes to benefit indirectly from such distribution will be subject to the prior claims of preferred equity holders and creditors of that subsidiary, except to the extent that\nany of our claims as a creditor of such subsidiary may be recognized. As a result, the 2.875% Senior Notes, 4.5% Senior Notes and 3.95% Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and any outstanding preferred equity of our subsidiaries.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations, including our obligations under the Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes will depend on our financial and operating performance, including dividends payable to us from Customers Bank, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the notes.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources and dividends from Customers Bank are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be unable to provide new loans, other products or to fund our obligations to existing customers and otherwise implement our business plans. As a result, we may be unable to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of sufficient operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations or seek to restructure our indebtedness, including the notes. We may not be able to consummate these transactions, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations when due.\nThe Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes are our unsecured obligations. The Senior Notes will rank equal in right of payment with all of our secured and unsecured senior indebtedness and will rank senior in right of payment to all of our subordinated indebtedness. Although the Senior Notes are \u201csenior notes,\u201d they will be effectively subordinate to all liabilities of our subsidiaries. Because the Senior Notes are unsecured, they will be effectively subordinated to all of our future secured senior indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.\nThe Subordinated Notes will rank equal in right of payment with all of our secured and unsecured subordinated indebtedness and will rank junior in right of payment to all of our senior indebtedness, including the Senior Notes. As is the case with the Senior Notes, the Subordinated Notes are effectively subordinated to all liabilities of our subsidiaries. Because the Subordinated Notes are unsecured, they will be effectively subordinated to all of our future secured subordinated indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.\nThe Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes may not have an active trading market.\nThe Senior Notes and 6.125% Subordinated Notes are not listed on any securities exchange, and there is no active trading market for these notes. Although the 5.375% Subordinated Notes are listed on the NYSE, there is no guarantee that a trading market will develop or be maintained. In addition to the other factors described below, the lack of a trading market for the Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes may adversely affect the holder\u2019s ability to sell the notes and the prices at which the notes may be sold.\nThe prices realizable from sales of the Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes in any secondary market also will be affected by the supply and demand of the notes, the interest rate, the ranking and a number of other factors, including:\n\u2022yields on U.S. Treasury obligations and expectations about future interest rates;\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes in our financial condition or results, including our levels of indebtedness;\n\u2022general economic conditions and expectations regarding the effects of national policies;\n\u2022investors\u2019 views of securities issued by both holding companies and similar financial service firms; and\n\u2022the market for similar securities.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nDowngrades in U.S. government and federal agency securities could adversely affect us.\nThe long-term impact of the downgrade of the U.S. government and federal agencies from an AAA to an AA+ credit rating is still uncertain. However, in addition to causing economic and financial market disruptions, the downgrade, and any future downgrades and/or failures to raise the U.S. debt limit if necessary in the future, could, among other things, materially adversely affect the market value of the U.S. and other government and governmental agency securities owned by us, the availability of those securities as collateral for borrowing and our ability to access capital markets on favorable terms, as well as have other material adverse effects on the operation of our business and our financial results and condition. In particular, it could increase interest rates and disrupt payment systems, money\nmarkets, and long-term or short-term fixed-income markets, adversely affecting the cost and availability of funding, which could negatively affect profitability. Also, the adverse consequences as a result of the downgrade could extend to the borrowers of the loans we make and, as a result, could adversely affect our borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans.\nWe may not be able to maintain consistent earnings or profitability.\nAlthough we made profit for the years 2011 through 2021, there can be no assurance that we will be able to remain profitable in future periods, or, if profitable, that our overall earnings will remain consistent or increase in the future. Our earnings also may be reduced by increased expenses associated with increased assets, such as additional team member compensation expense, and increased interest expense on any liabilities incurred or deposits solicited to fund increases in assets. If earnings do not grow proportionately with our assets or equity, our overall profitability may be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 13921, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CUBI"}
