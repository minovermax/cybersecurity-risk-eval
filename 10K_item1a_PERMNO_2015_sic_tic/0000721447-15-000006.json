{"cik": "721447", "company": "CCA INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nConcentration of Risk.\nThe Company relies on mass merchandisers and major food and drug chains for the sales of its products. The loss of any one of those accounts or substantial reduction of sales revenues realized from their business could have a material negative impact upon our financial condition and results of operations. All of the Company\u2019s products have independent competition and must be able to compete in order to maintain the Company's position on the retail merchandisers\u2019 shelves. (See Business-General, Item 1 (c) Marketing.)\nWe are Dependent on Independent Contract Manufacturers.\nThe Company does not manufacture any of its products. All of the products are manufactured for the Company by independent contract manufacturers. There can be no assurance that these independent contract manufacturers will manufacture our products in the time, in accordance with our specifications or at the level of quality expected. There can be no assurance that the failure of a supplier to deliver the products ordered by the Company, when requested, will not cause burdensome delays in the Company\u2019s shipments to its customers. The Company does constantly seek alternative suppliers should a major supplier fail to deliver as contracted. A failure of the Company to ship as ordered by its customers could cause penalties and/or cancellations of our customers\u2019 orders. In addition, an unanticipated need to transition to a new supplier could result in delays that could impact timely distribution of our products. Any of the foregoing events, depending upon the timing and particular circumstances, could have a material adverse impact on our relationships with our customers and our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nThere is No Assurance That The Business Will Be Able to Operate Profitably.\nIn fiscal 2014, net sales were $30,120,299 with a net loss from continuing operations of $2,803,428 and a net loss from discontinued operations a loss of $5,996,041, for a total net loss of $8,799,469. There is no assurance that the Company\u2019s products will be successful. During fiscal 2014, the Company discontinued its Gel Perfect nail polish brand and sold its Mega-T dietary supplement brand, and consumer confidence continued to be low, which had a general impact on the industry and retail sales.\nWe may experience periods of declines in sales, especially during periods of economic downturn, and any material reduction in our sales could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nAdditional risk factors for consideration:\nWe continue to execute our turnaround strategy and there is no assurance that our sales trends and operating results may not take longer to recover than planned, which would impact our future operating results and cash flows.\nOur operating plan contemplates improvement in our operating results for 2015 and beyond. We are in a turnaround, our initiatives designed to improve our sales and operating results are still in the early stages which adds challenges and uncertainty, and we incurred a significant operating loss in fiscal 2013 and 2014. There can be no assurance that our past sales trends and operating results may not continue longer than we expect or may take longer to recover than we have planned or that we will achieve our operating plan, which would negatively impact revenues, operating results and cash flows. Our existing credit facility expires on December 5, 2015, unless it is renewed or extended, which we cannot assure. As a result there is no assurance that our cash from operations and credit from external sources will at all times be sufficient for all of our operating requirements and other cash requirements. If this were to occur, we would closely monitor our operating performance and our liquidity and take actions designed to improve our liquidity and mitigate any shortfall and potentially seek other or additional financing and seek to take other actions, although there can be no assurance that any of these actions would be successful or that any such additional liquidity, if needed, would be available or obtainable on sufficient or favorable terms, which would materially and adversely affect our operating results, liquidity, financial position and business.\nWe depend on our existing credit facility, which expires on December 5, 2015, unless extended or renewed, which we cannot assure.\nDuring 2014 we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Capital Preservation Solutions, LLC for a $5,000,000 working capital line of credit and a term loan for working capital purposes not to exceed $1,000,000.\nThis credit agreement is due to expire by its terms on December 5, 2015, unless renewed or extended for a subsequent period, which we cannot assure. If this credit facility is not extended or renewed beyond its current term, we would seek to obtain other credit facilities to replace it. However, we cannot assure that another credit facility would be available or sufficient for our cash needs or, if available, would be on favorable terms. If our existing credit facility, which is secured by all of our material assets, is not extended or renewed or replaced as of its expiration date with another sufficient credit facility, it is likely we may not have sufficient available cash resources to satisfy such outstanding amount in full on its due date, which would have a material and adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position and business.\nThe Company Could Face Liquidity Pressure and is Dependent on Capital Preservation Solutions, LLC to Provide Liquidity.\nOn September 5, 2014, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) with Capital Preservation Solutions, LLC (\u201cCapital\u201d) for a $5,000,000 working capital line of credit and a term loan for working capital purposes not to exceed $1,000,000. The line of credit and term loan have an interest rate of 6% and mature on December 5, 2015. The advances made under the Agreement are subject to a borrowing base calculation that includes 80% of the eligible accounts receivable plus 50% of the value of the eligible inventory. All amounts outstanding under the Agreement are secured by a first priority security interest in all of the assets of the Company. As of November 30, 2014, we had $1,000,000 outstanding under the term loan and $600,000 outstanding under the line of credit. Assuming the continuation of this credit facility over at least the next twelve months and assuming the achievement of the expected benefits of the Company\u2019s outsourcing and restructuring plan, the Company does not anticipate that it will experience liquidity problems during fiscal 2015. The Company currently does not have material overdue outstanding balances with any of its vendors.\nIf Capital fails to provide the Company with funds under the Agreement as required, if our borrowing availability under the line of credit is limited under the borrowing base calculation or if the term loan and line of credit are not extended, the Company could experience liquidity issues and might not be able to pay its obligations on a timely basis. The term loan contains customary events of default, including failing to pay interest or principle amounts when due, if the Company becomes bankrupt or insolvent, the dissolution of the Company and certain other events more fully described in the Loan and Security Agreement filed with the 8-K by the Company on September 11, 2014. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, Capital may elect to declare the entire unpaid principal balance of the term loan and line of credit to be immediately due and payable, together with interest and all costs incurred by Capital under the loan agreement. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and development efforts will depend on our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of our outsourcing and restructuring plan and our ability to generate cash in the future from our operations which cannot be assured. These items, to a certain extent, are dependent upon industry conditions, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThere is no assurance that our term loan or line of credit will be extended or that we will be able to obtain financing or access the capital markets for future debt or refinancing opportunities in a timely manner, or on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to borrow funds, we may be unable to make the capital expenditures necessary for us to compete with our competitors or take advantage of new business opportunities. As a result, the lack of such funding could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and our ability to service our indebtedness.\nThe Company is Dependent on Outsourced Core Function Vendors\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2014, management approved and began implementing the Company's outsourcing agreements with the Emerson Group, which includes sales, customer service, accounts receivable collection functions, warehousing and shipping functions. While there are other vendors that provide these services, which could be sought as alternative vendors, any disruption in our sales, shipments, collections or any other core outsourced function, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and business.\nThe Fast Moving Consumer Goods Segment is Highly Competitive.\nThe market for cosmetics and perfumes, and health-and-beauty aids products in general, including patent medicines, is characterized by vigorous competition among producers, many of whom have substantially greater financial, technological and marketing resources than the Company. Major competitors such as Revlon, L\u2019Oreal,\nColgate-Palmolive, Coty, Unilever, and Procter & Gamble have the broadest-based public recognition of their products and are significantly larger than the Company. Moreover, a substantial number of other health-and-beauty aids manufacturers and distributors may also have greater resources than the Company and may therefore have the ability to spend more aggressively on research and development, advertising and marketing, and to respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions. Our inability to successfully compete with our competitors could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operation and business.\nOur Class A Shareholders Retain Control of Board of Directors.\nClass A Shareholder, Capital Preservation Holdings, LLC has the right to elect four members to the Board of Directors. Capital Preservation Holdings, LLC is controlled by Lance Funston. Richard Kornhauser, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, and Stephen A. Heit, the Chief Financial Officer, have an ownership interest in Capital Preservation Holdings, LLC. As a result, they are able to exert significant influence over our business. The holders of Common Stock have the right to elect three members to the Board of Directors.\nFuture Success Depends on Continued Success of the Company\u2019s Current Products and New Product Development.\nThe Company is not financially as strong as the major companies against whom it competes. The ability to successfully introduce new niche products and increase the growth and profitability of its current and new niche brand products will affect the business and prospects of the future of the Company and this ability is dependent upon the creativity and marketing skills of management and its advisors and business partners.\nAll of the Company\u2019s product must be in compliance with all FDA and state regulations and all products which are being manufactured for the Company by outside suppliers must conform to the FDA\u2019s Good Manufacturing Practices requirements. It is the Company\u2019s responsibility to ascertain that the suppliers conform with these requirements. Damage could be caused to our reputation and our relationships with our customers and consumers if our products do not comply with such legal requirements, or with consumer expectations, which could result in diminished sales or liability claims, either of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nThe Company Relies On A Few Large Customers For A Significant Portion Of Its Sales.\nIn fiscal 2014, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. represented 47.0% of the Company\u2019s net sales. The Company\u2019s five largest customers accounted for 67.3% of the Company\u2019s net sales. The Company has no agreements with any of its customers to stock its products. The Company\u2019s business would suffer materially if it lost Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. as a customer. The loss of any significant reduction in sales to any of the Company\u2019s five top customers could likely have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Price of the Company\u2019s Stock May Be Volatile.\nThe Company\u2019s stock could fluctuate substantially. There is a limited float of shares tradable. There are factors beyond the Company\u2019s control which may cause the market price of our stock to fluctuate significantly, including but not limited to the volatility of small cap stocks in general, general stock market conditions, and general economic variations. In addition, variations in the Company\u2019s operating revenues and profits and the timing of advertising commitments also may have an effect on the market price of the Company\u2019s stock.\nClimate Change Effects.\nThe Company continues to monitor climate changes for any potential impact on its business. At this time, the Company does not anticipate that any climate change or climate change regulations will have a material impact on its operations or business.\nThe Company May Experience Interruptions to Its Business Operations Due to Events Beyond Its Control\nA catastrophic event beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as a natural disaster, health pandemic, cyber attack, adverse weather event or act of terrorism, that results in the destruction or disruption of any of the Company\u2019s critical business systems or operations could harm its ability to conduct normal business operations and its operating results.\nWe Depend on Key Personnel.\nOur employees are key to the growth and success of our business. This depends, in large part, on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, including our executive officers and key management personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe Future Growth of the Company Depends on an Effective Marketing Program.\nAn effective marketing program includes media advertising, in-store merchandising and enhancing distribution, co-operative advertising with our retail partners and product promotions that increase product availability, awareness, and help generate increased sales for our customers. Our inability to develop and implement effective advertising campaign, marketing or promotional programs, that will succeed in a difficult economic environment and highly competitive marketplace, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe Sell to International Accounts.\nIn fiscal 2014, international sales accounted for approximately 13.6% of our total net sales with shipments to our Canadian distributor accounting for approximately 2.4% of our total net sales. Our international sales expose the Company to additional risks associated with political or regulatory conditions, the dependence on other economies and foreign currency fluctuations which may diminish demand for U.S. goods and subject us to adverse translation impact. A terrorist attack, the threat of a terrorist attack or foreign military operations or other catastrophic event beyond the Company's control could prevent us from shipping to our international accounts. A loss of or material reduction in our international sales would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe Purchase Some Raw Materials or Components from International Suppliers.\nSome of the components used in our products are sourced from international suppliers either by the Company directly or through our turn-key supplier, Suite-K. This exposes the Company to an additional risk of increased costs if the foreign currency exchange rates change unfavorably. A terrorist attack, the threat of a terrorist attack or foreign military operations or other catastrophic event beyond the Company's control could prevent the international suppliers from delivering their goods to the Company or Suite-K. The interruption of the supply could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe Have Entered into Employment and Change of Control Agreements that would Require Us to Make Substantial Payments in connection with a Change of Control of the Company.\nThe Company has entered into Employment Agreements with Stephen A. Heit, the Company's Chief Financial Officer and Elias Ciudad, Executive Vice President - Information Technology (the \u201cExecutives\u201d). The Employment Agreements may, in the event of termination of employment under certain circumstances or a change of control of the Company, result in a lump sum payment equal to three times the Executive\u2019s base annual salary and prior year bonus plus other benefits. As a result, if the Company was required to make a substantial payment to the Executives under these agreements, there would be a significant impact on the Company\u2019s cash reserves and earnings.
