{"cik": "1196298", "company": "NEPHROS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Company\nWe have a history of operating losses and a significant accumulated deficit, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $127,332,000 as a result of historical operating losses. While we believe that the revenues following the launch of our new products will help us achieve profitability, there can be no guarantee of this. We may continue to incur additional losses in the future depending on the timing and marketplace acceptance of our products and as a result of operating expenses being higher than our gross margin from product sales. We began sales of our first product in March 2004, and we may never realize sufficient revenues from the sale of our products or be profitable. Each of the following factors, among others, may influence the timing and extent of our profitability, if any:\n\u25cf the market acceptance of our technologies and products in each of our target markets;\n\u25cf our ability to effectively and efficiently manufacture, market and distribute our products;\n\u25cf our ability to sell our products at competitive prices that exceed our per unit costs; and\n\u25cf our ability to continue to develop products and maintain a competitive advantage in our industry.\nThe recent coronavirus outbreak in Italy may impact our supply chain, which could adversely affect our sales and revenues if we are unable to obtain sufficient inventory of products.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. As of February 2020, the virus has spread to Italy, which reportedly has the highest number of coronavirus infections outside Asia. We currently source substantially all of our products from Medica, which is located in Italy. As such, the outbreak of the coronavirus could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These effects could include disruptions from the temporary closure of third-party supplier and manufacturer facilities, or restrictions on the export or shipment of products. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others.\nIf we violate any provisions of the FDC Act or any other statutes or regulations, then we could be subject to enforcement actions by the FDA or other governmental agencies.\nWe face a significant compliance burden under the FDC Act and other applicable statutes and regulations which govern the testing, labeling, storage, record keeping, distribution, sale, marketing, advertising and promotion of our medically approved products. If we violate the FDC Act or other regulatory requirements (either with respect to our ultrafilters or otherwise) at any time during or after the product development and/or approval process, we could be subject to enforcement actions by the FDA or other agencies, including:\n\u25cf fines;\n\u25cf injunctions;\n\u25cf civil penalties;\n\u25cf recalls or seizures of products;\n\u25cf total or partial suspension of the production of our products;\n\u25cf withdrawal of any existing approvals or pre-market clearances of our products;\n\u25cf refusal to approve or clear new applications or notices relating to our products;\n\u25cf recommendations that we not be allowed to enter into government contracts; and\n\u25cf criminal prosecution.\nAny of the above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Aether Acquisition may not produce the desired outcomes and expected value.\nWe purchased Aether to increase our revenues and to provide an entry to new markets, with particular focus on hospitality, food service, and convenience stores. However, any acquisition carries risks, including:\n\u25cf Issues of concern that were missed during due diligence activities;\n\u25cf Sales to existing Aether customers may not increase as planned;\n\u25cf Our target markets may be more difficult to grow than anticipated;\n\u25cf Difficulties could emerge while integrating the two companies and their work forces; and\n\u25cf Key employees could leave.\nAs such, we cannot guarantee any specific results from the Aether Acquisition; and if the anticipated outcomes do not occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially impacted.\nWe cannot assure you that our products will be safe or that there will not be product-related deaths, serious injuries or product malfunctions. Further, we are required under applicable law to report any circumstances relating to our medically approved products that could result in deaths or serious injuries. These circumstances could trigger recalls, class action lawsuits and other events that could cause us to incur expenses and may also limit our ability to generate revenues from such products.\nWe cannot assure you that our products will prove to be safe or that there will not be product-related deaths or serious injuries or product malfunctions, which could trigger recalls, class action lawsuits and other events that could cause us to incur significant expenses, limit our ability to market our products and generate revenues from such products or cause us reputational harm. Under the FDC Act, we are required to submit medical device reports (\u201cMDRs\u201d) to the FDA to report device-related deaths, serious injuries and malfunctions of medically approved products that could result in death or serious injury if they were to recur. Depending on their significance, MDRs could trigger events that could cause us to incur expenses and may also limit our ability to generate revenues from such products. Additionally, any of the following could occur:\n\u25cf information contained in the MDRs could trigger FDA regulatory actions such as inspections, recalls and patient/physician notifications;\n\u25cf because the reports are publicly available, MDRs could become the basis for private lawsuits, including class actions; and\n\u25cf if we fail to submit a required MDR to the FDA, the FDA could take enforcement action against us.\nIf any of these events occur, then we could incur significant expenses and it could become more difficult for us to market and sell our products and to generate revenues from sales. Other countries may impose analogous reporting requirements that could cause us to incur expenses and may also limit our ability to generate revenues from sales of our products.\nProduct liability associated with the production, marketing and sale of our products, and/or the expense of defending against claims of product liability, could materially deplete our assets and generate negative publicity which could impair our reputation.\nThe production, marketing and sale of kidney dialysis and water-filtration products have inherent risks of liability in the event of product failure or claim of harm caused by product operation. Voluntary recalls could subject us to claims or proceedings by consumers, the FDA or other regulatory authorities which may adversely impact our sales and revenues. Furthermore, even meritless claims of product liability may be costly to defend against. Although we have acquired product liability insurance for our products, we may not be able to maintain or obtain this insurance on acceptable terms or at all. Because we may not be able to obtain insurance that provides us with adequate protection against all potential product liability claims, a successful claim in excess of our insurance coverage could materially deplete our assets. Moreover, even if we are able to obtain adequate insurance, any claim against us could generate negative publicity, which could impair our reputation and adversely affect the demand for our products, our ability to generate sales and our profitability.\nSome of the agreements that we may enter into with manufacturers of our products and components of our products may require us\n\u25cf to obtain product liability insurance; or\n\u25cf to indemnify manufacturers against liabilities resulting from the sale of our products.\nFor example, the agreement with our contract manufacturer (\u201cCM\u201d) requires that we obtain and maintain certain minimum product liability insurance coverage and that we indemnify our CM against certain liabilities arising out of our products that they manufacture, provided they do not arise out of our CM\u2019s breach of the agreement, negligence or willful misconduct. If we are not able to obtain and maintain adequate product liability insurance, then we could be in breach of these agreements, which could materially adversely affect our ability to produce our products and generate revenues. Even if we are able to obtain and maintain product liability insurance, if a successful claim in excess of our insurance coverage is made, then we may have to indemnify some or all of our manufacturers for their losses, which could materially deplete our assets.\nWe face significant challenges in obtaining market acceptance of our products, which could adversely affect our potential sales and revenues.\nWe do not yet have an established market or customer base for our products. Acceptance of our products in the marketplace by both potential users, including chronic renal failure patients, and potential purchasers, including nephrologists, dialysis clinics and other health care providers, is uncertain, and our failure to achieve sufficient market acceptance will significantly limit our ability to generate revenue and be profitable. Market acceptance will require substantial marketing efforts and the expenditure of significant funds by us to inform dialysis patients and nephrologists, dialysis clinics and other health care providers of the benefits of using our products. We may encounter significant clinical and market resistance to our products and our products may never achieve market acceptance. We may not be able to build key relationships with physicians, clinical groups and government agencies, pursue or increase sales opportunities in Europe or elsewhere, or be the first to introduce HDF therapy in the United States. Product orders may be cancelled, patients or customers currently using our products may cease to do so and patients or customers expected to begin using our products may not. Factors that may affect our ability to achieve acceptance of our chronic renal failure therapy products in the marketplace include whether:\n\u25cf such products will be safe for use;\n\u25cf such products will be effective;\n\u25cf such products will be cost-effective;\n\u25cf we will be able to demonstrate product safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness;\n\u25cf there are unexpected side effects, complications or other safety issues associated with such products; and\n\u25cf government or third-party reimbursement for the cost of such products is available at reasonable rates, if at all.\nAcceptance of our water filtration products in the marketplace is also uncertain, and our failure to achieve sufficient market acceptance and sell such products at competitive prices will limit our ability to generate revenue and be profitable. Our water filtration products and technologies may not achieve expected reliability, performance and endurance standards. Our water filtration products and technologies may not achieve market acceptance, including among hospitals, or may not be deemed suitable for other commercial, military, industrial or retail applications.\nMany of the same factors that may affect our ability to achieve acceptance of our chronic renal failure therapy products in the marketplace will also apply to our water filtration products, except for those related to side effects, clinical trials and third-party reimbursement.\nIf we are not able to successfully scale-up production of our products, then our sales and revenues will suffer.\nIn order to commercialize our products, we need to be able to produce them in a cost-effective way on a large scale to meet commercial demand, while maintaining extremely high standards for quality and reliability. The extent to which we fail to successfully commercialize our products will limit our ability to be profitable.\nWe expect to rely on a limited number of independent manufacturers to produce our products. Our manufacturers\u2019 systems and procedures may not be adequate to support our operations and may not be able to achieve the rapid execution necessary to exploit the market for our products. Our manufacturers could experience manufacturing and control problems as they begin to scale-up our future manufacturing operations, if any, and we may not be able to scale-up manufacturing in a timely manner or at a commercially reasonable cost to enable production in sufficient quantities. If we experience any of these problems with respect to our manufacturers\u2019 initial or future scale-ups of manufacturing operations, then we may not be able to have our products manufactured and delivered in a timely manner. Our products are new and evolving, and our manufacturers may encounter unforeseen difficulties in manufacturing them in commercial quantities or at all.\nIf we cannot develop adequate distribution, customer service and technical support networks, then we may not be able to market and distribute our products effectively and/or customers may decide not to order our products. In either case, our sales and revenues will suffer.\nOur strategy requires us to distribute our products and provide a significant amount of customer service and maintenance and other technical service. To provide these services, we have begun, and will need to continue, to develop a network of distribution and a staff of employees and independent contractors in each of the areas in which we intend to operate. We cannot assure that we will be able to organize and manage this network on a cost-effective basis. If we cannot effectively organize and manage this network, then it may be difficult for us to distribute our products and to provide competitive service and support to our customers, in which case customers may be unable, or decide not, to order our products and our sales and revenues will suffer.\nWe have limited experience selling our products to healthcare facilities, and we might be unsuccessful in increasing our sales.\nOur business strategy depends in part on our ability to sell our products to hospitals and other healthcare facilities, including dialysis clinics. We have limited experience with respect to sales and marketing. If we are unsuccessful at manufacturing, marketing and selling our products, our operations and potential revenues will be materially adversely affected.\nWe cannot sell our products, including certain modifications thereto, until we obtain the requisite regulatory approvals and clearances in the countries in which we intend to sell our products. If we fail to receive, or experience a significant delay in receiving, such approvals and clearances, then we may not be able to get our products to market and enhance our revenues.\nOur business strategy depends in part on our ability to get our products into the market as quickly as possible. We have obtained a Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9ene (\u201cCE\u201d) mark, which demonstrates compliance with the relevant European Union requirements and is a regulatory prerequisite for selling our products in the European Union and certain other countries that recognize CE marking (collectively, \u201cEuropean Community\u201d), for our OLp\u016br MD 220 Hemodiafilter and our DSU. We have not yet obtained a CE mark for any of our other products. We previously received clearance from the FDA to market our OLp\u016br MD220 Hemodiafilter and OLp\u016br H2H Module for use with a hemodialysis machine that provides ultrapure dialysate in accordance with current ANSI/AAMI/ISO standards, for the treatment of chronic renal failure patients. We have not begun to broadly market these products and are actively seeking a commercialization partner in the United States.\nWe cannot ensure that any existing products that have not yet been approved, or any new products developed by us in the future, will be approved for marketing. The clearance and/or approval processes can be lengthy and uncertain, and each requires substantial commitments of our financial resources and our management\u2019s time and effort. We may not be able to obtain further CE marking or regulatory approval for any of our existing or new products in a timely manner or at all. Even if we do obtain regulatory approval, approval may be only for limited uses with specific classes of patients, processes or other devices. Our failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, the necessary regulatory clearance and/or approvals would prevent us from selling our affected products in the applicable regions. If we cannot sell some of our products in such regions, or if we are delayed in selling while waiting for the necessary clearance and/or approvals, our ability to generate revenues from these products will be limited.\nOver time, we intend to market our products globally. Requirements pertaining to the sale of our products vary widely from country to country. It may be very expensive and difficult for us to meet the requirements for the sale of our products in many countries. As a result, we may not be able to obtain the required approvals in a timely manner, if at all. If we cannot sell our products in a particular region, then the size of our potential market could be reduced, which would limit our potential sales and revenues.\nClinical studies that may be required for our products are costly and time-consuming, and their outcome is uncertain.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any of our products, other than those for which we have already received marketing approval in the United States and elsewhere, we must demonstrate through clinical studies that our products are safe and effective.\nFor products other than those for which we have already received marketing approval, if we do not prove in clinical trials that our products are safe and effective, we will not obtain marketing approvals from the applicable regulatory authorities. In particular, one or more of our products may not exhibit the expected medical benefits, may cause harmful side effects, may not be effective in treating dialysis patients, or may have other unexpected characteristics that preclude regulatory approval for any or all indications of use or limit commercial use if approved. The length of time necessary to complete clinical trials varies significantly and is difficult to predict. Factors that can cause delay or termination of our clinical trials include:\n\u25cf slower than expected patient enrollment due to the nature of the protocol, the proximity of subjects to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the study, competition with clinical trials for similar devices or other factors;\n\u25cf lower than expected retention rates of subjects in a clinical trial;\n\u25cf inadequately trained or insufficient personnel at the study site to assist in overseeing and monitoring clinical trials;\n\u25cf delays in approvals from a study site\u2019s review board, or other required approvals;\n\u25cf longer treatment time required to demonstrate effectiveness;\n\u25cf lack of sufficient supplies of the product;\n\u25cf adverse medical events or side effects in treated subjects; and\n\u25cf lack of effectiveness of the product being tested.\nEven if we obtain positive results from clinical studies for our products, we may not achieve the same success in future studies of such products. Data obtained from clinical studies is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. In addition, we may encounter delays or rejections based upon changes in regulatory policy for device approval during the period of product development and regulatory review of each submitted new device application. Moreover, regulatory approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses of the device. Failure to obtain requisite governmental approvals or failure to obtain approvals of the scope requested will delay or preclude our licensees or marketing partners from marketing our products or limit the commercial use of such products and will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, some or all of the clinical trials we undertake may not demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals, which could prevent or delay the creation of marketable products. Our product development costs will increase if we have delays in testing or approvals, if we need to perform more, larger or different clinical trials than planned or if our trials are not successful. Delays in our clinical trials may harm our financial results and the commercial prospects for our products. Additionally, we may be unable to complete our clinical trials if we are unable to obtain additional capital.\nWe may be required to design and conduct additional clinical trials.\nWe may be required to design and conduct additional clinical trials to further demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our products, which may result in significant expense and delay. Regulatory agencies may require new or additional clinical trials because of inconclusive results from current or earlier clinical trials, a possible failure to conduct clinical trials in complete adherence to certain regulatory standards, the identification of new clinical trial endpoints, or the need for additional data regarding the safety or efficacy of our products. Moreover, regulatory authorities may not ultimately approve our products for commercial sale in any jurisdiction, even if we believe future clinical results are positive.\nSignificant additional governmental regulation could subject us to unanticipated delays that would adversely affect our sales and revenues.\nOur business strategy depends in part on our ability to get our products into the market as quickly as possible. Additional laws and regulations, or changes to existing laws and regulations that are applicable to our business may be enacted or promulgated, and the interpretation, application or enforcement of the existing laws and regulations may change. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, applications or enforcements or the specific effects any of these might have on our business. Any future laws, regulations, interpretations, applications or enforcements could delay or prevent regulatory approval or clearance of our products and our ability to market our products. Moreover, changes that result in our failure to comply with the requirements of applicable laws and regulations could result in enforcement actions by the FDA and/or other agencies, all of which could impair our ability to have manufactured and to sell the affected products.\nProtecting our intellectual property in our technology through patents may be costly and ineffective. If we are not able to adequately secure or enforce protection of our intellectual property, then we may not be able to compete effectively and we may not be profitable.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to protect the intellectual property for our technology through patents. We will only be able to protect our products and methods from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that our products and methods are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. Our 12 granted U.S. patents will expire at various times from 2020 to 2027, assuming they are properly maintained.\nThe protection provided by our patents, and patent applications if issued, may not be broad enough to prevent competitors from introducing similar products into the market. Our patents, if challenged or if we attempt to enforce them, may not necessarily be upheld by the courts of any jurisdiction. Numerous publications may have been disclosed by, and numerous patents may have been issued to, our competitors and others relating to methods and devices for dialysis of which we are not aware and additional patents relating to methods and devices for dialysis may be issued to our competitors and others in the future. If any of those publications or patents conflict with our patent rights, or cover our products, then any or all of our patent applications could be rejected and any or all of our granted patents could be invalidated, either of which could materially adversely affect our competitive position.\nLitigation and other proceedings relating to patent matters, whether initiated by us or a third party, can be expensive and time-consuming, regardless of whether the outcome is favorable to us, and may require the diversion of substantial financial, managerial and other resources. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to cease any related development, product sales or commercialization activities. In addition, if patents that contain dominating or conflicting claims have been or are subsequently issued to others and the claims of these patents are ultimately determined to be valid, then we may be required to obtain licenses under patents of others in order to develop, manufacture, use, import and/or sell our products. We may not be able to obtain licenses under any of these patents on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we do not obtain these licenses, we could encounter delays in, or be prevented entirely from using, importing, developing, manufacturing, offering or selling any products or practicing any methods, or delivering any services requiring such licenses.\nIf we file for or obtain additional patents in foreign countries, we will be subject to laws and procedures that differ from those in the United States. Such differences could create additional uncertainty about the level and extent of our patent protection. Moreover, patent protection in foreign countries may be different from patent protection under U.S. laws and may not be as favorable to us. Many non-U.S. jurisdictions, for example, prohibit patent claims covering methods of medical treatment of humans, although this prohibition may not include devices used for such treatment.\nIf we are not able to secure and enforce protection of our trade secrets through enforcement of our confidentiality and non-competition agreements, then our competitors may gain access to our trade secrets, we may not be able to compete effectively, and we may not be profitable. Such protection may be costly and ineffective.\nWe attempt to protect our trade secrets, including the processes, concepts, ideas and documentation associated with our technologies, through the use of confidentiality agreements and non-competition agreements with our current employees and with other parties to whom we have divulged such trade secrets. If these employees or other parties breach our confidentiality agreements and non-competition agreements, or if these agreements are not sufficient to protect our technology or are found to be unenforceable, then our competitors could acquire and use information that we consider to be our trade secrets and we may not be able to compete effectively. Policing unauthorized use of our trade secrets is difficult and expensive and, in the event we further expand our operations, the laws of other countries may not adequately protect our trade secrets.\nIf we are not able to maintain sufficient quality controls, then the approval or clearance of our products by the European Union, the FDA or other relevant authorities could be withdrawn, delayed or denied and our sales and revenues will suffer.\nApproval or clearance of our products could be withdrawn, delayed or denied by the European Union, the FDA and the relevant authorities of other countries if our manufacturing facilities do not comply with their respective manufacturing requirements. The European Union imposes requirements on quality control systems of manufacturers, which are inspected and certified on a periodic basis and may be subject to additional unannounced inspections. Failure by our manufacturers to comply with these requirements could prevent us from marketing our products in the European Community. The FDA also imposes requirements through quality system requirements regulations, which include requirements for good manufacturing practices. Failure by our manufacturers to comply with these requirements could prevent us from obtaining FDA pre-clearance or approval of our products and from marketing such products in the United States. Although the manufacturing facilities and processes that we use to manufacture our OLp\u016br MD HDF filter series have been inspected and certified by a worldwide testing and certification agency (also referred to as a notified body) that performs conformity assessments to European Union requirements for medical devices, they have not been inspected by the FDA. A \u201cnotified body\u201d is a group accredited and monitored by governmental agencies that inspects manufacturing facilities and quality control systems at regular intervals and is authorized to carry out unannounced inspections. We cannot be sure that any of the facilities or processes we use will comply or continue to comply with their respective requirements on a timely basis or at all, which could delay or prevent our obtaining the approvals we need to market our products in the European Community and the United States.\nTo market our products in the European Community, the United States and other countries, where approved, manufacturers of such products must continue to comply or ensure compliance with the relevant manufacturing requirements. Although we cannot control the manufacturers of our products, we may need to expend time, resources and effort in product manufacturing and quality control to assist with their continued compliance with these requirements. If violations of applicable requirements are noted during periodic inspections of the manufacturing facilities of our manufacturers, then we may not be able to continue to market the products manufactured in such facilities and our revenues may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may face significant risks associated with international operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect to manufacture and to market our products globally. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25cf fluctuations in exchange rates of the U.S. dollar could adversely affect our results of operations;\n\u25cf we may face difficulties in enforcing and collecting accounts receivable under some countries\u2019 legal systems;\n\u25cf local regulations may restrict our ability to sell our products, have our products manufactured or conduct other operations;\n\u25cf political instability could disrupt our operations;\n\u25cf some governments and customers may have longer payment cycles, with resulting adverse effects on our cash flow; and\n\u25cf some countries could impose additional taxes or restrict the import of our products.\nAny one or more of these factors could increase our costs, reduce our revenues, or disrupt our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Common Stock\nOur common stock could be further diluted as a result of the issuance of additional shares of common stock, warrants or options.\nIn the past we have issued common stock and warrants in order to raise money. We have also issued stock options and restricted stock as compensation for services and incentive compensation for our employees, directors and consultants. We have shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of certain of these securities and may increase the shares reserved for these purposes in the future. Our issuance of additional common stock, options and warrants could affect the rights of our stockholders, could reduce the market price of our common stock, or could obligate us to issue additional shares of common stock.\nMarket sales of large amounts of our common stock, or the potential for those sales even if they do not actually occur, may have the effect of depressing the market price of our common stock, the supply of common stock available for resale could be increased which could stimulate trading activity and cause the market price of our common stock to drop, even if our business is doing well. Furthermore, the issuance of any additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock could be substantially dilutive to holders of our common stock if they do not invest in future offerings.\nThe prices at which shares of the common stock trade have been and will likely continue to be volatile.\nDuring the two years ended December 31, 2019, our common stock has traded at prices ranging from a high of $11.35 to a low of $3.42 per share. Due to the lack of an active trading market for our common stock, we expect the prices at which our common stock might trade to continue to be highly volatile. The expected volatile price of our stock will make it difficult for investors to predict the value of an investment in our common stock, to sell shares at a profit at any given time, or to plan purchases and sales in advance. A variety of other factors might also affect the market price of our common stock. These include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf achievement or rejection of regulatory approvals by our competitors or us;\n\u25cf publicity regarding actual or potential clinical or regulatory results relating to products under development by our competitors or us;\n\u25cf delays or failures in initiating, completing or analyzing clinical trials or the unsatisfactory design or results of these trials;\n\u25cf announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by our competitors or us;\n\u25cf developments concerning proprietary rights, including patents;\n\u25cf regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u25cf economic or other crises and other external factors;\n\u25cf period-to-period fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u25cf threatened or actual litigation;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; and\n\u25cf sales of our common stock.\nWe are not able to control many of these factors, and we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our financial results will not necessarily be indicative of our future performance.\nWe have never paid dividends and do not intend to pay cash dividends.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock and currently do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Consequently, any returns on an investment in our common stock in the foreseeable future will have to come from an increase in the value of the stock itself. As noted above, the lack of an active trading market for our common stock will make it difficult to value and sell our common stock. While our dividend policy will be based on the operating results and capital needs of our business, we anticipate that all earnings, if any, will be retained to finance our future operations.\nSeveral provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and our second amended and restated bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nSeveral provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and our second amended and restated bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, and the market price of our common stock could be reduced as a result. These provisions include:\n\u25cf authorizing our board of directors to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u25cf providing for a classified board of directors with staggered, three-year terms;\n\u25cf prohibiting us from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder unless certain provisions are met;\n\u25cf prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u25cf limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u25cf establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nAs a smaller reporting company with little or no name recognition and with several risks and uncertainties that could impair our business operations, we are not likely to generate widespread interest in our common stock. Without widespread interest in our common stock, our common stock price may be highly volatile and an investment in our common stock could decline in value.\nUnlike many companies with publicly traded securities, we have little or no name recognition in the investment community. We are a relatively new company and very few investors are familiar with either our company or our products. We do not have an active trading market in our common stock, and one might never develop, or if it does develop, might not continue.\nAdditionally, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, many of which are beyond our control. Risks and uncertainties, including those described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section could impair our business operations or otherwise cause our operating results or prospects to be below expectations of investors and market analysts, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As a result, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their purchase price and could lose all of their investment.\nSecurities class action litigation is often brought against public companies following periods of volatility in the market price of such company\u2019s securities. We may become subject to this type of litigation in the future. Litigation of this type could be extremely expensive and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from running our company.\nOur directors, executive officers and Lambda Investors LLC (\u201cLambda\u201d) control a significant portion of our stock and, if they choose to vote together, could have sufficient voting power to control the vote on substantially all corporate matters.\nAs of February 20, 2020, Lambda, our largest stockholder, beneficially owned approximately 39% of our outstanding common stock. Collectively, Lambda, our directors and our executive officers beneficially owned approximately 45% of our outstanding common stock. As a result of this ownership, Lambda has the ability to exert significant influence over our policies and affairs, including the election of directors. Lambda, whether acting alone or acting with other stockholders, could have the power to elect all of our directors and to control the vote on substantially all other corporate matters without the approval of other stockholders. Furthermore, such concentration of voting power could enable Lambda, whether acting alone or acting with other stockholders, to delay or prevent another party from taking control of our company even where such change of control transaction might be desirable to other stockholders. The interests of Lambda in any matter put before the stockholders may differ from those of any other stockholder.\nFuture sales of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline due to sales of a large number of shares in the market, including sales of shares by Lambda or any other large stockholder, or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales could also make it more difficult or impossible for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate to raise funds through future offerings of common stock. Future sales of our common stock by stockholders could depress the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 90341, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "NEPH"}
