Risk Factors\nIf we do not compete effectively, our business will suffer.\nWe confront aggressive competition in the sale of our products. In each of the markets in which we sell our products, we compete with a number of national and regional competitors. Competition in the automotive market is particularly intense, with many national and regional companies marketing competitive products. Many of our competitors in the automotive market are more established and have greater financial resources than we do. Moreover, we confront intense competition with respect to our Performacide\u00ae disinfectant, sanitizing and deodorizing products from a large number of competitors, many of which are well established and have substantially greater financial resources than we do. Our inability to successfully compete in our principal markets would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is, to a significant extent, dependent on a small number of major customers, and the loss of any of these customers could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nNet sales to our four largest unaffiliated customers accounted for 52.0% of our consolidated net sales in 2019; our largest unaffiliated customer accounted for 21.7% of our consolidated net sales in 2019. The loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer is a majority shareholder who controls us, and his interests may conflict with or differ from the Company\u2019s interests.\nPeter G. Dornau, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, together with a family entity he controls, owns approximately 50.7% of our common stock. As a result, Mr. Dornau has the power to elect all of our directors and effectively has the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of our Board of Directors and our shareholders. Products that we manufacture and that are sold outside of the United States and Canada are purchased from us and distributed by two companies owned by Mr. Dornau, which we refer to as the \u201caffiliated companies.\u201d The affiliated companies also collectively own the rights to the Star brite\u00ae and Star Tron\u00ae trademarks and related products outside of the United States and Canada. Sales to the affiliated companies aggregated approximately $1,788,000 and $2,190,000 during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition, we provided administrative services and advances for business related expenditures to the affiliated companies. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, fees for administrative services aggregated approximately $779,000 and $760,000, respectively, and amounts billed to the affiliated companies to reimburse the Company for business related expenditures made on behalf of the affiliated companies aggregated approximately $113,000 and $151,000, respectively. Receivables due from the affiliated companies in connection with product sales, administrative services, and advances for business related expenditures totaled approximately $962,000 and $1,046,000 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The accounts receivable turnover ratio for the year ended December 31, 2019 with respect to sales to the affiliated companies was approximately 3.4 and with respect to administrative services and advances for business related expenditures was approximately 1.9. Management believes that the sales and provision of administrative services to the affiliated companies do not involve more than normal credit risk.\nWe have entered into other transactions with entities owned by Mr. Dornau. See Notes 4 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information.\nEconomic conditions can adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to risks arising from adverse changes in general domestic and global economic conditions, including recession or economic slowdown and disruption of credit markets, which may impair the ability of our customers to satisfy obligations due to us. In addition, we believe that adverse economic conditions in recent years adversely constrained discretionary spending, which we believe has, at times, adversely affected our sales, particularly with respect to products directed to the marine and recreational vehicle markets. While published reports indicate that economic conditions, particularly in the United States, generally have improved over the past several years, a future decline in economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we do not effectively utilize or successfully assert intellectual property rights, our competitiveness could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on trademarks and trade names in connection with our products, the most significant of which are Star brite\u00ae and Star Tron\u00ae. In addition, we own patents we have viewed as providing some degree of competitive support for our Performacide\u00ae products. We rely on trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot assure that these intellectual property rights will be effectively utilized or, if necessary, successfully asserted. There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own intellectual property rights, or, where appropriate, license from others intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions. Our intellectual property rights, and any additional rights we may obtain in the future, may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged, and the legal costs necessary to protect our intellectual property rights could be significant. Our failure to perfect or successfully assert intellectual property rights could harm our competitive position and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business involves the use of chemicals.\nAt our Kinpak facility we blend various chemicals that can cause explosions or harmful gas to be released. Mishandling of chemicals can potentially result in people being hurt or killed, property damaged, and business interruption. On December 9, 2019, there was a chemical reaction incident at the Kinpak facility that resulted in three employees suffering injuries, which we do not believe to be serious. The chemical incident damaged various manufacturing equipment with a net book value of $50,520. The Company recorded a loss for the $50,520 and an offsetting insurance claim receivable of $50,520 in 2019.\nEnvironmental matters may cause potential liability risks.\nWe must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in connection with our operations, including those relating to the handling and disposal of hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances. A release of such substances due to accident or intentional act could result in substantial liability to governmental authorities or to third parties. In addition, we are subject to reporting requirements with respect to certain materials we use in our manufacturing operations. It is possible that we could become subject to environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected by public health epidemics, including the coronavirus reported to have originated in Wuhan, China.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus disease (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) was first reported in Wuhan, China. Less than four months later, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic-the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus. The outbreak has reached more than 160 countries, resulting in the implementation of significant governmental measures, including lockdowns, closures, quarantines and travel bans, intended to control the spread of the virus.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has already caused severe global disruptions. In response to the virus, various countries have implemented lockdown measures, and other countries and local governments may also do so. The United States and various states and municipalities have limited activities. Companies are also taking precautions, such as requiring employees to work remotely, imposing travel restrictions and temporarily closing businesses.\nA public health pandemic, such as that relating to COVID-19, poses the risk that we or our suppliers, customers and other business partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. In addition, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected to the extent an epidemic harms the global economy in general.\nThe extent of COVID-19\u2019s effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the outbreak, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict considering the rapidly evolving landscape. As a result, it is not currently possible to ascertain the overall impact of COVID-19 on our business. However, if the pandemic continues to evolve into a severe worldwide health crisis, the disease could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and adversely impact the trading price of our common stock.\nOur variable rate indebtedness exposes us to risks related to interest rate fluctuation and matures in August 2021.\nWe have a revolving line of credit with a variable interest rate. Interest on the revolving line of credit is payable at the one month LIBOR rate plus 1.35% per annum, computed on a 365/360 basis. At December 31, 2019, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the revolving line of credit. However, if we borrow amounts under the revolving line of credit in the future, and if interest rates were to increase significantly, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Moreover, we believe, but cannot assure, that we could obtain a renewal of the revolving line of credit or a suitable replacement facility when the current facility terminates in August 2021. Our failure to renew or obtain a replacement for our current facility may impair our financial flexibility and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWeather conditions can adversely affect our sales.\nOur sales can be adversely affected by prolonged cold winters which curtail boating activity and by natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods and tornados. During 2019 both the second and third quarters were adversely affected by weather conditions.\nTrading in our common stock has been limited, and our stock price could potentially be subject to substantial fluctuations.\nOur common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, but trading in our stock has been limited. Our stock price could be affected substantially by a relatively modest volume of transactions.", "PERMNO": 72611, "SIC": 2842, "TIC": "OBCI"}
