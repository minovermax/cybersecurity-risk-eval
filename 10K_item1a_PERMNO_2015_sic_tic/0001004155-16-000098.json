RISK FACTORS\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain expectations and projections regarding our future performance referenced in this section and elsewhere in this report, as well as in other reports and proxy statements we file with the SEC or otherwise release to the public and on our website are forward-looking statements and are subject to uncertainties and risks. Senior officers and other employees may also make verbal statements to analysts, investors, regulators, the media and others that are forward-looking.\nForward-looking statements often include words such as \"anticipate,\" \"assume,\" \"believe,\" \"can,\" \"could,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"forecast,\" \"future,\" \"goal,\" \"indicate,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"outlook,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"proposed,\" \"seek,\" \"should,\" \"target,\" \"would\" or similar expressions. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.\nWhile we believe that our expectations are reasonable in view of the information that we currently have, these expectations are subject to future events, risks and uncertainties, and there are numerous factors - many of which are beyond our control - that could cause actual results to vary materially from these expectations. Such events, risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ncertain risks and uncertainties associated with the proposed merger with Southern Company, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nthe possibility that the proposed merger does not close due to the failure to satisfy the closing conditions, including, but not limited to, a failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\ndelays caused by required regulatory approvals, which may delay the proposed merger or cause the companies to abandon the transaction;\n\u2022\ndisruption from the proposed merger making it more difficult to maintain our business and operational relationships and the risk that unexpected costs will be incurred during this process; and\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management time on merger-related issues;\n\u2022\nchanges in price, supply and demand for natural gas and related products;\n\u2022\nthe impact of changes in state and federal legislation and regulation, including any changes related to climate matters;\n\u2022\nactions taken by government agencies on rates and other matters;\n\u2022\nconcentration of credit risk;\n\u2022\nutility and energy industry consolidation;\n\u2022\nthe impact on cost and timeliness of construction projects by government and other approvals, project delays, adequacy of supply of diversified vendors, and unexpected changes in project costs, including the cost of funds to finance these projects and our ability to recover our project costs from our customers;\n\u2022\nlimits on pipeline capacity;\n\u2022\nthe impact of acquisitions and divestitures;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully integrate operations that we have or may acquire or develop in the future;\n\u2022\ndirect or indirect effects on our business, financial condition or liquidity resulting from a change in our credit ratings or the credit ratings of our counterparties or competitors;\n\u2022\ninterest rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nfinancial market conditions, including disruptions in the capital markets and lending environment;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\nuncertainties about environmental issues and the related impact of such issues, including our environmental remediation plans;\n\u2022\nthe capacity of our gas storage caverns, which are subject to natural settling and other occurrences;\n\u2022\ncontracting rates at our midstream operations storage business;\n\u2022\nthe impact of our construction projects and related capital expenditures, including our pipeline projects;\n\u2022\nthe development, timing and anticipated costs relating to our pipeline projects;\n\u2022\nthe impact of changes in weather on the temperature-sensitive portions of our business;\n\u2022\nthe impact of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, on the supply and price of natural gas;\n\u2022\nacts of war or terrorism;\n\u2022\nthe outcome of litigation;\n\u2022\nthe effect of accounting pronouncements issued periodically by standard-setting bodies; and\n\u2022\nthe other factors discussed elsewhere herein and in our other filings with the SEC.\nThere may also be other factors that we do not anticipate or that we do not recognize as material that could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of future events, new information or otherwise, except as required by law.\nGlossary\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business is subject to substantial regulation by federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Adverse determinations by them and, in some instances, the absence of timely determinations, could adversely affect our business.\nAt the federal level, our business is regulated by the FERC. At the state level, our business is regulated by public service commissions or similar authorities, as well as local governing bodies with respect to certain issues.\nDepending upon the jurisdiction, these regulatory authorities are generally entitled to review and approve many aspects of our operations, including the rates that we charge customers (including the recovery of costs for regulatory infrastructure replacement and other capital projects), the rates of return on our equity investments in our operating companies, how we operate our business, and the interaction between our regulated operating companies and other subsidiaries that might provide products or services to those companies. In addition, our operating companies are generally subject to franchise agreements that entitle them to provide products and services.\nWhile applicable law often provides a framework for the approvals that we need, the regulatory authorities generally have broad discretion. Moreover, in some jurisdictions, the regulatory process involves elected officials and is subject to inherent political issues, which can impact the approvals that we request. As a result, we may or may not be able to obtain the approvals that we request, the timing of obtaining those approvals can be uncertain, and the approvals can be subject to conditions that may or may not be favorable to our business. Should we not obtain the rate increases that we request in a timely manner, should we not fully recover the costs that we incur, or should we otherwise not obtain favorable approvals for the operation of our business, our business will be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, the regulatory environment in which we operate has increased in complexity over time, and further change is likely in many jurisdictions. These changes may or may not be favorable to our business. As the regulatory environment grows in complexity, inadvertent noncompliance is increasingly a greater risk. Noncompliance can, depending upon the circumstances, result in fines, penalties or other enforcement action by regulatory authorities, as well as damage our reputation and standing in the community, all of which would adversely impact our business.\nEnergy prices can fluctuate widely and quickly. To the extent that we have not anticipated and planned for those changes, our business can be adversely affected.\nThe price for natural gas and competing energy sources, such as oil, can fluctuate widely. Generally, we pass through changes in prices to our utility customers, and we have a process in place to continually review the adequacy of our utility gas rates and to take appropriate action with the applicable regulatory authorities. However, there is an inherent regulatory lag in adjusting rates and, in an increasing price environment, we have to bear the increased costs on an interim basis, which results in additional financing costs as a result of purchasing more expensive natural gas.\nIn addition, increases in natural gas prices, both in absolute terms and relative to alternative energy sources, negatively impacts demand, the ability of customers to pay their utility bills and the timing of those payments (which lead to larger accounts receivable and greater bad debt expense) and various other factors. While the impact of some of these factors can be passed through to customers, there is generally a delay in that process that can adversely affect our business.\nAs noted below, for some portions of our business, we hedge the risk of price changes through the purchase of futures contracts and other means. These efforts, while designed to minimize the adverse impact of price changes, cannot assure the desired result. As a result, we retain exposure to price changes that can, in a volatile energy market, be extremely material and can adversely affect our business.\nVariations in weather beyond what we have planned for can adversely impact our business.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from the transportation or sale of natural gas for heating purposes. We plan for the demand of gas for this purpose based upon historical weather patterns and resulting demand. Where weather varies significantly beyond the range that we have planned for, it can impact us in many ways, including through increasing or decreasing the demand for natural gas, the cost of natural gas to us, and the availability, sufficiency and cost of transportation and storage capacity.\nA decrease in the availability of adequate pipeline transportation capacity due to weather conditions or otherwise could adversely impact our business. We depend upon having access to adequate transportation and storage capacity for virtually all of our operations. A decrease in interstate pipeline capacity available to us, or an increase in competition for interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity (e.g., even as a result of weather in regions that we do not significantly serve) could reduce our normal interstate supply of natural gas or cause rates to fluctuate.\nWe have WNA mechanisms for Virginia Natural Gas, Elizabethtown Gas and Chattanooga Gas that partially offset the impact of unusually cold or warm weather on residential and/or commercial customer billings and on our operating margin, although at Elizabethtown Gas, we could be required to return a portion of any WNA surcharge to its customers if Elizabethtown Gas\u2019 return on equity exceeds its authorized return on equity. These WNA regulatory mechanisms are most effective in a reasonable temperature range relative to normal weather using historical averages. Outside of those ranges, our financial exposure is greater.\nGlossary\nWe also have decoupled rate designs, including straight-fixed-variable, at Atlanta Gas Light, Virginia Natural Gas and Chattanooga Gas that allow for the recovery of fixed customer service costs separately from assumed natural gas volumes used by our customers. For more information, see Item 1, \u201cBusiness\u201d under the caption \u201cRate Structures\u201d herein.\nAt Nicor Gas, approximately 55% of all usage is for heating and approximately 73% of the usage and revenues occur from October through March. Weather fluctuations have the potential to significantly impact operating income and cash flow. For example, we estimate that a 100 degree-day variation from normal weather of 5,845 Heating Degree Days impacts Nicor Gas\u2019 margin, net of income taxes, by approximately $1 million under its current rate structure. For our weather risk associated with Nicor Gas, we utilize weather derivatives to reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of lower operating margins potentially resulting from significantly warmer-than-normal weather in Illinois. For more information, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein.\nChanges in weather conditions may also impact SouthStar\u2019s earnings. As a result, SouthStar uses a variety of weather derivative instruments to mitigate the impact on its operating margin in the event of warmer or colder-than-normal weather in the winter months. However, these instruments do not fully mitigate the effects of unusually warm or cold weather.\nSimilarly, changes in weather conditions may also impact wholesale services\u2019 earnings. In addition to the impacts described above, weather impacts the ability of our wholesale services segment to capture value from location and seasonal spreads. Through the acquisition of natural gas and hedging of natural gas prices, wholesale services reduces some of the weather-related risks that it faces, but it cannot eliminate all of those risks.\nSouthStar offers utility-bill management products that mitigate and/or eliminate the risks of variations in weather to customers. We hedge this risk to reduce any adverse effects to us from weather variations.\nWe are subject to environmental regulation and our costs to comply are significant. Any changes in existing environmental regulation could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of federal, state and municipal laws and regulations. Such environmental regulation imposes, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations associated with storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of MGP residuals and waste in connection with spills, releases and emissions of various substances into the environment. Environmental legislation also requires that our facilities, sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. Our current costs to comply with these laws and regulations are significant. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations and failure to obtain any required permits and licenses may expose us to material fines, penalties or operational interruptions.\nWe are generally responsible for liabilities associated with the environmental condition of the natural gas assets that we have operated, acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are or were known or unknown. In addition, in connection with certain acquisitions and sales of assets, we may obtain, or be required to provide, indemnification against certain environmental liabilities. Before natural gas was widely available, we manufactured gas from coal and other fuels. Those manufacturing operations were known as MGPs, which we ceased operating in the 1950s. A number of environmental issues may exist with respect to MGP\u2019s. For more information regarding these obligations, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein. Claims against us under environmental laws and regulations could result in material costs and liabilities.\nExisting environmental laws and regulations could also be revised or reinterpreted, and new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities. With the trend toward stricter standards, greater regulation, more extensive permit requirements and an increase in the number and types of assets operated by us subject to environmental regulation, our environmental expenditures could increase in the future, and such expenditures may not be fully recoverable from our customers. Additionally, the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions could give rise to expenditures and liabilities, including fines or penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur infrastructure improvement and customer growth may be restricted by the capital-intensive nature of our business.\nWe must construct additions and replacements to our natural gas distribution systems to continue the expansion of our customer base and improve system reliability, especially during peak usage. We may also need to construct expansions of our existing natural gas storage facilities or develop and construct new natural gas storage facilities. The cost of such construction may be affected by the cost of obtaining government and other approvals, project delays, adequacy of supply of vendors, vendor performance, or unexpected changes in project costs. Weather, general economic conditions and the cost of funds to finance our capital projects can materially alter the cost, the projected construction schedule and the completion timeline of a project. Our cash flows may not be fully adequate to finance the cost of such construction. As a result, we may be required to fund a portion of our cash needs through additional debt borrowings. For our distribution operations segment, this may limit our ability to expand our infrastructure to connect new customers due to limits on the amount we can economically invest, which shifts costs to potential customers and may make it uneconomical for them to connect to our distribution systems. For our natural gas storage business, this may significantly reduce our earnings and return on investment from what would be expected for this business, or it may impair our ability to complete the expansions or development projects.\nGlossary\nWe may be exposed to regulatory and financial risks related to the impact of climate change legislation and regulation.\nClimate change legislation is receiving increased attention from the current federal administration, non-governmental organizations and legislators. Debate continues as to the extent to which our climate is changing, the potential causes of any change and its potential impacts. Some attribute climate change to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Below is a summary of recent global and federal actions related to climate change legislation.\nIn December 2015, the U.S. and 195 other nations adopted the United Nations sponsored Paris Agreement on global climate change (Paris Agreement), which establishes a universal framework for addressing greenhouse gas emissions based on nationally determined contributions. It also sets in place a process for increasing those commitments every five years. The ultimate impact of the Paris Agreement depends on its ratification and implementation by participating countries, and cannot be determined at this time.\nThe EPA has begun using provisions of the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane, differently than under historical precedent. Thus far, the EPA has imposed greenhouse gas regulations on automobiles and implemented new permitting requirements for the construction or modification of major stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions, including natural gas-fired power plants.\nIn addition, President Obama issued a Presidential Memorandum on June 25, 2013, directing the EPA to adopt performance standards to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. Specifically, the Presidential Memorandum directed the EPA to propose standards for future power plants by September 20, 2013 and propose regulations and emission guidelines for modified, reconstructed, and existing power plants by June 1, 2014. The Presidential Memorandum directed the EPA to finalize those regulations by June 1, 2015. The EPA complied and issued the commonly referred to Clean Power Plan, which seeks to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing electric utility generating units by 30% from 2005 levels and promotes increased use of natural gas and renewable energy. States are required to develop regulations implementing the EPA\u2019s guidelines by September 6, 2016 and may seek a two-year extension. It also includes a wide variety of other initiatives designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lead international efforts to address climate change.\nThe outcome of global, federal and state climate change legislation could potentially result in new regulations, additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities or other regulatory actions, which in turn could:\n\u2022\nresult in increased costs associated with our operations,\n\u2022\nincrease other costs to our business,\n\u2022\naffect the demand for natural gas (positively or negatively), and\n\u2022\nimpact the prices we charge our customers and affect the competitive position of natural gas.\nBecause natural gas is a fossil fuel with low carbon content relative to other traditional fuels, future carbon constraints may create additional demand for natural gas, both for production of electricity and direct use in homes and businesses. The impact is already being seen in the power production sector due to both environmental regulations and low natural gas costs. Future regulation of methane, a greenhouse gas and primary constituent of natural gas, could likewise result in increased costs to us and affect the demand for natural gas, as well as the prices we charge our customers and the competitive position of natural gas.\nAny adoption of regulation by federal or state governments mandating a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions could have far-reaching and significant impacts on the energy industry. We cannot predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations on our business.\nTransporting and storing natural gas involves risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\nOur gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, explosions and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury to employees and non-employees, loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution and impairment of our operations, which in turn could lead to substantial losses to us. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. We also rely on natural gas pipelines and other storage and transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver natural gas to wholesale markets and to our distribution systems.\nWe face increasing competition, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our revenues, operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected, which may limit our ability to grow our business.\nThe natural gas business is highly competitive, increasingly complex, and we are facing increasing competition from other companies that supply energy, including electric, oil and propane providers and, in some cases, energy marketing and trading companies. In particular, the success of our retail businesses is affected by competition from other energy marketers providing retail natural gas services in our service territories, most notably in Illinois and Georgia. Natural gas competes with other forms of energy. The primary competitive factor is price. Changes in the price or availability of natural gas relative to other forms of energy and the ability of end users to convert to alternative fuels affect the demand for natural gas. In the case of commercial, industrial and agricultural customers, adverse economic conditions, including higher natural gas costs, could also cause these customers to bypass or disconnect from our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower per-unit costs.\nGlossary\nOur retail operations segment markets fixed-price and fixed-bill contracts that protect customers against higher natural gas prices, or protect customers against both higher natural gas prices and colder weather. The sale of these fixed-price contracts may be adversely affected if natural gas prices are, or are perceived to be, low and stable. Our retail operations segment also faces risks in the form of price, convenience and service competition from other warranty companies.\nOur wholesale services segment competes for sales with national and regional full-service energy providers, energy merchants and producers, and pipelines based on our ability to aggregate competitively-priced commodities with transportation and storage capacity. Some of our competitors are larger and better capitalized than we are and have more national and global exposure than we do. The consolidation of this industry and the pricing to gain market share may affect our operating margin. We expect this trend to continue in the near term, and the competition for asset management deals could result in downward pressure on the volume of transactions and the related operating margin available in this portion of Sequent\u2019s business.\nOur midstream operations segment competes with natural gas facilities in the Gulf Coast region of the U.S., as the majority of the existing and proposed high deliverability salt-dome natural gas storage facilities in North America are located in the Gulf Coast region. Competition for our Central Valley storage facility in northern California primarily consists of storage facilities in northern California and western North America. Storage values have declined over the past several years due to low natural gas prices and low volatility, and we expect this to continue in 2016.\nA significant portion of our accounts receivable is subject to collection risks, due in part to a concentration of credit risk at Nicor Gas, Atlanta Gas Light, SouthStar and Sequent.\nNicor Gas and Sequent often extend credit to counterparties. Despite performing credit analyses prior to extending credit and seeking to implement netting agreements, if the counterparties fail to perform and any collateral Nicor Gas or Sequent has secured is inadequate, we could experience material financial losses. Further, Sequent has a concentration of credit risk with a limited number of parties. Most of this concentration is with counterparties that are either load-serving utilities or end-use customers that have supplied some level of credit support. Default by any of these counterparties in their obligations to pay amounts due to Sequent could result in significant credit losses.\nWe have accounts receivable collection risks in Georgia due to a concentration of credit risks related to the provision of natural gas services to approximately 14 Marketers. As a result, Atlanta Gas Light depends on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of its revenues.\nAdditionally, SouthStar markets directly to end-use customers and has periodically experienced credit losses as a result of severe cold weather or high prices for natural gas that increase customers\u2019 bills and, consequently, impair customers\u2019 ability to pay. For more information, see Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d under the caption \u201cCredit Risk\u201d herein.\nThe asset management arrangements between Sequent and our local distribution utilities, and between Sequent and its non-affiliated customers, may not be renewed or may be renewed at lower levels, which could have a significant impact on Sequent\u2019s business.\nSequent currently manages the storage and transportation assets of our affiliates Atlanta Gas Light, Virginia Natural Gas, Elizabethtown Gas, Florida City Gas, Chattanooga Gas and Elkton Gas. The profits it earns from the management of those assets with these affiliates are shared with their respective customers and for Atlanta Gas Light with the Georgia Commission\u2019s Universal Service Fund, with the exception of Chattanooga Gas and Elkton Gas where Sequent is assessed annual fixed-fees. Entry into and renewal of these agreements are subject to regulatory approval, and we cannot predict whether such agreements will be renewed or the terms of such renewal.\nSequent also has asset management agreements with certain non-affiliated customers. Sequent\u2019s results could be significantly impacted if these agreements are not renewed or are amended or renewed with less favorable terms. Sustained low natural gas prices could reduce the demand for these types of asset management arrangements.\nWe are exposed to market risk and may incur losses in wholesale services, midstream operations and retail operations.\nThe commodity, storage and transportation portfolios at wholesale services and the commodity and storage portfolios at midstream operations and retail operations consist of contracts to buy and sell natural gas commodities, including contracts that are settled by the delivery of the commodity or cash. If the values of these contracts change in a direction or manner that we do not anticipate, we could experience financial losses from our trading activities. For more information, see Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d under the caption \u201cWeather and Natural Gas Price Risks - VaR\u201d herein.\nOur accounting results may not be indicative of the risks we are taking or the economic results we expect in our nonregulated businesses.\nAlthough we enter into various contracts to hedge the value of our energy assets and operations, the timing of the recognition of profits or losses in our financial results of our hedges does not always correspond to the economic results of the item being hedged. The difference in accounting can result in volatility in our reported results, even though the expected operating margin is essentially unchanged from the date the transactions were initiated.\nGlossary\nThe cost of providing retirement plan benefits to eligible current and former employees is subject to changes in the performance of investments, demographics, and various other factors and assumptions. These changes may have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe cost of providing retirement plan benefits to eligible current and former employees is subject to changes in the market value of our pension plan assets, changing demographics and assumptions, including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries and changes in health care cost trends. Any sustained declines in equity markets and reductions in bond yields will have an adverse effect on the value of our pension plan assets. In these circumstances, we may be required to recognize an increased pension expense and a charge to our other comprehensive income to the extent that the actual return on assets in the pension plan is less than the expected return. We may be required to make additional contributions in future periods in order to preserve the current level of benefits under the plans and in accordance with federal funding requirements.\nFor more information, see Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d under the caption \u201cContractual Obligations and Commitments\u201d and the subheading \u201cPension and Welfare Obligations\u201d and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein.\nNatural disasters, terrorist activities, human error and similarly unpredictable events could adversely affect our businesses.\nNatural disasters may damage our assets, interrupt our business operations and adversely impact the demand for natural gas. Future acts of terrorism could be directed against companies operating in the U.S., and companies in the energy industry may face a heightened risk of exposure. The insurance industry has been disrupted by these types of events. As a result, the availability of insurance covering risks against which we and similar businesses typically insure may be limited or insufficient. In addition, the insurance we are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums and more restrictive policy terms. In addition, an employee or third party may purposely, or inadvertently, fail to adhere to our policies and procedures or our policies and procedures may not be effective; this could result in the violation of a law or regulation, a material error or misstatement, damage to our reputation or the incurrence of substantial expense.\nWork stoppages could adversely impact our businesses.\nSome of our businesses are dependent upon employees who are represented by unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements may increase our costs, affect our ability to continue offering market-based salaries and benefits, and limit our ability to implement efficiency-related improvements. Disputes with the unions could result in work stoppages that could impact the delivery of natural gas and other services, which could strain relationships with customers, vendors and regulators. We believe that we have a good working relationship with our unionized employees and we remain committed to work in good faith with the unions to renew or renegotiate collective bargaining agreements that balance the needs of the company and our employees. For more information, see Item 1, \u201cBusiness\u201d under the caption \u201cEmployees\u201d herein.\nChanges in laws and regulations regarding the sale and marketing of products and services offered by our retail operations segment could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur retail operations segment provides various energy-related products and services. These include sales of natural gas and utility-bill management services to residential and small commercial customers, and the sale, repair, maintenance and warranty of heating, air conditioning and indoor air quality equipment. The sale and marketing of these products and services are subject to various state and federal laws and regulations. Changes in these laws and regulations could impose additional costs on, restrict or prohibit certain activities, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nConservation could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nAs a result of legislative and regulatory initiatives on energy conservation, we have put into place programs to promote additional energy efficiency by our customers. Funding for such programs is being recovered through cost recovery riders. However, the adverse impact of lower deliveries and resulting reduced margin could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nA security breach could disrupt our operating systems, shutdown our facilities or expose confidential information.\nSecurity breaches of our information technology infrastructure, including cyber-attacks, could lead to system disruptions or generate facility shutdowns. If a cyber-attack or security breach were to occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a cyber-attack could affect our ability to service our indebtedness, our ability to raise capital and our future growth opportunities.\nAdditionally, the protection of customer, employee and company data is critical to us. A breakdown or a breach in our systems that results in the unauthorized release of individually identifiable customer or other sensitive data could occur and could expose us to liability to our customers, vendors, financial institutions and others. In addition, a breakdown or breach could also materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such risks. There is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, although, to our knowledge, we had no material security breaches in 2015.\nGlossary\nWe may pursue acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions, which may impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe have pursued acquisitions to complement or expand our business, divestures and other strategic transactions in the past and expect to in the future. If we identify an acquisition candidate, we may not be able to successfully negotiate or finance the acquisition or integrate the acquired businesses with our existing business and services. Acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, amortization expenses and substantial goodwill. Acquisitions may not be accretive to our earnings and may cause dilution to our earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of our common shares. Any failure to successfully integrate businesses that we acquire in an efficient and effective manner could have a material adverse effect on us. Similarly, we may divest portions of our business, which may also have material and adverse effects.\nFuture impairments of goodwill or long-lived assets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe assess goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We assess our long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that an asset\u2019s carrying amount may not be recoverable. To the extent the value of goodwill or long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to incur impairment charges that could have a material impact on our results of operations. In the third quarter of 2015, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $14 million ($9 million, net of tax) of goodwill in our midstream operations segment. No impairment of goodwill was recorded as a result of our 2015 annual impairment testing for any of our other segments, as the fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of the carrying value. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein for additional information on impairment of assets. Additionally, no impairment of long-lived assets was recorded during 2015.\nSince interest rates are a key component, among other assumptions, in the models used to estimate the fair values of our reporting units, as interest rates rise, the calculated fair values decrease and future impairments may occur. Due to the subjectivity of the assumptions and estimates underlying the impairment analysis, future analyses may result in impairment.\nThese assumptions and estimates include projected cash flows, current and future rates for contracted capacity, growth rates, WACC and market multiples. For additional information, see Item 7,\u201dManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d under the caption \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d herein.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate and Financial Structure\nWe depend on access to the capital and financial markets to fund our business. Any inability to access these markets may limit our ability to execute our business plan or pursue improvements that we may rely on for future growth.\nWe rely on access to both short-term money markets (in the form of commercial paper and lines of credit) and long-term capital markets as sources of liquidity for capital and operating requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from our operations. If we are not able to access financial markets at competitive rates, our ability to implement our business plan and strategy will be negatively affected, and we may be forced to postpone, modify or cancel capital projects. Certain market disruptions may increase our cost of borrowing or affect our ability to access one or more financial markets and could result from:\n\u2022\nadverse economic conditions;\n\u2022\nadverse general capital market conditions;\n\u2022\npoor performance and health of the utility industry in general;\n\u2022\nbankruptcy or financial distress of unrelated energy companies or marketers;\n\u2022\nsignificant decrease in the demand for natural gas;\n\u2022\nadverse regulatory actions that affect our local gas distribution companies and our natural gas storage business;\n\u2022\nterrorist attacks on our facilities or our suppliers; or\n\u2022\nextreme weather conditions.\nThe amount of our working capital requirements in the near term will primarily depend on the market price of natural gas and weather. Higher natural gas prices may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our operations.\nWhile we believe we can meet our capital requirements from our operations and our available sources of financing, we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future, especially if the market price of natural gas increases significantly in the near term. The future effects on our business, liquidity and financial results due to market disruptions could be material and adverse to us, both in the ways described above or in ways that we do not currently anticipate.\nA downgrade in our credit rating would require us to pay higher interest rates and could negatively affect our ability to access capital, or may require us to provide additional collateral to certain counterparties.\nOur senior debt is currently assigned investment grade credit ratings. If the rating agencies downgrade our ratings, particularly below investment grade, it may significantly limit our access to the commercial paper market and our borrowing costs would increase. In addition, we would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and our potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease.\nGlossary\nAdditionally, if our credit rating by either S&P or Moody\u2019s falls to non-investment grade status, we would be required to provide additional collateral to continue conducting business with certain customers. For additional credit rating and interest rate information, see Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d under the caption \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d and Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,\u201d under the caption \u201cInterest Rate Risk\u201d herein.\nWe are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt and related interest rate swaps, which could lead to changes in interest expense and adversely affect our earnings.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk with the issuance of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. In order to maintain our desired mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, we may use interest rate swap agreements and exchange fixed-rate and variable-rate interest payment obligations over the life of the arrangements, without exchange of the underlying principal amounts. For additional information, see Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,\u201d under the caption \u201cInterest Rate Risk\u201d herein. However, we may not structure these swap agreements in a manner that manages our risks effectively. If we are unable to do so, our earnings may be reduced. In addition, higher interest rates, all other things equal, reduce the earnings that we derive from transactions where we capture the difference between authorized returns and short-term borrowings.\nWe are a holding company and are dependent on cash flow from our subsidiaries, which may not be available in the amounts and at the times we need.\nA significant portion of our outstanding debt was issued by our wholly owned subsidiary, AGL Capital, which we fully and unconditionally guarantee. Since we are a holding company and have no operations separate from our investment in our subsidiaries, we are dependent on the net income and cash flows of our subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream dividends or other distributions to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends and make other distributions is subject to applicable state law and regulatory restriction. In addition, Nicor Gas is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates.\nThe use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business could result in financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe use derivative instruments, including futures, options, forwards and swaps, to manage our commodity and financial market risks. We could recognize financial losses on these contracts as a result of volatility in the market values of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract. In addition, derivative contracts entered into for hedging purposes may not offset the underlying exposure being hedged as expected, resulting in financial losses. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these derivative instruments can involve management\u2019s judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could adversely affect the reported fair values of these contracts.\nAs a result of cross-default provisions in our borrowing arrangements, we may be unable to satisfy all of our outstanding obligations in the event of a default on our part.\nOur credit facilities contain cross-default provisions. Should an event of default occur under some of our debt agreements, we face the prospect of being in default under our other debt agreements, obligated in such instance to satisfy a large portion of our outstanding indebtedness and unable to satisfy all of our outstanding obligations simultaneously.\nRisk Factors Related to the Merger Agreement\nThe merger is subject to receipt of consent or approval from various governmental entities that could delay or prevent the completion of the merger or, in order to receive such consent or approval, the governmental entities may impose restrictions or conditions that could have a material adverse effect on the combined company or that could cause abandonment of the transaction.\nCompletion of the merger is contingent upon, among other things, satisfaction or waiver of specified closing conditions, including (i) the receipt of required regulatory approvals from the Federal Communications Commission, California Public Utilities Commission, Georgia Commission, Illinois Commission, Maryland Commission, New Jersey BPU and Virginia Commission, and such approvals having become final orders and (ii) the absence of a judgment, order, decision, injunction, ruling or other finding or agency requirement of a governmental entity prohibiting the consummation of the merger. For more information, see Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d under the caption \u201cExecutive Summary\u201d and the subheading \u201cProposed Merger With Southern Company\u201d and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein.\nWe may not receive the required statutory approvals and other clearances for the merger, or we may not receive them in a timely manner. If such approvals and clearances are received, they may impose terms, conditions or restrictions (i) that cause a failure of the closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, which could permit us or Southern Company to terminate the Merger Agreement and abandon the transaction or (ii) that could reasonably be expected to have a detrimental impact on the combined company following completion of the merger. A substantial delay in obtaining the required authorizations, approvals or consents or the imposition of unfavorable terms, conditions or restrictions contained in such authorizations, approvals or consents could prevent the completion of the merger or have an adverse effect on the anticipated benefits of the merger, thereby impacting the business, financial condition or results of operations of the combined company.\nNotwithstanding the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, governmental authorities could seek to block or challenge the merger as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest.\nGlossary\nFailure to complete the merger could adversely affect our stock price, future business operations and financial results.\nCompletion of the merger is subject to risks, including the risks that approval of the transaction by governmental agencies will not be obtained or that certain other closing conditions will not be satisfied. If we are unable to complete the merger, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe will have paid certain significant transaction costs, including legal, financial advisory and filing, printing and mailing fees, and in certain circumstances, a termination fee to Southern Company of $201 million;\n\u2022\nthe attention of our management may have been diverted to the merger rather than to our operations and the pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key personnel during the pendency of the merger as employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company;\n\u2022\nwe will have been subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business, which may prevent us from making certain acquisitions or dispositions or pursuing certain business opportunities while the merger is pending; and\n\u2022\nthe trading price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed.\nA failure to complete the merger may also result in negative publicity, additional litigation against the company or its directors and officers, and a negative impression of the company in the investment community. The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to contractual restrictions in the Merger Agreement that may hinder operations pending the merger.\nThe Merger Agreement restricts the Company, without Southern Company's consent, from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions until the merger occurs or the Merger Agreement terminates. For instance, the Company is limited in the amount of indebtedness for borrowed money it may incur and additional common shares that it may issue. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other changes to our business prior to completion of the merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.\nWe will be subject to various uncertainties while the merger is pending that may cause disruption and may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, suppliers or customers.\nUncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees, suppliers and customers may have an adverse effect on us. Although we intend to take steps designed to reduce any adverse effects, these uncertainties may impair our abilities to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause customers, suppliers and others that deal with us to seek to change or terminate existing business relationships with us or not enter into new relationships or transactions.\nEmployee retention and recruitment may be particularly challenging prior to the completion of the merger, as employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. If, despite our retention and recruiting efforts, key employees depart or fail to continue employment with us because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company, our financial results could be adversely affected. Furthermore, the combined company\u2019s operational and financial performance following the merger could be adversely affected if it is unable to retain key employees and skilled workers. The loss of the services of key employees and skilled workers and their experience and knowledge regarding our business could adversely affect the combined company\u2019s future operating results and the successful ongoing operation of its businesses.\nGlossary", "PERMNO": 15553, "SIC": 4924, "TIC": "SO7"}
