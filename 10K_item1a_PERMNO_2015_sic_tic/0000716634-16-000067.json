{"cik": "716634", "company": "READING INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-04-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nInvesting in our securities involves risk. Set forth below is a summary of various risk factors that you should consider in connection with your investment in the Company. This summary should be considered in the context of our overall Annual Report on Form 10K, as many of the topics addressed below are discussed in significantly greater detail in the context of specific discussions of our business plan, our operating results, and the various competitive forces that we face.\nBUSINESS RISK FACTORS\nWe are currently engaged principally in the cinema exhibition and real estate businesses. Because we operate in two business segments (cinema exhibition and real estate), we discuss separately below the risks we believe to be material to our involvement in each of these segments. We have discussed separately certain risks relating to the international nature of our business activities, our use of leverage, and our status as a controlled corporation. Please note that, while we report the results of our live theater operations as real estate operations - because we are principally in the business of renting space to producers rather than in licensing or producing plays ourselves - the cinema exhibition and live theater businesses share certain risk factors and are, accordingly, discussed together below.\nCinema Exhibition and Live Theater Business Risk Factors\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment with many competitors who are significantly larger and may have significantly better access to funds than we do.\nWe are a comparatively small cinema operator and face competition from much larger cinema exhibitors. These larger exhibitors are able to offer distributors more screens in more markets - including markets where they may be the exclusive exhibitor - than can we. Faced with such competition, we may not be able to get access to all of the films we want, which may adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nThese larger competitors may also enjoy (i) greater cash flow, which can be used to develop additional cinemas, including cinemas that may be competitive with our existing cinemas, (ii) better access to equity capital and debt, (iii) better visibility to landlords and real estate developers; and (iv) better economies of scale, than we do.\nIn the case of our live theaters, we compete for shows not only with other \u201cfor profit\u201d Off-Broadway theaters, but also with \u201cnot-for-profit\u201d operators and, increasingly, with Broadway theaters. We believe our live theaters are generally competitive with other Off-Broadway venues. However, due to the increased cost of staging live theater productions, we are seeing an increasing tendency for plays that would historically have been staged in an Off-Broadway theater moving directly to larger Broadway venues.\nWe face competition from other sources of entertainment and other entertainment delivery systems.\nBoth our cinema and live theater operations face competition from \u201cin-home\u201d and mobile device sources of entertainment. These include competition from network, cable and satellite television, internet streaming video services, Video on Demand, Blu-ray/DVD,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nthe internet, video games and other sources of entertainment. The quality of in-house entertainment systems, as well as programming available on an in-home and mobile basis, has increased, while the cost to consumers of such systems (and such programming) has decreased in recent periods, and some consumers may prefer the security and/or convenience of an \u201din-home\u201d or mobile entertainment experience to the more public and presentation oriented experience offered by our cinemas and live theaters. Film distributors have been responding to these developments by, in some cases, decreasing or eliminating the period of time between cinema release and the date such product is made available to \u201cin-home\u201d forms of distribution.\nThe narrowing and/or elimination of this so-called \u201cwindow\u201d for cinema exhibition may be problematic for the cinema exhibition industry. However, to date, attempts by the major film distributors to continue to narrow or eliminate the window have been strenuously resisted by the cinema exhibition industry, and we view the total elimination of the cinema exhibition window by major film distributors, while theoretically possible, to be unlikely.\nHowever, there is the risk that, over time, distributors may move towards simultaneous release of motion picture product in multiple channels of distribution. Also, some traditional in-home and mobile distributors have begun the production of full-length movies, specifically for the purpose of direct or simultaneous release to the in-home and mobile markets. These factors may adversely affect the competitive advantage enjoyed by cinemas over \u201cin-home\u201d and mobile forms of entertainment, as it may be that the cinema market and the \u201cin-home\u201d and mobile markets will have simultaneous access to the same motion picture product. In recent times a number of movies were released on a simultaneous basis to movie exhibitors and to in-home and mobile markets. It is likely that this trend will continue, making it increasingly important for exhibitors to enhance the convenience and quality of the theater-going experience.\nWe also face competition from various other forms of \u201cbeyond-the-home\u201d entertainment, including sporting events, concerts, restaurants, casinos, video game arcades, and nightclubs. Our cinemas also face competition from live theaters and vice versa.\nOur cinema and live theater businesses may be vulnerable to fears of terrorism, other natural disasters which could cause customers to avoid public assembly seating\nPolitical events, such as terrorist attacks, and health-related epidemics, such as flu outbreaks, could cause patrons to avoid our cinemas or other public places where large crowds are in attendance. In addition, a natural disaster, such as a typhoon or an earthquake, could impact our ability to operate certain of our cinemas, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur cinema operations depend upon access to film that is attractive to our patrons, and our live theater operations depend upon the continued attractiveness of our theaters to producers.\nOur ability to generate revenue and profits is largely dependent on factors outside of our control, specifically, the continued ability of motion picture and live theater producers to produce films and plays that are attractive to audiences, the amount of money spent by film distributors and theatrical producers to promote their motion pictures and plays, and the willingness of these producers to license their films on terms that are financially viable to our cinemas and to rent our theaters for the presentation of their plays. To the extent that popular movies and plays are produced, our cinema and live theater activities are ultimately dependent upon our ability, in the face of competition from other cinema and live theater operators to book these movies and plays into our facilities, and to provide a superior customer offering.\nWe rely on film distributors to supply the films shown in our theatres. In the U.S., the film distribution business is highly concentrated, with seven major film distributors accounting for approximately 89.5% of U.S. box office revenues. Numerous antitrust cases and the consent decree resulting from these antitrust cases affect the distribution of films. Consequently, we cannot guarantee a supply of films by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors. We are therefore required to negotiate licenses for each film and for each theatre. A deterioration of our relationship with any of the seven major film distributors could adversely affect our ability to obtain commercially successful films and to negotiate favorable licensing terms for such films, both of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIn the U.S., at least until recently, distributors have had broad discretion not to show the same film at competitive cinemas. This has, in many situations, given the larger exhibitors (as a result of their market power) power to influence distributors to exercise their discretion in this regard in favor of the larger exhibitors. In this industry, this is called \u201cclearance.\u201d Recent judicial decisions, however, have thrown doubt on the extent to which this practice will continue to be permitted under applicable antitrust laws.\nAdverse economic conditions could materially affect our business by reducing discretionary income and by limiting or reducing sources of film and live theater funding.\nCinema and live theater attendance is a luxury, not a necessity. Accordingly, a decline in the economy resulting in a decrease in discretionary income, or a perception of such a decline, may result in decreased discretionary spending, which could adversely affect our cinema and live theater businesses. Adverse economic conditions can also affect the supply side of our business, as reduced\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nliquidity can adversely affect the availability of funding for movies and plays. This is particularly true in the case of Off-Broadway plays, which are often times financed by high net worth individuals (or groups of such individuals) and that are very risky due to the absence of any ability to recoup investment in secondary markets like Blu-ray/DVD, cable, satellite or internet distribution.\nOur screen advertising revenue may decline.\nOver the past several years, cinema exhibitors have been looking increasingly to screen advertising as a way to improve income. No assurances can be given that this source of income will be continuing, or that the use of such advertising will not ultimately prove to be counterproductive, by giving consumers a disincentive to choose going to the movies over \u201cin-home\u201d or mobile entertainment alternatives.\nWe face uncertainty as to the timing and direction of technological innovations in the cinema exhibition business and as to our access to those technologies.\nWe have converted all of our cinema auditoriums to digital projection. However, no assurances can be given that other technological advances will not require us to make further material investments in our cinemas or face loss of business. Also, equipment is currently being developed for holographic or laser projection. The future of these technologies in the cinema exhibition industry is uncertain.\nWe face competition from new competitors offering food and beverage as an integral part of their cinema offerings.\nA number of new entrants, such as Alamo Drafthouse and iPic, offering an expanded food and beverage menu (including the sale of alcoholic beverages), have emerged in recent periods. In addition, some competitors are converting existing cinemas to provide such expanded menu offerings and in-theater dining options. The existence of such cinemas may alter traditional cinema selection practices of moviegoers, as they seek out cinemas with such expanded offerings as a preferred alternative to traditional cinemas.\nWe may be subject to increased labor and benefits costs.\nWe are subject to laws governing such matters as minimum wages, working conditions and overtime. As minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees, but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage. Labor shortages, increased employee turnover and health care mandates could also increase our labor costs. This in turn could lead us to increase prices which could impact our sales. Conversely, if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices, our results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nCyber security threats and our failure to protect our electronically stored data could adversely affect our business.\nWe store and maintain electronic information and data necessary to conduct our business. Data maintained in electronic form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. While we have adopted industry-accepted security measures and technology to protect the confidential and proprietary information, the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. As such, we may be unable to anticipate and implement adequate preventive measures in time. This may adversely affect our business, including exposure to government enforcement actions and private litigation, and our reputation with our customers and employees may be injured. In addition to Company-specific cyber threats or attacks, our business and results of operations could also be impacted by breaches affecting our peers and partners within the entertainment industry, as well as other retail companies.\n\ufeff\nReal Estate Development and Ownership Business Risks\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment in which we must compete against companies with much greater financial and human resources than we have.\nWe have limited financial and human resources, compared to our principal real estate competitors. In recent periods, we have relied heavily on outside professionals in connection with our real estate development activities. Many of our competitors have significantly greater resources and may be able to achieve greater economies of scale than we can.\nRisks Related to the Real Estate Industry Generally\nOur financial performance will be affected by risks associated with the real estate industry generally.\nEvents and conditions generally applicable to developers, owners, and operators of real property will affect our performance as well. These include (i) changes in the national, regional and local economic climate, (ii) local conditions, such as an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, commercial space and/or entertainment-oriented properties, (iii) reduced attractiveness of our properties to\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ntenants, (iv) the rental rates and capitalization rates applicable to the markets in which we operate and the quality of properties that we own, (v) competition from other properties, (vi) inability to collect rent from tenants, (vii) increased operating costs, including labor, materials, real estate taxes, insurance premiums, and utilities, (viii) costs of complying with changes in government regulations, (ix) the relative illiquidity of real estate investments, and (x) decreases in sources of both construction and long-term lending as traditional sources of such funding leave or reduce their commitments to real estate-based lending. In addition, periods of economic slowdown or recession, rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, could result in declining rents or increased lease defaults.\nWe may incur costs complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act and similar laws.\nUnder the Americans with Disabilities Act and similar statutory regimes in Australia and New Zealand or under applicable state or local law, all places of public accommodation (including cinemas and theaters) are required to meet certain governmental requirements related to access and use by persons with disabilities. A determination that we are not in compliance with those governmental requirements with respect to any of our properties could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The cost of addressing these issues could be substantial.\nIlliquidity of real estate investments could impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties.\nReal estate investments are relatively illiquid and, therefore, tend to limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. Many of our properties are either (i) \u201cspecial purpose\u201d properties that could not be readily converted to general residential, retail or office use, or (ii) undeveloped land. In addition, certain significant expenditures associated with real estate investment, such as real estate taxes and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment, and competitive factors may prevent the pass-through of such costs to tenants.\nReal estate development involves a variety of risks.\nReal estate development involves a variety of risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\nThe identification and acquisition of suitable development properties. Competition for suitable development properties is intense. Our ability to identify and acquire development properties may be limited by our size and resources. Also, as we and our affiliates are considered to be \u201cforeign owned\u201d for purposes of certain Australian and New Zealand statutes, we have been in the past, and may in the future be, subject to regulations that are not applicable to other persons doing business in those countries.\n\u00b7\nThe procurement of necessary land use entitlements for the project. This process can take many years, particularly if opposed by competing interests. Competitors and community groups (sometimes funded by such competitors) may object based on various factors, including, for example, impacts on density, parking, traffic, noise levels and the historic or architectural nature of the building being replaced. If they are unsuccessful at the local governmental level, they may seek recourse to the courts or other tribunals. This can delay projects and increase costs.\n\u00b7\nThe construction of the project on time and on budget. Construction risks include the availability and cost of financing; the availability and costs of material and labor; the costs of dealing with unknown site conditions (including addressing pollution or environmental wastes deposited upon the property by prior owners); inclement weather conditions; and the ever-present potential for labor-related disruptions.\n\u00b7\nThe leasing or sell-out of the project. Ultimately, there are risks involved in the leasing of a rental property or the sale of a condominium or built-for-sale property. For our ETCs, the extent to which our cinemas can continue to serve as an anchor tenant will be influenced by the same factors as will influence generally the results of our cinema operations. Leasing or sale can be influenced by economic factors that are neither known nor knowable at the commencement of the development process and by local, national, and even international economic conditions, both real and perceived.\n\u00b7\nThe refinancing of completed properties. Properties are often developed using relatively short-term loans. Upon completion of the project, it may be necessary to find replacement financing for these loans. This process involves risk as to the availability of such permanent or other take-out financing, the interest rates, and the payment terms applicable to such financing, which may be adversely influenced by local, national, or international factors. To date, we have been successful in negotiating development loans with \u201croll over\u201d or other provisions mitigating our need to refinance immediately upon completion of construction.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe ownership of properties involves risk.\nThe ownership of investment properties involves risks, such as: (i) ongoing leasing and re-leasing risks, (ii) ongoing financing and re-financing risks, (iii) market risks as to the multiples offered by buyers of investment properties, (iv) risks related to the ongoing compliance with changing governmental regulation (including, without limitation, environmental laws and requirements to remediate environmental contamination that may exist on a property (such as, by way of example, asbestos), even though not deposited on the property by us), (v) relative illiquidity compared to some other types of assets, and (vi) susceptibility of assets to uninsurable risks, such as biological, chemical or nuclear terrorism, or risks that are subject to caps tied to the concentration of such assets in certain geographic areas, such as earthquakes. Furthermore, as our properties are typically developed around an entertainment use, the attractiveness of these properties to tenants, sources of finance and real estate investors will be influenced by market perceptions of the benefits and detriments of such entertainment-type properties.\nA number of our assets are in geologically active areas, presenting risk of earthquake and land movement.\nWe have cinemas in California and New Zealand, areas that present a greater risk of earthquake and/or land movement than other locations. New Zealand has in recent periods had several major earthquakes damaging our facilities in Christchurch and Wellington. The ability to insure for such casualties is limited and may become more difficult and/or more expensive in future periods.\nWe may be subject to liability under environmental laws and regulations.\nWe own and operate a large number of cinemas and other properties within the U.S. and internationally, which may be subject to various foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment or human health. Such environmental laws and regulations include those that impose liability for the investigation and remediation of spills or releases of hazardous materials. We may incur such liability, including for any currently or formerly owned, leased or operated property, or for any site, to which we may have disposed, or arranged for the disposal of, hazardous materials or wastes. Certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability, including on a joint and several liability, which can result in a liable party being obliged to pay for greater than its share, regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal. Environmental conditions relating to our properties or operations could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and cash flows.\nLegislative or regulatory initiatives related to global warming/climate change concerns may negatively impact our business.\nRecently, there has been an increasing focus and continuous debate on global climate change including increased attention from regulatory agencies and legislative bodies. This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an as yet unspecified array of environmental matters. Legislative, regulatory or other efforts in the U.S. to combat climate change could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials, taxes, transportation and utilities for our vendors and for us which would result in higher operating costs for the Company. Also, compliance by our cinemas and accompanying real estate with new and revised environmental, zoning, land-use or building codes, laws, rules or regulations, could have a material and adverse effect on our business. However, we are unable to predict at this time, the potential effects, if any, that any future environmental initiatives may have on our business.\nInternational Business Risks\nOur international operations are subject to a variety of risks, including the following:\nCurrency Risk: while we report our earnings and net assets in U.S. dollars, substantial portions of our revenue and of our obligations are denominated in either Australian or New Zealand dollars. The value of these currencies can vary significantly compared to the U.S. dollar and compared to each other. We do not hedge the currency risk, but rather have relied upon the natural hedges that exist as a result of the fact that our film costs are typically fixed as a percentage of the box office, and our local operating costs and obligations are likewise typically denominated in local currencies. However, we do have debt at our parent company level that is serviced by our overseas cash flow, and our ability to service this debt could be adversely impacted by declines in the relative value of the Australian and New Zealand dollar compared to the U.S. dollar. Also, our use of local borrowings to mitigate the business risk of currency fluctuations has reduced our flexibility to move cash between jurisdictions. Set forth below is a chart of the exchange ratios between these three currencies over the past twenty years:\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nRisk of adverse government regulation: currently, we believe that relations between the United States, Australia, and New Zealand are good. However, no assurances can be given that this relationship will continue and that Australia and New Zealand will not in the future seek to regulate more highly the business done by U.S. companies in their countries.\n\u00b7\nRisk of adverse labor relations: deterioration in labor relations could lead to an increased cost of labor (including future government requirements with respect to pension liabilities, disability insurance and health coverage, and vacations and leave).\n\ufeff\nRisks Associated with Certain Discontinued Operations\nCertain of our subsidiaries were previously in industrial businesses. As a consequence, properties that are currently owned or may have in the past been owned by these subsidiaries may prove to have environmental issues. Where we have knowledge of such environmental issues and are in a position to make an assessment as to our exposure, we have established what we believe to be appropriate reserves, but we are exposed to the risk that currently unknown problems may be discovered. These subsidiaries are also exposed to potential claims related to exposure of former employees to coal dust, asbestos, and other materials now considered to be, or which in the future may be found to be, carcinogenic or otherwise injurious to health.\nOperating Results, Financial Structure and Borrowing Risk\nFrom time to time, we may have negative working capital.\nIn recent years, as we have invested our cash in new acquisitions and the development of our existing properties, we have from time-to-time had negative working capital. This negative working capital is typical in the cinema exhibition industry because our short-term liabilities are in part financing our long-term assets instead of long-term liabilities financing short-term assets, as is the case in other industries such as manufacturing and distribution.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe have substantial short to medium term debt.\nGenerally speaking, we have historically financed our operations through relatively short-term debt. No assurances can be given that we will be able to refinance this debt, or if we can, that the terms will be reasonable. However, as a counterbalance to this debt, we have significant unencumbered real property assets, which could be sold to pay debt or encumbered to assist in the refinancing of existing debt, if necessary.\nWe have substantial lease liabilities.\nMost of our cinemas operate in leased facilities. These leases typically have \u201ccost of living\u201d or other rent adjustment features and require that we operate the properties as cinemas. A downturn in our cinema exhibition business might, depending on its severity, adversely affect the ability of our cinema operating subsidiaries to meet these rental obligations. Even if our cinema exhibition business remains relatively constant, cinema level cash flow will likely be adversely affected unless we can increase our revenue sufficiently to offset increases in our rental liabilities. Unlike property rental leases, our newly added digital equipment leases do not have \u201ccost of living\u201d or other lease adjustment features.\nOur stock is thinly traded.\nOur stock is thinly traded, with an average daily volume in 2015 of only approximately 56,000 Class A Common shares. This can result in significant volatility, as demand by buyers and sellers can easily get out of balance.\nOwnership and Management Structure, Corporate Governance, and Change of Control Risks\nPending disputes among the Cotter family raise uncertainty regarding the ongoing control of the Company and may distract the time and attention of our officers and directors from our business and operations or interfere with the effective management of the Company.\n\ufeff\nUp until his death on September 13, 2014, James J. Cotter, Sr., the father of Ellen Cotter, James J. Cotter, Jr. and Margaret Cotter, was our controlling stockholder, having the sole power to vote approximately 66.9% of the outstanding voting stock of the Company. Under applicable Nevada Law, a stockholder holding more than 2/3rds of the Company\u2019s voting stock has the power at any time, with or without cause, to remove any one or more directors (up to and including the entire board of directors) by written consent taken without a meeting of the stockholders.\n\ufeff\nSince his death, disputes have arisen among Ellen Cotter, James J. Cotter, Jr. and Margaret Cotter concerning the voting control of those shares and regarding the exercise by the Estate of James J. Cotter, Sr. Deceased (the \u201cCotter Estate\u201d) of options to acquire an additional 100,000 shares of Class B Stock. At the present time, Ellen Cotter is the Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer of our Company. James J. Cotter, Jr. is a director and from June 2013 until June 12, 2015 was the President and from August 7, 2014 until June 12, 2015 was the Chief Executive Officer of our Company, having been removed from those positions by Board action on June 12, 2015. Margaret Cotter is the Vice-Chair of our Company and the President of Liberty Theaters, LLC, the company through which we own and operate our live theaters. She heads up the management and redevelopment of our New York properties.\n\ufeff\nAs of December 31, 2015, according to the books of the Company, the Living Trust established by Declaration of Trust dated June 5, 2013, by James J. Cotter, Sr. (the \u201cCotter Trust\u201d), held of record 696,080 shares of our Class B Voting Stock (\u201cVoting Stock\u201d) constituting approximately 41.4% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. According to the books of the Company, the Cotter Estate as of that date held of record an additional 427,808 shares of Voting Stock, constituting approximately 25.5% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. We are advised, based upon public filings made by one or more of Ellen Cotter, Margaret Cotter and James J. Cotter, Jr. (the \u201cCotter Filings\u201d) that the Voting Stock currently held of record by the Cotter Estate will eventually pour over into the Cotter Trust. We are further advised from the Cotter Filings that the Cotter Trust also provides for the establishment of a voting trust (the \u201cCotter Voting Trust\u201d) which will eventually hold the Voting Stock currently held by the Cotter Estate and the Cotter Trust. At the present time, however, such Voting Stock is held of record by the Cotter Trust and the Cotter Estate, respectively.\n\ufeff\nEllen Cotter, James J. Cotter, Jr. and Margaret Cotter are currently the trustees of the Cotter Trust. On December 22, 2014, the District Court of Clark County, Nevada appointed Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter as co-executors of the Cotter Estate. Accordingly, at the present time, Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter acting as a majority of the Trustees of the Cotter Trust with respect to the shares held by the Cotter Trust and as the co-executors of the Cotter Estate with respect to the shares held by the Cotter Estate (including the 100,000 shares of Voting Stock acquired by the Cotter Estate through the exercise of stock options previously granted to Mr. Cotter, Sr.), and voting in their individual capacity their direct holdings of 50,000 shares and 35,100 shares respectively of the Voting Stock, have the power to vote Voting Stock representing 71.9% of our outstanding Voting Stock.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe identity of the trustee(s) of the Cotter Voting Trust and the terms of that trust are in dispute as between Ellen Cotter, James J. Cotter, Jr. and Margaret Cotter.\n\ufeff\nWe are advised by the Cotter Filings that the 2013 amended and restated declaration of trust for the Cotter Trust names Margaret Cotter as the sole trustee of the Cotter Voting Trust and names James J. Cotter, Jr., as the first alternate trustee in the event that Margaret Cotter is unable or unwilling to act as trustee. We are further advised by the Cotter Filings that a 2014 partial amendment to the declaration of trust, signed by Mr. Cotter, Sr. while he was in the hospital, names Margaret Cotter and James J. Cotter, Jr. as co-trustees of the Cotter Voting Trust and provides that, in the event they are unable to agree upon an important trust decision, they shall rotate the voting of the Voting Stock between them annually on each January 1st. It further directs the trustees of the Cotter Voting Trust to, among other things, vote such shares of our Voting Stock held by the Cotter Voting Trust in favor of the election of Ellen Cotter, Margaret Cotter and James J. Cotter, Jr. to our board of directors and to rotate annually the chairmanship of our board between Ellen Cotter, Margaret Cotter and James J. Cotter, Jr.\n\ufeff\nOn February 6, 2015, Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter filed a Petition in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, captioned In re James J. Cotter Living Trust dated August 1, 2000 (Case No. BP159755) (the \u201cTrust Case\u201d). The Petition, among other things, seeks relief that could determine the validity of the 2014 partial amendment and who, as between Margaret Cotter and James J. Cotter Jr., has authority as trustee or co-trustees of the Cotter Voting Trust to vote the Cotter Voting Trust\u2019s shares of our Voting Stock (in whole or in part) and the scope and extent of such authority. James J. Cotter, Jr. has filed an opposition to the Petition and has filed pleadings in that proceeding seeking the removal of Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter as trustees of the Cotter Trust. The Trust Case is currently scheduled to be tried in July of this year.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, James J. Cotter, Jr. and certain other stockholders have filed two derivative actions (discussed in greater detail below) against Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter and certain of our Directors and officers, alleging a variety of misconduct on their part, and among other things seeking the reinstatement of James J. Cotter, Jr. as president and chief executive officer of our Company, challenging the voting by Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter of the shares held by the Cotter Estate, and seeking to void the result of the election of directors held at our 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. See discussion under the heading, Legal Proceedings; Derivative Litigation and James J. Cotter, Jr. Arbitration, infra.\n\ufeff\nAlthough the Company is not a party to the Trust Case and takes no position as to the claims asserted or the relief sought therein, the matters raised in the Trust Case create uncertainty regarding the ongoing control of the Company. Until these matters can be resolved, it is unclear whether, upon the creation of and the transfer of ownership of the Voting Stock to the Cotter Voting Trust, Margaret Cotter will be the sole trustee of the Cotter Voting Trust or whether Margaret Cotter and James J. Cotter. Jr. will be co-trustees of the Cotter Voting Trust. It is likewise uncertain, in the event that the court should determine that Margaret Cotter and James J. Cotter are co-trustees of the Cotter Voting Trust, how the power-sharing authority would be applied in practice.\n\ufeff\nThese pending matters could, in the future, potentially distract the time and attention of Ellen Cotter, James J. Cotter, Jr. and Margaret Cotter from the business and operations of our Company and thus potentially have an adverse effect on the effective management of our Company. Furthermore, the uncertainty as to the future management and control of our Company could potentially adversely impact, among other things (i) our ability to develop and maintain favorable business relationships, (ii) our ability to attract and retain talented and experienced directors, executives and employees, (iii) the compensation and other terms needed to attract and retain such individuals, (iv) our ability to borrow money on favorable long-term terms, and (v) our ability to pursue and complete long-term business objectives.\n\ufeff\nThe interests of our controlling stockholder may conflict with your interests.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Cotter Estate and the Cotter Trust beneficially own 66.9% of our outstanding Class B Stock. At the present time, according to the books of the Company, Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter vote (including their direct holdings of 50,000 shares and 35,100 shares respectively of the Class B Stock), Class B Stock representing 71.9% of our outstanding Class B Stock. Our Class A Stock is non-voting, while our Class B Stock represents all of the voting power of our Company. For as long as the Cotter Estate, the Cotter Trust and/or the Cotter Voting Trust (referred to herein collectively as the \u201cCotter Entities\u201d) continue to own shares of Class B Stock representing more than 50% of the voting power of our common stock, the Cotter Entities will be able to elect all of the members of our Board of Directors and determine the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including matters involving mergers or other business combinations, the acquisition or disposition of assets, the incurrence of indebtedness, the issuance of any additional shares of common stock or other equity securities and the payment of dividends on common stock. The Cotter Entities will also have the power to prevent or cause a change in control, and could take other actions that might be desirable to the Cotter Entities but not to other stockholders. To the extent that the Cotter Entities hold more than 2/3rds of our outstanding Class B Stock, the Cotter Entities will have the power at any time, with or without cause, to remove any one or more Directors (up to and including the entire board of directors) by written consent taken without a meeting of the stockholders.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn addition, the Cotter Estate or the Cotter Trust and/or their respective affiliates have controlling interests in companies in related and unrelated industries. In the future, we may participate in transactions with these companies (see Note 18 - Related Parties and Transactions).\n\ufeff\nWhile controlling stockholders may owe certain fiduciary duties to the company and/or minority stockholders, these duties are limited. No assurances can be given that the Cotter Entities will not take action that, while beneficial to them and legally enforceable, would not necessarily be in the best interests of our Company and/or our stockholders generally.\n\ufeff\nWe are a \u201cControlled Company\u201d under applicable NASDAQ Regulations. As permitted by those Regulations, our Board has elected to opt out of certain corporate governance rules applicable to non-controlled companies.\nGenerally speaking, the NASDAQ requires listed companies to meet certain minimum corporate governance provisions. However, a \u201cControlled Company\u201d, such as we, may elect not to be governed by certain of these provisions. Our Board of Directors has elected to exempt our Company from requirements that (i) at least a majority of our Directors be independent, (ii) nominees to our Board of Directors be nominated by a committee comprised entirely of independent Directors or by a majority of our Company\u2019s independent Directors, and (iii) the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer be determined or recommended to our Board of Directors by a compensation committee comprised entirely of independent Directors or by a majority of our Company\u2019s independent Directors. Notwithstanding the determination by our Board of Directors to opt-out of these NASDAQ requirements, we believe that a majority of our Board of Directors is nevertheless currently comprised of independent Directors, and our compensation committee is nevertheless currently comprised entirely of independent Directors. Nominations are considered by the Board, acting as a whole.\nWe depend on key personnel for our current and future performance.\nOur current and future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior management team and other key personnel. The loss or unavailability to us of any member of our senior management team or a key employee could significantly harm us. We cannot assure you that we would be able to locate or employ qualified replacements for senior management or key employees on acceptable terms. Due to the uncertainty of our control situation, the ongoing availability of these employees and our ability to replace them is uncertain.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 87533, "SIC": 7830, "TIC": "RDI"}
