{"cik": "1078075", "company": "NETSCOUT SYSTEMS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-05-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn addition to the other information in this report, the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating NetScout and our business.\nOur operating results and financial condition have varied in the past and may vary significantly in the future depending on a number of factors. Except for the historical information in this report, the matters contained in this report include forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. The following factors are among many that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in or implied by forward-looking statements made in this report. These statements involve the risks and uncertainties identified below as well as additional risks and uncertainties that are not yet identified or that we currently think are immaterial but may also impact our business operations. Such factors are among many that may have a material adverse impact upon our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nYou should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our results of operations, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nOur business and operations, and the operations of our customers, may be adversely affected by epidemics and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, which the World Health Organization has declared a \"pandemic.\" COVID-19 and future epidemics and pandemics risk disrupting and adversely affecting our business operations and financial results, as well as the markets and communities in which we and customers, suppliers and other business partners operate.\nWe face risks related to epidemics, pandemics and other outbreaks of communicable diseases that adversely affect global commercial activity, economies, financial markets, and companies. The recent outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a \"pandemic\" by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. An epidemic or pandemic or other outbreak of communicable diseases, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, poses the risk that we or our customers, suppliers, and other business partners may be disrupted or prevented from conducting normal business activities for certain periods of time, the durations of which are uncertain, and may otherwise experience significant impairments of business activities.\nThe President of the United States has declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national emergency. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many state, local, and foreign governments have put in place, and others in the future may put in place, quarantines, executive orders, shelter-in-place orders, and similar government orders and restrictions to reduce the rate of infection and control the spread of the disease. Such orders or restrictions, or the perception that such orders or restrictions could occur, have resulted in business closures, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, work-from-home policies, travel restrictions and cancellation of events, among other effects that could negatively impact productivity and disrupt our operations and those of our suppliers, customers, and business partners.\nTo protect our employees, contractors, customers, suppliers, and our local communities, and limit the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, we have directed NetScout employees at our locations globally to work remotely, with limited exceptions for site-essential personnel (with protective measures and protocols in place), and we may take further actions that alter our operations as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities, or by foreign governments in countries in which we operate, or which we determine are in the best interests of our employees, suppliers, customers, business partners, and stockholders. We expect that work from home requirements and other restrictions on our employees, suppliers, customers, and business partners will change over time, whether becoming more or less restrictive, as the pandemic and global responses progress.\nThere is a great deal of uncertainty as to when our employees will be able to return to work on-site. Similar to other companies we have begun planning for our employees to return to work on-site in phases in accordance with federal, state and local government guidelines, as well as in accordance with foreign governmental guidelines in the countries in which we operate. Furthermore, any process we implement to enable our employees to return to work on-site will be in accordance with\nprevailing health and science guidance, and in a manner that seeks to protect our employees, contractors, customers, suppliers and our local communities.\nAs part of our existing business continuity planning, we had established infrastructure and protocols to enable our employees to work from home, but we have never before required our employees to work remotely for such an extended period of time. While we believe that our employees are able to and can continue to effectively work remotely, it is possible that the disruptions to our business operations resulting from quarantines, self-isolations, or other movement and restrictions on the ability of our employees to perform their jobs could affect our ability to develop and design our products and services in a timely manner or meet required milestones or customer commitments, and that this could have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating results. In addition, although we have been able to adequately staff our facilities with site-critical personnel with specific health and safety protocols, to satisfy our manufacturing obligations to our customers, it is possible that we or others may determine that it is necessary to direct that employees engaged in manufacturing refrain from working on-site for an indeterminate period of time, and that this could have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating results.\nFurthermore, global travel has been sharply curtailed, and in some cases prohibited. Our sales personnel often meet with customers or prospective customers in person to provide greater personalized service. While our employees and customers have adjusted to virtual meetings, the inability of our sales personnel to meet with customers or prospective customers at a customer facility could have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating results.\nIn addition, we rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers in China and elsewhere. The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in the extended shutdown of certain businesses throughout the world, which may result in disruptions or delays to our supply chain. These may include disruptions from temporary closure of third-party supplier and manufacturer facilities, interruptions in product supply or restrictions on the export or shipment of our products, as well as the import of products into countries in which we operate. Although we have attempted to minimize the effects of these disruptions, it is possible that these attempts will be insufficient, and that these disruptions will likely have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 outbreak has been widespread and has adversely affected the global economy. While the potential impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business in particular may be difficult to assess or predict, the pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could decrease technology spending, adversely affecting demand for our products and services, and thus negatively affecting our revenues and operating results.\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely and respond appropriately. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the length of, and effectiveness of, measures taken to contain it or treat its impact, as well as actions taken by governmental authorities to address the economic impact of the outbreak.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \"Risk Factors\" section, such as those relating to our quarterly revenue and operating results, the estimates made for our critical accounting policies, and the operation of internal controls over such estimates, as well as on our liquidity and on our ability to satisfy our indebtedness obligations, including the compliance with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness.\nOur quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate.\nOur quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors associated with our industry, many of which may be outside of our control, including the following:\n\u2022the rate of growth of, and changes in technology trends in, our market and other industries in which we currently operate or may operate in the future;\n\u2022technology spending by current and potential customers, and the timing and size of orders from customers, especially in light of our lengthy sales cycle;\n\u2022reduced demand for our products and uneven demand for service delivery and network and application performance management solutions and network security solutions;\n\u2022the timing and market acceptance of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022the timing of hiring sales personnel and the speed at which such personnel become fully productive;\n\u2022our ability to develop and manufacture new products and technologies in a timely manner, the competitive position of our products, and the continued acceptance of our products by our customers and in the industries that we serve;\n\u2022changes in the number and size of our competitors, including the effects of new entrants and the effects of well-resourced competitors' increasing their investments in our markets, and changes in the prices and capabilities of competitors' products;\n\u2022customer ability to implement our products;\n\u2022cancellation, deferral, or limitation of orders by customers;\n\u2022changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022attrition of key employees and competition with other companies for employees with specific talents and experience;\n\u2022the number, severity, and timing of cyber-related threat outbreaks (e.g., malware, attacks, ransomware, worms and viruses);\n\u2022the quality and level of our execution of our business strategy and operating plan, and the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs;\n\u2022changes in accounting rules;\n\u2022costs related to acquisitions; and\n\u2022our ability to manage expenses.\nMost of our expenses, such as employee compensation, benefits and rent, are relatively fixed in the short term. Moreover, our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future revenue levels. As a result, if revenue for a particular quarter is significantly below our expectations, we may not be able to reduce operating expenses proportionately for that quarter, and, therefore, this revenue shortfall would have a disproportionately negative impact on our operating results for that quarter.\nIt may be necessary in the future to undertake cost reduction initiatives to improve profitability, which could lead to a deterioration of our competitive position. Any difficulties that we encounter as we reduce our costs could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.\nWe release guidance regarding our future performance on our quarterly earnings conference calls, quarterly earnings releases, and otherwise. Such guidance, which includes forward-looking statements, reflects our management\u2019s estimates as of the date of release and is based on projections prepared by our management. We may also decide not to release, or to defer, issuing guidance, where such guidance might not be appropriate or when we do not have sufficient visibility or clarity to issue such guidance. In those situations, we expect to communicate our reasons for not releasing or deferring release of guidance.\nProjections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. The principal reason that we release guidance is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We are not responsible for any projections or reports published by any such analysts or investors.\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results may vary from our guidance and the variations may be material. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged not to rely upon our guidance in making an investment decision regarding our common stock.\nAny failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this \"Risk Factors\" section in this report could result in the actual operating results being different from our guidance, and the differences may be adverse and material.\nOur indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow, and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nOn January 16, 2018, we amended and expanded our existing credit facility (Amended Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of lenders. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a five-year $1.0 billion senior secured revolving credit facility, including a letter of credit sub-facility of up to $75.0 million. We have used the new credit facility for working capital purposes and to finance the repurchase of common stock under our previously announced accelerated stock repurchase plan. The commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement will expire on January 16, 2023, and any outstanding loans will be due on that date. As of the date of this report, we had approximately $450 million in outstanding indebtedness under the\nAmended Credit Agreement. Our debt level can have negative consequences, including exposing us to future interest rate risk. We may incur significantly more debt in the future, and there can be no assurance that our cost of funding will not substantially increase. Our current revolving credit facility also imposes certain restrictions on us; for a more detailed description please refer to \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" Upon an event of default, for example, the administrative agent, with the consent of, or at the request of, the holders of more than 50% in principal amount of the loans and commitments may terminate the commitments and accelerate the maturity of the loans and enforce certain other remedies under the Amended Credit Agreement and other loan documents, which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. If we take on additional indebtedness, the risks described above could increase.\nInterest on the outstanding balances under the Amended Credit Agreement is calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. That announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for the administrative agent under the agreement to determine if (i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBOR rate or (ii) the FCA or governmental authority having jurisdiction over the administrative agent has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which the LIBOR rate shall no longer be used for determining interest rates for loans, and the administrative agent determines that both of these factors are unlikely to be temporary, then we and the administrative agent would agree to transition to an alternate base rate borrowing or amend the credit agreement to establish an alternate interest rate to LIBOR that includes consideration of the then-prevailing market convention for determining interest rates for syndicated loans in the United States at that time.\nWe are not able to predict whether LIBOR will actually cease to be available after 2021 or whether there will be another market benchmark in its place. Our Amended Credit Agreement defines an alternative rate to LIBOR which we have the option to select, the Alternate Base Rate which is equal to the greatest of (1) JPMorgan's prime rate, or (2) 0.50% in excess of the New York Federal Reserve Bank (NYFRB) rate. Any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the performance of LIBOR relative to its historic values. If the methods of calculating LIBOR change from current methods for any reason, or if LIBOR ceases to perform as it has historically, or if we select an alternative benchmark rate our interest expense associated with our outstanding indebtedness or any future indebtedness we incur may increase.\nAny failure to meet our debt obligations could damage our business.\nOur ability to meet our obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement will depend on market conditions and our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to remain profitable, or if we use more cash than we generate in the future, our level of indebtedness at such time could adversely affect our operations by increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions and by limiting or prohibiting our ability to obtain financing for additional capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes. In addition, if we are unable to make payments as required under the Amended Credit Agreement, we would be in default under the terms of the loans, which could seriously harm our business. If we incur significantly more debt, this could intensify the risks described above.\nWe may fail to secure necessary additional financing.\nOur future success may depend in part on our ability to obtain additional financing to support our continued growth and operations and any downgrades in our credit rating could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future or may affect the terms of any such financing. If our existing sources of liquidity are insufficient to satisfy our operating requirements, we may need to seek to raise capital by one or more of the following:\n\u2022issuing additional common stock or other equity instruments;\n\u2022acquiring additional bank debt;\n\u2022issuing debt securities; or\n\u2022obtaining lease financings.\nHowever, we may not be able to obtain additional capital when we want or need it, or capital may not be available on satisfactory terms. Furthermore, any additional capital may have terms and conditions that adversely affect our business, such as new financial or operating covenants, or that may result in dilution to our stockholders.\nWe expect that existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided from operations and our bank credit facilities will be sufficient to meet ongoing cash requirements. However, our failure to generate sufficient cash as our debt\nbecomes due or to renew credit lines prior to their expiration could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur effective tax rate may fluctuate, which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income.\nOur effective tax rate or the taxes we owe could be adversely affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:\n\u2022changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;\n\u2022changing tax laws, regulations, and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the requirements of certain tax rulings;\n\u2022changes in the research and development tax credit laws;\n\u2022earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates;\n\u2022the valuation of generated and acquired deferred tax assets and the related valuation allowance on these assets;\n\u2022transfer pricing adjustments;\n\u2022the tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between reporting periods; and\n\u2022tax assessments or any related tax interest or penalties that could significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in which the settlements take place.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and in numerous foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, we may receive notices that a tax authority in a particular jurisdiction believes that we owe a greater amount of tax than we have reported to such authority.\nWhile we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations. An adverse change in our effective tax rate could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and the price of our common stock could decline if our financial results are materially affected by an adverse change in our effective tax rate.\nWe may be impacted by changes in taxation, trade and other regulatory requirements.\nWe are subject to income tax in local, national and international jurisdictions. In addition, our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes (VAT) in many jurisdictions. We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. Additionally, changes in or the improper application of import and excise duties and or sales taxes or VAT may negatively impact our operating results. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. Fluctuations in tax rates and duties, changes in tax legislation or regulation or adverse outcomes of these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThere is increased uncertainty with respect to tax policy and trade relations between the U.S. and other countries. Major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur estimates and judgments related to critical accounting policies could be inaccurate.\nWe consider accounting policies related to revenue recognition, marketable securities, valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and other acquisition and divestiture accounting items, and share-based compensation to be critical in fully understanding and evaluating our financial results. Management makes judgments and creates estimates when applying these policies. These estimates and judgments affect, among other things, the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, the amounts of charges accrued by us, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made. If our estimates or the assumptions underlying them are not correct, actual results may differ materially from our estimates and we may need to, among other things, accrue additional charges or impair assets that could adversely impact our business. As a result, our operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not be effective.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all material errors and intentional misrepresentations. Any system of internal control can only provide reasonable assurance that all control objectives are met. Some of the potential risks involved could include, but are not limited to, management judgments, simple errors or mistakes, misinterpretation and willful misconduct regarding controls. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Compliance with this provision requires management's attention and expense. Management's assessment of our internal control over financial reporting may or may not identify weaknesses that need to be addressed in our internal control system. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock or impact our borrowing ability. In addition, changes in operating conditions and changes in compliance with policies and procedures currently in place may result in inadequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting in the future.\nForeign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements.\nAn increasing portion of our revenue is derived from international operations. Our consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars. Most of the revenue and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in local currencies. Given that cash is typically received over an extended period of time for many of our license agreements and given that a material and increasing portion of our revenue is generated outside of the United States, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates (including the Euro) against the U.S. dollar could result in substantial changes in reported revenues and operating results due to the foreign exchange impact upon translation of these transactions into U.S. dollars.\nIn the normal course of business, we employ various hedging strategies to partially mitigate these risks, including the use of derivative instruments. These strategies may not be effective in fully protecting us against the effects of fluctuations from movements in foreign exchange rates, including the increased volatility in foreign exchange rates following the COVID-19 outbreak and future global pandemics and other events. Fluctuations of the foreign exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\nAdditionally, sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar increases the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, which may require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices. Decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials, products and services we purchase overseas. Sales and expenses of our non-U.S. businesses are also translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects. In addition, we may invoice customers in a currency other than the functional currency of our business, and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could also result in unfavorable translation effects. We also face exchange rate risk from our investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries.\nIf our products contain errors or quality issues, such issues may be costly to correct, revenue may be delayed, we could be sued, and our reputation could be harmed.\nOur products are inherently complex and, despite testing by our customers and us, errors or quality issues may be found in our products after commencement of commercial shipments, especially when products are first introduced or when new versions are released. These errors may result from components supplied by third parties incorporated into our products, which makes us dependent upon the cooperation and expertise of such third parties for the diagnosis and correction of such errors. If errors are discovered, we may not be able to correct them in a timely manner or at all. In addition, we may need to make significant expenditures to eliminate errors and failures. Errors and failures in our products could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and could damage our reputation. Regardless of the source of these defects or errors, we may need to divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to address the detection and correction of these errors and defects. If one or more of our products fail, a customer may assert warranty and other contractual claims for substantial damages against us. Our contracts with customers contain provisions relating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, which may not be upheld. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management's attention and harm the market's perception of us and our products. In addition, if our business liability insurance coverage proves inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nThe occurrence or discovery of these types of errors or failures could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Any such errors, defects, or security vulnerabilities could also adversely affect the market's perception of our products and business.\nIf we fail to introduce new products and solutions or enhance our existing products and solutions to keep up with rapid technological change, demand for our products and solutions may decline.\nThe market for application and network performance management, service assurance, cybersecurity solutions, and business intelligence is highly competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements, increasing competition, and frequent product introductions and enhancements. Our success is dependent upon our ability to meet our customers' needs, which are driven by changes in technologies, new application technologies, new security risks and the emergence of new industry standards. In addition, new technologies may shorten the life cycle for our products and solutions or could render our existing or planned products and services less competitive or obsolete. We must address demand from our customers for advancements in our products and services applications in order to support our customers' growing needs and requirements. In order to meet this challenge and remain competitive in the market, we must introduce new enhancements and additional form factors to our existing product lines and service offerings. If we are unable to develop, introduce and communicate new network and application performance management and service assurance products, network security products, business intelligence products, and solutions or enhancements to existing products in a timely and successful manner, this inability could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAs our success depends in part on our ability to develop product enhancements and new products and solutions that keep pace with continuing changes in technology, cyber risk and customer preferences, we must devote significant resources to research and development, development and introduction of new products and enhancements on a timely basis, and obtaining market acceptance for our existing products and new products. We have introduced and intend to continue to introduce new products and solutions, including increased migration to \"software as a service\" and software-deployed products. If the introduction of these products and solutions is significantly delayed or if we are unsuccessful in bringing these products and solutions to market, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted. We are developing and are already deploying a number of new products as well as enhancements to our existing products and offerings, including software only solutions and products available in multiple form factors.\nWe must invest in research and development in order to remain competitive in our industry. However, there can be no assurances that continued investment and increased research and development expenses will ultimately result in our maintaining or increasing our market share, which could result in a decline in our operating results. The process of developing new solutions is complex and uncertain; we must commit significant resources to developing new services or features without knowing whether our investments will result in services or features the market will accept. If our research and development expenses increase without a corresponding increase in our revenues, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Also, we may not be able to successfully complete the development and market introduction of new products or product enhancements in a timely manner. If we fail to develop and deploy new products and product enhancements on a timely basis, or if we fail to gain market acceptance of our new products, our revenues will likely decline, and we may lose market share to our competitors.\nThe move to software focused products requires higher unit sales.\nTo address customer requirements for future technology changes such as \"edge computing\" and to reduce the environmental impacts of our products, we have increased and are continuing to increase our software offerings. While software products have a higher overall sales margin than that of bundled hardware and software products, the per unit revenue for software-only sales is lower than for sales that include software/hardware bundles. Therefore, in order to increase overall revenue, we will need to sell more units of software-only products to meet or exceed the revenues generated by software/hardware bundled products.\nWe face significant competition from other technology companies.\nThe service assurance, application performance management, network security and business intelligence markets are highly competitive, rapidly evolving, and fragmented markets that have overlapping technologies and competitors, both large and small, and we expect competition on offerings and pricing to increase. We believe customers make service management system, network security and business intelligence purchasing decisions based primarily upon the following factors:\n\u2022product and service performance, functionality and price;\n\u2022timeliness of new product and service introductions;\n\u2022network capacity;\n\u2022ease of installation, integration, and use;\n\u2022customer service and technical support;\n\u2022name and reputation of vendor;\n\u2022quality and value of the product and services; and\n\u2022alliances with industry partners.\nWe compete with a growing number of providers of service assurance, application performance management solutions, network security offerings and portable network traffic analyzers and probes, as well as with providers of business intelligence services. In addition, leading network equipment, network security and service assurance and application technology vendors offer their own management solutions, including products which they license from other competitors. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and substantially greater financial, management, marketing, service, support, technical, distribution and other resources than we do. In addition, some of our customers develop their own in-house solutions to meet their technological needs. Further, in recent years some of our competitors have been acquired by larger companies that are seeking to enter or expand in the markets in which we operate. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions in an evolving industry. Therefore, given their larger size and greater resources, our competitors may be able to respond more effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards and customer requirements.\nAs a result of the competitive factors highlighted in this section and in other risk factors, we may not be able to compete effectively with our current or future competitors. If we are unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges or if existing or new competitors gain market share in any of our markets, our competitive position could weaken and we could experience a decline in our sales that could adversely affect our business and operating results. This competition could result in increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses, and failure to increase, or the loss of market share, any of which would likely have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIncreased customer demands on our technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results.\nWe offer technical support services with many of our products. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. We also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors. Our customers depend on our support organization to resolve issues relating to our products deployed on their networks. A high level of support is critical for continued relationships with our customers. If we or our channel partners do not effectively assist our customers in deploying our products, succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues, and provide effective ongoing support, it would adversely affect our ability to sell our products to existing customers and would harm our reputation with existing and potential customers. Any failure to maintain high quality support and services would harm our operating results and reputation. Further, if customers demand these services, and we cannot adequately meet their demand, or if we cannot realize revenues in connection with our provision of services related to product support, it could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to manage growth properly and to implement enhanced automated systems could adversely impact our business.\nThe growth in size and complexity of our business and our customer base has been and will continue to be a challenge to our management and operations. Additional growth will place significant demands on our management, infrastructure, and other resources. To manage further growth effectively, we must hire, integrate, and retain highly skilled personnel qualified to manage our expanded operations. We will also need to continue to improve our financial and management controls, reporting systems, and procedures. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our costs, the quality of our products, the effectiveness of our sales organization, attraction and retention of key personnel, our business, our operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted. To manage our growth effectively, we may need to implement new or enhanced automated infrastructure technology and systems.\nAny disruptions or ineffectiveness relating to our systems implementations and enhancements could adversely affect our ability to process customer orders, ship products, provide services and support to our customers, bill and track our customers, fulfill contractual obligations, and otherwise run our business.\nAs a result of the diversification of our business, personnel growth, acquisitions and international expansion in recent years, most of our employees are now based outside of our headquarters. If we are unable to appropriately increase management depth and enhance succession planning, we may not be able to achieve our financial or operational goals. It is also important to our continued success that we hire qualified employees, properly train them and manage out poorly performing personnel, all while maintaining our corporate culture and spirit of innovation. If we are not successful at these efforts, our growth and operations could be adversely affected.\nAs our business evolves, we must also expand and adapt our information technology (IT) and operational infrastructure. Our business relies on our data systems, billing systems and other operational and financial reporting and control systems. All of these systems have become increasingly complex due to the diversification and complexity of our business, acquisitions of new businesses with different systems. To manage our technical support infrastructure effectively and improve our sales efficiency, we will need to continue to upgrade and improve our data systems, billing systems, ordering processes, customer relationship management systems, and other operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. These upgrades and improvements may be difficult and costly, and they may require employees to dedicate a significant amount of time to implement. If we are unable to adapt our systems and organization in a timely, efficient and cost-effective manner to accommodate changing circumstances, our business may be adversely affected. If the third parties we rely on for hosted data solutions for our internal network and information systems are subject to a security breach or otherwise suffer disruptions that impact the services we utilize, the integrity and availability of our internal information could be compromised causing the loss of confidential or proprietary information, damage to our reputation and economic loss.\nWe may not successfully complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions we do make, which could impair our ability to compete and could harm our operating results.\nWe may need to acquire complementary businesses, products or technologies to remain competitive or expand our business. We actively investigate and evaluate potential acquisitions of complementary businesses, products and technologies in the ordinary course of business. We may compete for acquisition opportunities with entities having significantly greater resources than we have. As a result, we may not succeed in acquiring some or all businesses, products or technologies that we seek to acquire. Our inability to effectively consummate acquisitions on favorable terms could significantly impact our ability to compete effectively in our targeted markets and could negatively affect our results of operations.\nAcquisitions that we do complete could adversely impact our business. The potential adverse consequences from acquisitions include:\n\u2022the potentially dilutive issuance of common stock or other equity instruments;\n\u2022the incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to acquired intangible assets;\n\u2022the potentially costly and disruptive impact of assuming unfavorable pre-existing contractual relationships of acquired companies that we would not have otherwise entered into and potentially exiting or modifying such relationships;\n\u2022the potential litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of, an acquisition including claims from terminated employees, customers, third parties or enforcement actions by various regulators;\n\u2022the incurrence of significant costs and expenses to complete the acquisition and integrate the acquired business; and\n\u2022the potentially negative impact of poor performance of an acquisition on our earnings per share.\nAcquisition transactions also involve numerous business risks. These risks from acquisitions include:\n\u2022difficulties in assimilating the acquired operations, technologies, personnel and products;\n\u2022difficulties in managing geographically dispersed operations;\n\u2022difficulties in assimilating diverse financial reporting and management information systems as well as differing ordering processes and customer relationship management systems;\n\u2022difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022use of cash to pay for acquisitions that may limit other potential uses of our cash, including stock repurchases and repayment of outstanding indebtedness;\n\u2022substantial accounting charges for restructuring and related expenses, write-off of in-process research and development, impairment of goodwill, amortization or impairment of intangible assets and share-based compensation expense;\n\u2022the potential disruption of our business;\n\u2022the potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors or suppliers;\n\u2022the inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; and\n\u2022the potential for delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty and the inability to maintain relationships with customers of the acquired businesses.\nIf we are not able to successfully manage these issues, the anticipated benefits and efficiencies of the acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and our ability to compete, our revenue and gross margins and our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to quickly and successfully recover from a disaster, public health crisis (including a global pandemic such as COVID-19), or other business continuity event could affect our ability to deliver our products and cause reputational harm to our business.\nThe occurrence of a natural disaster, public health crisis (including a global pandemic such as COVID-19) or an act of terrorism, or a decision or need to close any of our facilities without adequate notice or time for making alternative arrangements could result in interruptions in the delivery of our products and services. Our central business functions, including administration, human resources, finance services, legal, development, manufacturing and customer support depend on the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other technology systems and operations, some of which are operated or hosted by third parties.\nA disruption or failure of these systems or operations because of a disaster, public health crisis (including a global pandemic such as COVID-19) or other business continuity event could cause data to be lost or otherwise delay our ability to complete sales and provide the highest level of service to our customers. In addition, we could have difficulty producing accurate financial statements on a timely basis, which could have an impact on our ability to make timely disclosures and could adversely affect the trading value of our stock. Although we endeavor to ensure there is redundancy in these systems and that they are regularly backed-up, there are no assurances that data recovery in the event of a disaster would be effective or occur in an efficient manner. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. We could experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario.\nVulnerabilities and critical security defects, prioritization decisions regarding remedying vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third party providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects, or customers not deploying security releases or deciding not to upgrade products, services or solutions could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business.\nThe products and services we sell to customers, and our cloud-based solutions, may contain vulnerabilities or critical security defects which have not been remedied and cannot be disclosed without compromising security. We may also make prioritization decisions in determining which vulnerabilities or security defects to fix, and the timing of these fixes, which could result in an exploit that compromises security.\nCustomers also need to test security releases before they can be deployed which can delay implementation. In addition, we rely on third-party providers of software and cloud-based services and we cannot control the rate at which they remedy vulnerabilities. Customers may also not deploy a security release, or decide not to upgrade to the latest versions of our products, services or cloud-based solutions containing the release, leaving them vulnerable.\nAn actual, alleged, or perceived security breach, cyberattack or incident against us could interrupt our operations, create a perception that our products and services are vulnerable, and damage our brand and reputation, which could reduce revenue, increase expenses, and expose us to legal claims or regulatory actions.\nOur IT networks, software and systems, and those of our service providers and partners, may be vulnerable to a wide variety of security breaches, cyberattacks and other incidents, including but not limited to traditional computer \u201chackers,\u201d malicious code (such as viruses, ransomware and worms), data theft, phishing attempts and other social engineering schemes, employee mistake, theft or misuse, denial of service attacks, and nation-state and nation-state-supported actors engaged in attacks and intrusions. Although we have controls and security measures in place to prevent cyberattacks, experienced computer hackers are increasingly organized and sophisticated. Malicious attack efforts operate on a large-scale and sometimes offer targeted attacks as a paid for service. In addition, the techniques they use to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target. As a provider of security solutions, we may be a more attractive target for such attacks. Other individuals or entities, including employees or vendors, may also intentionally or unintentionally provide unauthorized access to our IT environments or to our customers' IT environments.\nIf we, our service providers, or our partners were to experience a security breach, cyberattack or other incident, our service availability, IT systems and networks could be impacted, we or our customers may experience system disruptions or\nslowdowns, security vulnerabilities of our products could be exploited, the information stored on our networks or those of our third-party service providers or partners could be accessed, publicly disclosed, altered, lost, or stolen, all of which could subject us to liability and cause us financial harm. Any actual, alleged or perceived security breach or incident affecting us, our service providers, our partners or our industry as a whole could result in damage to our reputation, negative publicity, loss of partners, customers and sales, increased costs to remedy any problems and otherwise respond to any incident, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, costly litigation, and other liability. In addition, we could incur substantial costs and liabilities, including but not limited to, expenses attributable to investigating, remediating and rectifying a security breach, cyberattack or other incident (including the cost of repairing any damage to our or our customers' systems), liability for stolen assets or information, lost revenue and income resulting from any system or product downtime, increased costs for cybersecurity protection, and costs to comply with any notification obligations resulting from any security incidents. Such outcomes could damage our reputation, cause customers and possibly investors to lose confidence in us, and adversely affect our business or operating results.\nAdditionally, efforts by hackers or others could cause interruptions, delays or cessation of our product licensing, or modification of our software, which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers. If these efforts are successful and a third party obtains unauthorized access to our or our customers' IT environments, our business operations, and those of our customers could be adversely affected, losses or theft of data could occur, our reputation and future sales could be harmed, governmental regulatory action or private or governmental litigation could be commenced against us and our business, and our financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur reliance on sole source suppliers could adversely impact our business.\nSpecific components that are necessary for the hardware assembly of our instruments are obtained from separate sole source suppliers or a limited group of suppliers. These components include our network interface cards and proprietary hardware. Our reliance on sole or limited suppliers involves several risks, including a lack of control over the manufacturing process and inventory management and potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components and the inability to exercise control over pricing, quality and timely delivery of components. For most of our products, we do not have the internal manufacturing capabilities to meet our customers' demands. It is our practice to mitigate these risks by partnering with key suppliers, including distributors, to establish a variety of supply continuity practices. These practices may include, among other approaches, establishing buffer supply requiring suppliers to maintain adequate stocks of materials, bonding agreements with distributors, and use-based and kanban programs to set supply thresholds. We also enter into escrow arrangements for certain technologies. Where possible, we use widely-available off the shelf hardware and work with large suppliers with multiple factories and other risk management practices. However, failure of supply or failure to execute effectively on any of these programs, including as a result of a public health crisis (included a global pandemic such as COVID-19) could result in our inability to obtain adequate deliveries or the occurrence of any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply for these components would impact our ability to ship our products on a timely basis. Moreover, if we are unable to continue to acquire from these suppliers on acceptable terms, or should any of these suppliers cease to supply us with components for any reason, we may not be able to identify and integrate an alternative source of supply in a timely fashion or at the same costs. Any transition to one or more alternate manufacturers would likely result in delays, operational problems and increased costs, and may limit our ability to deliver our products to our customers on time for such transition period. These risks could damage relationships with our current and prospective customers, cause shortfalls in expected revenue, and could materially and adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or applicable anti-bribery laws in other countries, or if we fail to comply with U.S. export controls and government contracting laws, our business could be harmed.\nWe earn a significant portion of our total revenues from international sales. As a result, we must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and others, as well as anti-competition regulations.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which continues to see increased enforcement in recent years, generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment and requires companies to maintain appropriate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately reflect the transactions of the company. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for actions taken by agents or local partners or representatives. In addition, regulators may seek to hold us liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies which we acquire. We are also subject to the U.K. Bribery Act and may be subject to certain anti-corruption laws of other countries in which we do business.\nIn addition to anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, we are also subject to the export and re-export control laws of the U.S., including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC), as well as to U.S. government contracting laws, rules and regulations, and may be subject to government contracting laws of other countries in which we do business. If we or our distributors, resellers, agents, or other intermediaries fail to comply with the FCPA, the EAR, OFAC or U.S. government contracting laws, or the anti-corruption, export or governmental contracting laws of other countries, governmental authorities in the U.S. or other countries could seek to impose civil and/or criminal penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows.\nViolations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries. Such violations could also adversely affect our reputation with existing and prospective customers, which could negatively impact our operating results and growth prospects.\nThe failure to recruit and retain qualified personnel and plan for and manage the succession of key executives could hinder our ability to successfully manage our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results.\nWe operate in businesses where there is intense competition for experienced personnel in all of our global markets and have, in some instances, experienced attrition of our employees to direct and indirect competitors. We depend on our ability to identify, recruit, hire, train, develop and retain qualified and effective professionals and to attract and retain talent needed to execute our business strategy. Our future success depends in large part upon our ability to attract, train, motivate and retain highly skilled employees, particularly executives, sales and marketing personnel, software engineers, and technical support personnel. The complexity of our products, processing functionality, software systems and services require highly trained professionals. While we presently have a sophisticated, dedicated and experienced team of employees who have a deep understanding of our business lines, the labor market for these individuals has historically been very competitive due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding. If we are unable to attract and retain the highly skilled technical personnel that are integral to our sales, marketing, product development and technical support teams, the rate at which we can generate sales and develop new products or product enhancements may be limited. This inability could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, we must maintain and periodically increase the size of our sales force in order to increase our direct sales and support our indirect sales channels. Because our products are very technical, sales-people require a comparatively long period of time to become productive, typically three to twelve months. This lag in productivity, as well as the challenge of attracting qualified candidates, may make it difficult to meet our sales force growth targets. Further, we may not generate sufficient sales to offset the increased expense resulting from growing our sales force. If we are unable to maintain and periodically expand our sales capability, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted.\nLoss of key personnel could adversely impact our business. Our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of Anil Singhal, our President, Chief Executive Officer, and co-founder, and our other key executive officers and senior managers to work effectively as a team. Effective succession planning is also important for our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfers of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. The loss of one or more of our key personnel could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. We must, therefore, plan for and manage the succession of key executives due to retirement, illness or competitive offers elsewhere.\nWe assumed certain non-U.S. pension benefit obligations associated with the business acquired in the Comms Transaction. Future funding obligations related to these liabilities could restrict cash available for our operations, capital expenditures or other requirements, or require us to borrow additional funds.\nAs part of the Comms Transaction, we assumed certain unfunded non-U.S. pension obligations related to non-U.S. employees of the Communications Business. While we intend to comply with any future funding obligations for our non-U.S. pension benefit plans through the use of cash from operations, there can be no assurance that we will generate enough cash to do so and also meet our other required or intended cash uses. Our inability to fund these obligations through cash from operations could require us to seek funding from other sources, including through additional borrowings, which could materially increase our outstanding debt or debt service requirements.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to manage and leverage our distribution channels. Disruptions to, or our failure to effectively develop and manage, these partners and the processes and procedures that support them could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products and services. Managing these distribution\nchannels and relationships requires experienced personnel, and lack of sufficient expertise could lead to a decrease in sales of our products and services, which could cause our operating results to suffer.\nOur future success may require us to increase the number and depth of our indirect sales efforts through our distributors and channel partners and to leverage those relationships to expand these our distribution channels and to develop new indirect distribution channels to increase revenue. Our channel partners have no obligation to purchase any products from us. Some of our distribution and channel partners also distribute and sell competitive products and services and the reduction in sales by these partners could materially reduce our revenues. In addition, they could internally develop products that compete with our solutions or partner with our competitors and bundle or resell competitors' solutions, possibly at lower prices. The potential inability to develop relationships with new partners in new markets, expand and manage our existing partner relationships, the unwillingness of our partners to market and sell our products effectively or the loss of existing partnerships could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Our international operations, including our operations in the United Kingdom, mainland Europe, India, Asia-Pacific and other regions, are generally also subject to the risk of longer sales cycles through our international distribution channels. Sales to customers outside the United States accounted for 39%, 39%, and 41% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe need to develop such relationships can be particularly acute in areas outside of the U.S. Recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in the use of our technology and services and ensuring that they comply with our legal and ethical expectations requires significant time and resources.\nOur failure to maintain and increase the number and quality of relationships with channel partners, and any inability to successfully execute on the partnerships we initiate, could significantly impede our revenue growth prospects in the short and long term.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to manage our international research and development operations and related partnerships. Our international research and development efforts may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits and involve competitive and other risks.\nWe must continue to enhance our existing products and introduce new products in order to keep up with rapid technological change. Our international research and development teams play a critical role in these efforts. We must attract, train, motivate and retain our international research and development team members. To maintain this international employee research and development talent, we believe we must provide our international engineers with compelling and strategically significant work, coupled with technical and architectural ownership of their respective development projects. We must develop the leaders of these international teams, while ensuring their frequent inclusion and participation in corporate strategic and operational planning. We are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. These development efforts also involve risks, including, knowledge transfer issues related to our technology and resulting exposure to misappropriation of intellectual property or information that is proprietary to us, heightened exposure to economic, security and political conditions abroad, and exchange rate and tax compliance issues. The risks related to our research and development efforts abroad could increase our expenses, impair our development efforts, harm our competitive position and damage our reputation. If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nNecessary licenses for third-party technology may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nWe currently and will in the future license technology from third parties that we use to produce or embed in our products. While we have generally been able to license required third-party technology to date, third-party licenses required in the future may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Third parties who hold exclusive rights to technology that we seek to license may include our competitors. If we are unable to obtain any necessary third-party licenses, we would be required to redesign our product or obtain substitute technology, which may not perform as well, be of lower quality or be more costly. The loss of these licenses or the inability to maintain any of them on commercially acceptable terms could delay development of future products or the enhancement of existing products. We may also choose to pay a premium price for such a license in certain circumstances where continuity of the licensed product would outweigh the premium cost of the license. The unavailability of these licenses or the necessity of agreeing to commercially unreasonable terms for such licenses could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights.\nOur business is heavily dependent on our intellectual property. We rely upon a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and registrations and non-disclosure and other contractual and license arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights. The reverse engineering, unauthorized copying, or other misappropriation of our intellectual property could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without compensating us. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign jurisdictions do not offer the same protections for our proprietary rights as the laws of the United States, and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products in those countries. Legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights could be burdensome and expensive and could involve a high degree of uncertainty. In addition, legal proceedings may divert management's attention from growing our business. There can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information, or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use by third parties and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights. The unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary information could result in reduced sales of our products and eventually harm our operating results.\nOthers may claim that we infringe on their intellectual property rights.\nFrom time to time we have been and may continue to be subject to claims by others that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights, patents, copyrights or trademarks. In some cases, we may have agreed to indemnify our customers and partners if our products or technology infringe or misappropriate specified third party intellectual property rights; therefore, we could become involved in litigation or claims brought against our customers or partners if our products or technology are the subject of such allegations. These claims, whether or not valid, could require us to spend significant sums in litigation, pay damages or royalties, delay product shipments, reengineer our products, rename our products and rebuild name recognition or acquire licenses to such third-party intellectual property. We may not be able to secure any required licenses on commercially reasonable terms or secure them at all. Any of these claims or resulting events could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nUncertainties of regulation of the Internet and data traveling over the Internet could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be materially adversely affected by increased regulation of the Internet and Internet commerce in any country where we operate, as well as access to or commerce conducted on the Internet. Further, governments may further regulate or restrict the sales, licensing, distribution, and export or import of certain technologies to certain countries. The adoption of additional regulation of the Internet and Internet commerce could decrease demand for our products, and, at the same time, increase the cost of selling our products, which could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe rapid evolution and increasing enforcement of privacy and security laws and regulations and standards around the world could require significant company resources, limit certain functionalities of our products, and harm our business.\nWe are subject to federal, state, local, and international laws, regulations, directives, and standards relating to the collection, use, retention, disclosure, security, transfer, and other processing of personally identifiable information. The regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving, and as a result, implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. We publicly post documentation regarding our practices concerning the processing, use, and disclosure of data. Any failure, or allegations of failure, by us, our suppliers, or other parties with whom we do business to comply with this documentation or with other federal, state, local or foreign laws, regulations, directives, and standards could result in investigations and/or proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. In many jurisdictions, enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are rising. In the United States, these include enforcement actions in response to rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of federal agencies, state attorneys general, states' legislation, and consumer protection agencies. In addition, privacy advocates and industry groups have regularly proposed, and may propose in the future, self-regulatory standards with which we must legally comply or that contractually apply to us. If we fail to follow these security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, we may incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in costs.\nInternationally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply. For example, the European Union (EU) has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which went into effect on May 25, 2018, and introduced numerous privacy-related obligations for companies operating in the EU, including greater control for data subjects, increased data portability for EU consumers, data\nbreach notification requirements, and increased fines. In particular, under the GDPR, fines of up to 20 million euros or up to 4% of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater, could be imposed for violations of certain of the GDPR\u2019s requirements. The GDPR requirements apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries, including employee information.\nThe international data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, resulting in possible significant operational costs for internal compliance and risk to our business. For example, we rely upon the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework and EU Standard Contractual Clauses in our data export agreements as legal bases for transferring personal data outside of the European Economic Arena (EEA). Both of these frameworks are subject to ongoing review by governmental bodies and legal challenges which may result in a ruling that the industry-standard measures we, and other companies, have taken are no longer sufficient. As a result, in the future we may need to take additional measures to ensure compliance with respect to our transfers of personal data outside of the EEA.\nIn addition to the GDPR, the European Commission is considering additional regulations that could affect us and our customers and other companies by requiring additional regulation of communication services, which may increase our compliance burden and affect product offerings.\nComplying with international data protection laws may cause us to incur additional operational costs or require us to change our business practices. Despite our efforts, we may not be successful in achieving compliance either due to internal or external factors such as lack of vendor cooperation. Any actual or perceived non-compliance could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities, customers, data subjects, or others.\nDomestic laws in this area are also complex and developing rapidly. In recent years, there have been a number of well-publicized data breaches involving the improper dissemination of personal information of individuals. Many states have adopted legislation that regulates how businesses operate online, including measures relating to privacy, data security and data breaches. For example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which took effect on January 1, 2020, and provides its residents expanded rights to access and to delete their personal information, opt out rights to certain personal information sharing, and detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA and its regulations may increase our compliance costs and potential liability.\nBecause the interpretation and application of privacy and data protection laws are uncertain, it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our products and platform capabilities. If so, we could be required to change our business activities and practices or modify our products and platform capabilities, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Any inability by us to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy and data security laws, regulations, and policies or our contracts governing our processing of personal information, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations, and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our customers or to our marketing and promotion of our products to interested individuals may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe or our suppliers may be impacted by new regulations related to climate change or other environmental issues.\nWe or our suppliers may become subject to new laws enacted with regards to climate change or other environmental issues. In the event that new laws are enacted or current laws are modified in countries in which we or our suppliers operate, we could face increased costs in order to comply with these laws. These costs may be incurred across various levels of our supply chain in order to comply with new environmental regulations, as well as by us in connection with our manufacturing of products, including costs related to incorporation of substitute materials and other product re-design costs, as well as costs associated with product recalls. In addition, we may be unable to service existing products if certain materials are no longer compliant with new regulations, which could cause us to incur increased costs in order to satisfy service obligations to customers. Additionally, our flow of product may be impacted which could delay the recognition of revenue and have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nThe current economic and geopolitical environment may impact some specific industries into which we sell and may lead our customers to delay or forgo technology investments and could have other impacts, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nMany of our customers are concentrated in certain industries, including financial services, public sector, healthcare, and the service provider market. Certain industries may be more acutely affected by economic, geopolitical and other factors, including public heath crises (including global pandemics such as COVID-19), and changes in U.S. trade policy with China and\nother countries, than other sectors. Our public sector customers are affected by federal, state and local budget decisions. To the extent that one or more of the sectors in which our customer base operates is adversely impacted, whether as a result of general conditions affecting all sectors or as a result of conditions affecting only those particular sectors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted. If companies in our target markets reduce capital expenditures, we may experience a reduction in sales, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies as well as downward pressure on the price of our products. There can be no assurance that any decrease in sales resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak will be offset by increased sales in subsequent periods. Although the magnitude of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business and operations remains uncertain, the continued spread of COVID-19 or the occurrence of other epidemics and the imposition of related public health measures and travel and business restrictions could adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nInternational economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements and growth.\nWe expect to continue to develop our sales and presence outside the U.S.. Our international business (and particularly our business in high-growth markets) is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in non-U.S. operations, any of which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn particular, after significant negotiation between the United Kingdom and the EU, the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit, took effect on January 31, 2020. There is now a transition period while the United Kingdom and EU negotiate additional arrangements, including their future trading terms. The United Kingdom has stated that it wants the transition period to expire, and the future trading terms to be agreed, by December 31, 2020. The withdrawal could, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services, and people between the United Kingdom and the EU, undermine bilateral cooperation in key policy areas, significantly disrupt trade between the United Kingdom and the EU, and lead to a period of considerable uncertainty in relation to global financial and banking markets. In addition, the withdrawal could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. If the United Kingdom and the EU are unable to negotiate acceptable future trading terms or if other EU member states pursue withdrawal, barrier-free access between the United Kingdom and other EU member states or among the EEA overall could be diminished or eliminated. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade, and legal implications the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU will have and how such withdrawal may affect us.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on the continued growth in the market for and the continued commercial demand for service delivery, service assurance and network security solutions focused on the performance monitoring and management of applications and networks.\nWe derive nearly all of our revenue from the sale of products and services that are designed to allow our customers to assure the delivery of services through management of the performance and network security of applications across IP networks. We have actively expanded our operations in the past through acquisitions and organic growth and may continue to expand them in the future in order to gain share in the evolving market in which we operate. Therefore, we must be able to predict the appropriate features and prices for future products to address the market, the optimal distribution strategy and the future changes to the competitive environment. In order for us to be successful, our potential customers must recognize the value of more sophisticated application management and network security solutions, decide to invest in the management of their networked applications and, in particular, adopt our management solutions. Any failure of this market to continue to be viable would materially and adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, businesses may choose to outsource the operations and management of their networks to managed service providers. Our business may depend on our ability to continue to develop relationships with these service providers and successfully market our products to them.\nChanges in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses and asset impairments.\nIn response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically reallocate managerial, operational, financial and other resources. Any such efforts may result in charges related to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products.\nOur growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services experience cyclicality.\nOur growth will depend in part on the growth of the markets which we serve. We serve certain industries that have historically been cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns that have had a material adverse impact on demand for the\nproducts, software and services that we offer. Any of these factors could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of the company in any given period.\nUncertain conditions in the global economy and constraints in the global credit market may adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nDisruptions in the global economy and constraints in the global credit market may cause some of our customers to reduce, delay, or cancel spending on capital and technology projects, resulting in reduced spending with us. While some industry sectors such as government and telecommunications may be less susceptible to the effects of an economic slowdown, our enterprise customers may be adversely affected, especially in financial services and consumer industries. Continued volatility in, or disruption of financial markets could limit customers' ability to obtain adequate financing to maintain operations and result in a decrease in sales volume that could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Further, competitors may respond to economic conditions by lowering their prices, which could put pressure on our pricing. We could also experience lower than anticipated order levels, cancellations of orders in backlog, defaults on outstanding accounts receivable and extended payment or delivery terms. Economic weakness, customer financial difficulties and constrained spending on IT initiatives have resulted, and may in the future result, in challenging and delayed sales cycles and could negatively impact our ability to forecast future periods. In addition, some of the markets we serve are emerging and the purchase of our products involves material changes to established purchasing patterns and policies. The purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources.\nOur stock price has been subject to fluctuations, and will likely continue to be subject to fluctuations, which may be volatile and due to factors beyond our control.\nThe market price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors discussed in this \"Risk Factors\" section and elsewhere in this report, factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our company, changes in financial estimates and publication of other news by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022ratings changes by any securities analysts who follow our company;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u2022changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n\u2022price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\n\u2022actual or anticipated developments in our business or our competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n\u2022developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or our products and platform capabilities, or third-party proprietary rights;\n\u2022cybersecurity attacks or incidents;\n\u2022announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;\n\u2022new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws, or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022changes in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022announced or completed equity or debt transactions involving our securities;\n\u2022sales of shares of our common stock by us, our officers, directors, or other stockholders;\n\u2022lawsuits filed or threatened against us; and\n\u2022other events or factors, including those resulting from public health crises (including global pandemics such as COVID-19, war, incidents of terrorism, or responses to these events).\nIn addition, the market for technology stocks and the stock markets in general have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation\nfollowing periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. A decline in the value of our common stock, including as a result of one or more factors set forth above, may result in substantial losses for our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 87179, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "NTCT"}
