The Company's business and ownership of shares of our common stock are subject to numerous risks. You should not purchase our shares if you cannot afford to lose your entire investment. You should consider the following risks before acquiring any of our shares.\nWe have never been, and may never be, profitable.\nDuring the past several years, we have attempted, without success, to generate revenues and profits. For the year ended March 31, 2017, we incurred a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $472,718. The net loss was primarily due to the impairment of our oil and gas assets. There can be no assurance that we will ever be profitable from our operations.\nWe need additional capital.\nWe need additional financing to continue operations. The amount required depends upon our business operations, and the capital needs to develop and market our CBD skincare products. We may be unable to secure this additional required financing on a timely basis, under terms acceptable to us, or at all. To obtain additional financing, we will likely sell additional equity securities, which will further dilute shareholders' ownership in us. Ultimately, if we do not raise the required capital, we may need to cease operations.\nWe are dependent upon our key personnel.\nWe are highly dependent upon the services of Kent A. Rodriguez, our President and Chief Executive Officer. If he terminated his services with us, our business would suffer.\nThere is only a limited trading market for our securities.\nOur Common Stock is traded on the OTC Pink Sheets. The prices quoted may not reflect the price at which you can resell your shares. Because of the low price of our stock, we are subject to particular rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that make it difficult for stock brokers to solicit customers to purchase our stock. This reduces the number of potential buyers of our stock and may reduce the value of your shares. There can be no assurance that a trading market for our stock will continue or that you will ever be able to resell your shares at a profit, or at all.\nOur management controls us.\nOur current officers and directors own approximately 43% of our outstanding stock and are able to affect the election of the members of our Board of Directors and make corporate decisions. Mr. Rodriguez, by his ownership of Class A Preferred Stock, has the right to vote 40% of our voting securities. On January 12, 2018, our Board of Directors agreed to amend Designation of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock be amended by changing the ratio for conversion, in Article IV, subparagraph (a), from .4% to .51% so that upon conversion the number of shares of common stock to be exchanged shall equal 51% of then issued and outstanding common stock. Accordingly, even if we issue additional shares to third parties, Mr. Rodriguez will continue to control at least 40% of our voting securities. This voting concentration may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our management or control or otherwise discourage potential acquirers from attempting to gain control of us. If potential acquirers are deterred, you may lose an opportunity to profit from a possible acquisition. See \"Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters\" and \"Market for Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters\".\nA significant number of shares are eligible for public sale, potentially depressing our stock price. Under the SEC's Rule 144, shares issued in issuances which are not registered with the SEC generally first become eligible for public resale after six months. Shareholders who are affiliates of us generally may resell only a limited number of their privately acquired shares after six months. After six months, stockholders who are not affiliated with us may resell any number of their privately acquired shares pursuant to Rule 144. The resale of the shares we have privately issued, or the potential for their future public resale, may depress our stock price.\nOur governing documents and Nevada law may discourage the potential acquisitions of our business. Our Board of Directors may issue additional shares of capital stock and establish their rights, preferences and classes, in most cases without stockholder approval. In addition, we may become subject to anti-takeover provisions found in Section 89.378-78.379 of the Nevada Business Corporation Act which may deter changes in control of our management which have not been approved by our Board of Directors.\nWe have going concern issue.\nThe Company has minimal revenues from our remaining oil and gas assets. We are in need of additional cash resources to maintain our operations. We have not yet received any revenue from the sale our CBD skincare products. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to raise additional capital or obtain necessary debt financing. The Company is presently dependent on its controlling shareholder to provide us funding for its daily operation and expenses, including professional fees and fees charged by regulators, although he is under no obligation to do so.\nThe Company intends to meet the cash requirements for the next 12 months from the issuance date of this report through a combination of debt and equity financing by way of private placements, friends, family and business associates. The Company currently does not have any arrangements in place to complete any private placement financings and there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in completing any such financings on terms that will be acceptable to it.\nIf we do not have sufficient working capital to pay our operating costs for the next 12 months, we will require additional funds to pay our legal, accounting and other fees associated with our Company and our filing obligations under United States federal securities laws, as well as to pay our other accounts payable generated in the ordinary course of our business. Once these costs are accounted for, we will focus on the following the manufacture and sale of our CBD skincare products.\nAny failure to raise money will have the effect of delaying the timeframes in the business plan as set forth above, and the Company may have to push back the dates of such activities.\nWe have material weaknesses on internal control.\nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under COSO Framework 2013 as of March 31, 2017 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of March 31, 2017, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. The material weaknesses identified related to (i) lack of segregation of duties due to a lack of accounting staff and resources with appropriate knowledge of U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting and compliance requirements; (ii) a lack of sufficient documented financial closing policies and procedures; and (iii) a lack of independent directors and an audit committee.", "PERMNO": 80366, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "GRVE"}
