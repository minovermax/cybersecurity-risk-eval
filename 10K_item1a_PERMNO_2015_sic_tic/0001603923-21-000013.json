{"cik": "1603923", "company": "Weatherford International plc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves various risks. You should consider carefully all the risk factors described below, the matters discussed herein under \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d and other information included and incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the SEC. If any of the risks described below, or elsewhere in this Form 10-K, were to materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline and investors could lose part or all of their investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOilfield Services Industry Risks\nOur business is dependent on capital spending by our customers which is greatly affected by fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices and the availability and cost of capital; reductions in capital spending by our customers has had, and could continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDemand for our services and products is tied to the level of exploration, development and production activity and the corresponding capital and operating spending by oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, including national oil companies. The level of exploration, development and production activity is directly affected by fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices, which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future, especially given current geopolitical and economic conditions. Sustained low oil and natural gas prices and declining global demand for oil and natural gas, including reduced demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, have led to our customers, including large oil and gas exploration and production companies, to greatly reduce planned future capital expenditures. Factors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include, but are not limited to: (1) the level of supply and demand for oil and natural gas; (2) the ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the expanded alliance collectively known as OPEC+ to set and maintain oil production levels; (3) the level of oil and natural gas production in the U.S. and by other non-OPEC+ countries; (4) oil refining capacity and shifts in end-customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas; (5) the cost of, and constraints associated with, producing and delivering oil and natural gas; (6) governmental regulations, including the policies of governments regarding the exploration for and production and development of their oil and natural gas reserves; (7) weather conditions, natural disasters, and health or similar issues, such as pandemics or epidemics; (8) worldwide political, military, and economic conditions; and (9) increased demand for alternative energy and electric vehicles, including government initiatives to promote the use of renewable energy sources and public sentiment around alternatives to oil and gas.\nIn addition, low commodity prices, the short-term tenor of most of our contracts and the financial stress experienced by some of our customers have combined to increase the demands by many of our customers for reductions in the prices we receive for our products and services. Further reductions in capital spending or requests for further cost reductions by our customers could directly impact our business by reducing demand and pricing for our services and products which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Spending by exploration and production companies can also be impacted by conditions in the capital markets, which have been volatile in recent years. Limitations on the availability of capital or higher costs of capital may cause exploration and production companies to make additional reductions to capital budgets even if oil and natural gas prices increase from current levels. Any such cuts in spending would curtail drilling programs, as well as discretionary spending on well services, which may result in a reduction in the demand for our services, the rates we can charge and the utilization of our assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nClimate change, environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) and \u201csustainability\u201d initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures, reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business, results of operations, stock price or access to capital markets.\nClimate change, ESG and sustainability are a growing global movement. Continuing political and social attention to these issues has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures, as well as society pressure in some areas, to limit greenhouse gas emissions and has been stated in the U.S. to be a priority of the new Biden Administration, as well as other initiatives. These agreements and measures, including the Paris Climate Accord, may require, or could result in future legislation and regulatory measures that require, significant equipment modifications, operational changes, taxes, or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations, which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. As a result of heightened public awareness and attention to these issues as well as continued regulatory initiatives to reduce the\nWeatherford International plc - 2020 Form 10-K | 10\nTable of Contents Item 1A | Risk Factors\nuse of oil and gas, demand hydrocarbons may be reduced, which would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The imposition and enforcement of stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction requirements could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and therefore significantly reduce the value of our business.\nCertain financial institutions, institutional investors and other sources of capital have begun to limit or eliminate their investment in oil and gas activities due to concerns about climate change, which could make it more difficult to finance our business. Increasing attention to climate change, ESG and sustainability has resulted in governmental investigations, and public and private litigation, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nIn addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward us and our industry and to the diversion of investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and costs of capital.\nSevere weather, including extreme weather conditions associated with global climate change, has in the past and could in the future adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business has been, and in the future will be, affected by severe weather in areas where we operate, which could materially affect our operations and financial results. In addition, impacts of climate change could increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions. Any such extreme weather-related events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiability claims resulting from catastrophic incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations\nDrilling for and producing hydrocarbons, and the associated products and services that we provide, include inherent dangers that may lead to property damage, personal injury, death or the discharge of hazardous materials into the environment. Many of these events are outside our control. Typically, we provide products and services at a well site where our personnel and equipment are located together with personnel and equipment of our customer and third parties, such as other service providers. At many sites, we depend on other companies and personnel to conduct drilling and other operations in accordance with appropriate safety standards. From time to time, personnel are injured or equipment or property is damaged or destroyed, as a result of accidents, failed equipment, faulty products or services, failure of safety measures, uncontained formation pressures or other dangers inherent in drilling for oil and natural gas. Any of these events can be the result of human error. With increasing frequency, our products and services are deployed on more challenging prospects both onshore and offshore, where the occurrence of the types of events mentioned above can have an even more catastrophic impact on people, equipment and the environment. Such events may expose us to significant potential losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly weakened demand for our products and services, and has had a substantial negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including actions taken by businesses and governments to contain the spread of the virus, have resulted in a significant and swift reduction in international and U.S. economic activity. These effects materially adversely affected the demand for oil and natural gas, as well as for our services and products. The collapse in the demand for oil in March 2020 caused in large part by this unprecedented global health and economic crisis, and the corresponding decline in our customers\u2019 demand for our services and products has had a substantial negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in 2020.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic impacts severely impacted our business and our industry. These effects included, and may continue to include, adverse revenue and net income effects; disruptions to our operations; customer shutdowns of oil and gas exploration and production; employee impacts from illness, school closures and other community response measures; and temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers and suppliers.\nWeatherford International plc - 2020 Form 10-K | 11\nTable of Contents Item 1A | Risk Factors\nThe extent to which our operating and financial results are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on various factors and consequences beyond our control, such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; additional actions by businesses and governments in response to the pandemic; and the speed and effectiveness of responses to combat the virus, including vaccine development and distribution. The COVID-19 pandemic, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, exacerbated, and could continue to exacerbate, the potential negative impact from many of our risk factors. The COVID-19 pandemic may also have a considerable and detrimental effect on our operating and financial results in a manner that is not currently known to us or that we do not currently consider as significant risks to our operations.\nGiven the nature and significance of the events described above, we are not able to enumerate all potential risks to our business; however, we believe that in addition to the impacts described above, other current and potential impacts of these recent events include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022Structural shift in the global economy and its demand for oil and natural gas as a result of changes in the way people work, travel and interact, or in connection with a global recession or depression;\n\u2022Reduction of our global workforce to adjust to market conditions, including severance payments, retention issues, and an inability to hire employees when market conditions improve;\n\u2022Infections and quarantining of our employees and the personnel of our customers, suppliers and other third parties in areas in which we operate;\n\u2022Our insurance policies may not cover losses associated with pandemics like COVID-19 or similar global health threats;\n\u2022Litigation risk and possible loss contingencies related to COVID-19 and its impact, including with respect to commercial contracts, employment matters, personal injury and insurance arrangements; and\n\u2022Cybersecurity issues, as digital technologies may become more vulnerable and experience a higher rate of cyberattacks in the current environment of remote connectivity due to stay-at-home orders.\nGiven the dynamic nature of these events, we cannot reasonably estimate the period of time that the COVID-19 pandemic and related market conditions will persist, the full extent of the impact they will have on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows or the pace or extent of any subsequent recovery.\nOur operational and financial growth is dependent on our liquidity requirements and the adequacy of our capital resources.\nOur liquidity, including our ability to meet our ongoing operational obligations, is dependent upon, among other things: (i) our ability to maintain adequate cash on hand; (ii) our ability to generate cash flow from operations; (iii) and changes in market conditions that negatively impact our revenue.\nThe energy industry faces negative sentiment in the capital markets which has impacted the ability of participants to access appropriate amounts of capital under suitable terms. This negative sentiment in the energy industry has not only impacted our customers in North America, it is also affecting the availability and the pricing for most credit lines extended to participants in the industry.\nWe utilize letters of credit and performance and bid bonds to provide credit support to our customers. If the beneficiaries were to call the letters of credit issued under our committed and or uncommitted facilities, our available cash balance may be reduced by the amount called and it could have an adverse impact on our business, operations, and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $338 million of letters of credit outstanding, consisting of $167 million under the LC Credit Agreement and $171 million under various uncommitted facilities (of which there was $164 million in cash collateral held and recorded in \u201cRestricted Cash\u201d on the Consolidated Balance Sheets). In Latin America we utilize surety bonds as part of our customary business practice. As of December 31, 2020, we had surety bonds outstanding of $326 million, primarily in Latin America. Any of our outstanding letters of credit or surety bonds could be called by the beneficiaries should we breach certain contractual or performance obligations. If the beneficiaries were to call the letters of credit under the LC Credit Agreement or the surety bonds, our available liquidity would be reduced by the amount called.\nWeatherford International plc - 2020 Form 10-K | 12\nTable of Contents Item 1A | Risk Factors\nWe may not be fully indemnified against financial losses in all circumstances where damage to or loss of property, personal injury, death or environmental harm occur.\nAs is customary in our industry, our contracts typically require that our customers indemnify us for claims arising from the injury or death of their employees (and those of their other contractors), the loss or damage of their equipment (and that of their other contractors), damage to the well or reservoir and pollution originating from the customer\u2019s equipment or from the reservoir (including uncontained oil flow from a reservoir) and claims arising from catastrophic events, such as a well blowout, fire, explosion and from pollution below the surface. Conversely, we typically indemnify our customers for claims arising from the injury or death of our employees, the loss or damage of our equipment (other than equipment lost in the hole) or pollution originating from our equipment above the surface of the earth or water.\nOur indemnification arrangements may not protect us in every case. For example, our indemnity arrangements may be held to be overly broad in some courts and/or contrary to public policy in some jurisdictions, and to that extent may be unenforceable. Additionally, some jurisdictions which permit indemnification nonetheless limit its scope by applicable law, rule, order or statute. We may be subject to claims brought by third parties or government agencies with respect to which we are not indemnified. Furthermore, the parties from which we seek indemnity may not be solvent, may become bankrupt, may lack resources or insurance to honor their indemnities or may not otherwise be able to satisfy their indemnity obligations to us. The lack of enforceable indemnification could expose us to significant potential losses.\nFurther, our assets generally are not insured against loss from political violence such as war, terrorism or civil unrest. If any of our assets are damaged or destroyed as a result of an uninsured cause, we could recognize a loss of those assets.\nOur indebtedness and liabilities could limit cash flow available for our operations, expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to satisfy our financial obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $2.6 billion of long-term debt with $2.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 11.0% Senior Notes maturing on December 1, 2024 (\u201cExit Notes\u201d) and $500 million in aggregate principal amount of our 8.75% Senior Secured Notes maturing on September 1, 2024 (\u201cSenior Secured Notes\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of our Exit Notes and Senior Secured Notes, we expect to have interest payments of approximately $275 million annually until maturity. Our level of indebtedness has negative consequences for our business, financial condition and results of operations, including:\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing on terms that are commercially acceptable;\n\u2022requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing our free cash flow and the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business;\n\u2022placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors or competitors that may have better access to capital resources; and\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance if desired before maturity, our debt obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Lower commodity prices and in turn lower demand for our products and services have negatively impacted our revenues, earnings and cash flows, and sustained low oil and natural gas prices could have an adverse effect on our liquidity position. Any harm to our business and operations resulting from our current or future level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to pay amounts due to our lenders and noteholders.\nOur business may be exposed to uninsured claims and, as a result, litigation might result in significant potential losses. The cost of our insured risk management program may increase.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we become the subject of various claims and litigation. We maintain liability insurance, which includes insurance against damage to people, property and the environment, up to maximum limits of $350 million, subject to self-insured retentions and deductibles.\nWeatherford International plc - 2020 Form 10-K | 13\nTable of Contents Item 1A | Risk Factors\nOur insurance policies are subject to exclusions, limitations and other conditions and may not apply in all cases, for example where willful wrongdoing on our part is alleged. It is possible an unexpected judgment could be rendered against us in cases in which we could be uninsured and beyond the amounts we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring, and in some cases those potential losses could be material.\nOur insurance may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or our insurance may not cover all losses. For example, although we maintain product liability insurance, this type of insurance is limited in coverage and it is possible an adverse claim could arise in excess of our coverage. Additionally, insurance rates have in the past been subject to wide fluctuation and may be unavailable on terms that we or our customers believe are economically acceptable. Reductions in coverage, changes in the insurance markets and accidents affecting our industry may result in further increases in our cost and higher deductibles and retentions in future years and may also result in reduced activity levels in certain markets. As a result, we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms. Any of these events could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from our operations outside the United States, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the over 75 countries in which we operate.\nOur non-United States operations accounted for 80% of our consolidated revenue in 2020. Operations in countries other than the United States are subject to various risks, including:\n\u2022volatility in political, social and economic conditions including currency exchange controls, inflation, and currency exchange rate fluctuations and devaluations;\n\u2022exposure to expropriation of our assets, deprivation of contract rights or other governmental actions;\n\u2022social unrest, acts of terrorism, war or other armed conflict;\n\u2022varying international laws and regulations;\n\u2022confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies;\n\u2022trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the European Union, the United States or other countries;\n\u2022exposure under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) or similar legislation; and\n\u2022restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital.\nOur actual financial results after emergence from bankruptcy are not comparable to our historical financial information as a result of the implementation of the Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby and the implementation of fresh start accounting.\nUpon our emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted fresh start accounting and adjusted our assets and liabilities to fair values and our accumulated deficit was restated to zero as of December 13, 2019, which resulted in the Company becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations following our emergence from bankruptcy will not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in our pre-December 13, 2019 historical financial statements. Implementation of the Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby materially changed the amounts and classifications reported in our consolidated historical financial statements. The lack of recent comparable historical financial information may discourage investors from purchasing our ordinary shares.\nThere may be circumstances in which the interests of our significant shareholders could be in conflict with the interests of our other shareholders.\nIn the aggregate, certain funds associated with our largest eight shareholders currently own in excess of 80% of our outstanding ordinary shares. Circumstances may arise in which these shareholders may have an interest in pursuing or preventing acquisitions, divestitures or other transactions, including the issuance of additional equity or debt, that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment in us or another company in which they invest. Such transactions might adversely affect us or other holders of our ordinary shares. In addition, our significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our ordinary shares because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with significant shareholders.\nAn active trading market for our ordinary shares may not develop and the price and trading volume of our ordinary shares may fluctuate significantly.\nOur ordinary shares are listed for quotation on the OTC Pink Marketplace. We cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in us will lead to the development of an active trading market or how liquid that market might become. In addition, no\nWeatherford International plc - 2020 Form 10-K | 14\nTable of Contents Item 1A | Risk Factors\nassurances can be given regarding when, and if, we will resume our listing on a national exchange, including whether or not we will be able to meet applicable listing standards for any such exchange. If an active trading market does not develop, holders of our shares may have difficulty selling any of our ordinary shares that may now be owned or may be purchased later. In addition, until we are able resume our listing on a national exchange, the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our ordinary shares may be reduced, we may receive decreased news and analyst coverage and we may be limited in our ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nEven if an active trading market develops for our ordinary shares, the market price of our ordinary shares may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume of our ordinary shares may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Volatility in the market price of our ordinary shares may prevent one from being able to sell shares at or above the ordinary share issuance price or above the price one paid to acquire the ordinary shares.\nThe terms of our indebtedness restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to pursue our business strategies.\nThe LC Credit Agreement and the indentures governing our Exit Notes and Senior Secured Notes contain restrictive covenants that could impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that we may believe to be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022pay dividends and make other distributions;\n\u2022prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022make loans and investments; and\n\u2022sell assets and incur liens.\nThese covenants and other restrictions may limit our ability to effectively operate our business, and to execute our growth strategy or take advantage of new business opportunities. These covenants and restrictions include minimum liquidity covenants, certain financial ratios, which may apply in certain circumstances, and other restrictions. Our ability to meet the liquidity thresholds and those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control.\nA breach of the covenants and other restrictions under the LC Credit Agreement, the indentures governing our Senior Secured Notes and Exit Notes or our other indebtedness could result in an event of default thereunder. Such a default may allow the lenders, holders or the trustee, as applicable, to accelerate the related indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under LC Credit Agreements would permit the lenders thereunder to terminate all commitments.\nLegal, Tax and Regulatory Risks\nOur operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, treaties and international agreements related to greenhouse gases, climate change and alternate energy sources that may expose us to significant liabilities, result in additional compliance costs and could reduce our business opportunities and revenues.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations related to the energy industry specifically, and the environment in particular. In the case of environmental regulations, an environmental claim could arise with respect to one or more of our current businesses, products or services, or a business or property that one of our predecessors owned or used, and such claims could involve material expenditures. Generally, environmental laws have in recent years become more stringent and have sought to impose greater liability on a larger number of potentially responsible parties and have increased the costs associated with complying with the more stringent laws and regulations. The scope of regulation of our industry and our products and services may increase further, including possible increases in liabilities or funding requirements imposed by governmental agencies. Additional regulations on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere in the world could be imposed, and those regulations could limit our business where they are imposed.\nIn addition, members of the U.S. Congress, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and various agencies of several states within the U.S. frequently review, consider and propose more stringent regulation of hydraulic fracturing, a stimulation treatment routinely performed on oil and gas wells in low-permeability reservoirs. We previously provided (and may, in the future, resume providing) fracturing services to customers. Regulators are investigating whether any chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing\nWeatherford International plc - 2020 Form 10-K | 15\nTable of Contents Item 1A | Risk Factors\nprocess might adversely affect groundwater or whether the fracturing processes could lead to other unintended effects or damages. In recent years, local and national governments (including several cities and states within the U.S.) passed new laws and regulations concerning or banning hydraulic fracturing. A significant portion of North American service activity today is directed at prospects that require hydraulic fracturing in order to produce hydrocarbons. Therefore, additional regulation could increase the costs of conducting our business by subjecting fracturing to more stringent regulation. Regulation of hydraulic fracturing could increase our cost of providing services or materially reduce our business opportunities and revenues if customers decrease their levels of activity or we cannot pass along cost to customers. We are unable to predict whether changes in laws or regulations or any other governmental proposals or responses will ultimately occur, and accordingly, we are unable to assess the potential financial or operational impact they may have on our business.\nAdverse changes in tax laws both in the United States and abroad, changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws could significantly increase our tax expense and require us to take actions, at potential significant expense, to seek to preserve our current level of tax expense.\nIn 2002, we reorganized from the United States to a foreign jurisdiction. There are frequent legislative proposals in the United States that attempt to treat companies that have undertaken similar transactions as U.S. corporations subject to U.S. taxes or to limit the tax deductions or tax credits available to United States subsidiaries of these corporations. Our tax expense could be impacted by changes in tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable law by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other taxing jurisdictions, acting in unison or separately. The inability to reduce our tax expense could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d), which represents a coalition of member countries, issued various white papers addressing Tax Base Erosion and Jurisdictional Profit Shifting. The recommendations in these white papers are generally aimed at combating what they believe is tax avoidance. Numerous jurisdictions in which we operate have been influenced by these white papers as well as other factors and are increasingly active in evaluating changes to their tax laws.\nOur effective tax rate has fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future. Future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries in which we operate with differing tax rates, non-income-based taxes, changes in tax laws, or changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities. We assess our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine whether a valuation allowance may be required. We have recorded a valuation allowance on substantially all of our deferred tax assets.\nIf a United States person is treated as owning at least 10% of our shares, such holder may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences.\nAs a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\u201cTCJA\u201d), many of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are now classified as \u201ccontrolled foreign corporations\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes due to the expanded application of certain ownership attribution rules within a multinational corporate group. If a United States person is treated as owning (directly, indirectly or constructively) at least 10% of the value or voting power of our shares, such person may be treated as a \u201cUnited States shareholder\u201d with respect to one or more of our controlled foreign corporation subsidiaries. In addition, if our shares are treated as owned more than 50% by United States shareholders, we would be treated as a controlled foreign corporation. A United States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation may be required to annually report and include in its U.S. taxable income, as ordinary income, its pro rata share of \u201cSubpart F income,\u201d \u201cglobal intangible low-taxed income\u201d and investments in U.S. property by controlled foreign corporations, whether or not we make any distributions to such United States shareholder. An individual United States shareholder generally would not be allowed certain tax deductions or foreign tax credits that would be allowed to a corporate United States shareholder with respect to a controlled foreign corporation. A failure by a United States shareholder to comply with its reporting obligations may subject the United States shareholder to significant monetary penalties and may extend the statute of limitations with respect to the United States shareholder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax return for the year for which such reporting was due. We cannot provide any assurances that we will assist investors in determining whether we or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are controlled foreign corporations or whether any investor is a United States shareholder with respect to any such controlled foreign corporations. We also cannot guarantee that we will furnish to United States shareholders information that may be necessary for them to comply with the aforementioned obligations. United States investors should consult their own advisors regarding the potential application of these rules to their investments in us. The risk of being subject to increased taxation\nWeatherford International plc - 2020 Form 10-K | 16\nTable of Contents Item 1A | Risk Factors\nmay deter our current shareholders from increasing their investment in us and others from investing in us, which could impact the demand for, and value of, our shares.\nThe United States could treat Weatherford International PLC (parent corporation) as a US taxpayer under IRC Section 7874.\nFollowing the emergence from bankruptcy on December 13, 2019, Weatherford continues to operate under Weatherford International PLC (PLC), an Irish tax resident. The IRS may, however, assert that PLC should be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to IRC Section 7874. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a corporation generally is classified as either a U.S. corporation or a foreign corporation by reference to the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation. Because PLC is an Irish incorporated entity, it would generally be classified as a foreign corporation under these rules. IRC Section 7874 provides an exception to this general rule under which a foreign incorporated entity may, in certain circumstances, be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under IRC Section 7874, a corporation created or organized outside the United States (i.e., a foreign corporation) will nevertheless be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes when (i) the foreign corporation directly or indirectly acquires substantially all of the assets held directly or indirectly by a U.S. corporation (including the indirect acquisition of assets of the U.S. corporation by acquiring the outstanding shares of the U.S. corporation), (ii) the shareholders of the acquired U.S. corporation hold, by vote or value, at least 80% (or 60% in certain circumstances if the Third Country Rule applies) of the shares of the foreign acquiring corporation after the acquisition by reason of holding shares in the U.S. acquired corporation (the \u201cSection 7874 Percentage\u201d), and (iii) the foreign corporation\u2019s \u201cexpanded affiliated group\u201d does not have substantial business activities in the foreign corporation\u2019s country of organization or incorporation relative to such expanded affiliated group\u2019s worldwide activities. Although it is not free from doubt, we believe that as a result of the implementation of the plan of reorganization in 2019, PLC should not be treated as acquiring directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a U.S. corporation and, as a result, PLC is not expected to be treated as a U.S. corporation or otherwise subject to the adverse tax consequences of IRC Section 7874. The law and the Treasury Regulations promulgated under IRC Section 7874 are, however, unclear and there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with this conclusion. If it is determined that IRC Section 7874 is applicable, PLC would be a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the taxable year of Weatherford US consolidated group could end on or prior to the emergence from bankruptcy, which could result in additional adverse tax consequences. In addition, although PLC would be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would generally also be considered an Irish tax resident for Irish tax and other non-U.S. tax purposes.\nThe rights of our shareholders are governed by Irish law; Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.\nAs an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Act, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, provisions relating to interested directors, mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.\nWe are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States.\nWe are organized under the laws of Ireland, and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States. The United States currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. As such, a shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in Ireland. In addition, there is some doubt as to whether the courts of Ireland and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. The laws of Ireland do, however, as a general rule, provide that the judgments of the courts of the United States have the same validity in Ireland as if rendered by Irish Courts. Certain important requirements must be satisfied before the Irish Courts will recognize the U.S. judgment. The originating court must have been a court of competent jurisdiction, the judgment must be final and conclusive, and the judgment may not be recognized if it was obtained by fraud or its recognition would be contrary to Irish public policy. Any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice or that is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment would not be enforced in Ireland.\nWeatherford International plc - 2020 Form 10-K | 17\nTable of Contents Item 1A | Risk Factors\nSimilarly, judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the United States where we have assets.\nGeneral Risks\nIf our long-lived assets and other assets are impaired, we may be required to record significant non-cash charges to our earnings.\nWe recognize impairments of long-lived assets when we determine the carrying amount of certain long-lived asset groups exceed their respective fair values. Our impairment assessment includes analysis of the undiscounted cash flow of our asset groups, which include property, plant and equipment, definite-lived intangible assets, and right of use assets. Based on the uncertainty of forecasted revenue, forecasted operating margins, and discount rate assumptions used to estimate our asset groups\u2019 fair value, future reductions in our expected cash flows could cause a material non-cash impairment charge of long-lived assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business could be negatively affected by cybersecurity incidents and other technology disruptions.\nWe rely heavily on information systems to conduct and protect our business. These information systems are increasingly subject to sophisticated cybersecurity incidents such as unauthorized access to data and systems, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer, supplier and employee information), computer viruses, or other malicious code, phishing and cyberattacks, and other similar events. These incidents arise from numerous sources, not all of which are within our control, including fraud or malice on the part of third parties, accidental technological failure, electrical or telecommunication outages, failures of computer servers or other damage to our property or assets, human error, complications encountered as existing systems are maintained, repaired, replaced, or upgraded or outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts.\nGiven the rapidly evolving nature of cybersecurity incidents, there can be no assurance that the systems we have designed and implemented to prevent or limit the effects of cybersecurity incidents or attacks will be sufficient in preventing all such incidents or attacks, or be able to avoid a material impact to our systems should such incidents or attacks occur. A cybersecurity incident or attack, could result in the disclosure of confidential or proprietary customer, supplier or employee information, theft or loss of intellectual property, damage to our reputation with our customers, suppliers and the market, failure to meet customer requirements or customer dissatisfaction, theft or exposure to litigation, damage to equipment (which could cause environmental or safety issues) and other financial costs and losses. Moreover, although Weatherford implements stringent controls on third party connectivity to our systems, we have limited control in ensuring their systems consistently enforce strong cybersecurity controls. As a result, the occurrence of a cybersecurity incident or attack could go unnoticed for a period time. As cybersecurity incidents and attacks continue to evolve, we may also be required to devote additional resources to continue to enhance our protective measures or to investigate or remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Beginning in 2021, we maintain insurance coverage to protect against certain cybersecurity risks. However, we cannot ensure that it will be sufficient to cover any particular losses we may experience as a result of such cybersecurity incident or attack. Any cybersecurity incident or attack could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 32791, "SIC": 1381, "TIC": "WFTLF"}
