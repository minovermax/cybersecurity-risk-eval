An extended decline in the prices of oil and natural gas would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, ability to meet our financial obligations and results of operations.\nOur future financial condition, revenues, results of operations, profitability and future growth, and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend primarily on the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production. Our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity and to obtain additional capital on attractive terms also substantially depends upon oil and natural gas prices. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile and oil prices have been significantly depressed since the end of 2014. For example, for the five years ended December 31, 2014, the NYMEX-WTI oil price ranged from a high of $113.93 per Bbl to a low of $53.27 per Bbl, while the NYMEX-Henry Hub natural gas price ranged from a high of $6.15 per MMBtu to a low of $1.91 per MMBtu. These markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we will receive for our production, and the levels of our production, will depend on numerous factors beyond our control.\nThese factors include:\n\u2022\nrelatively minor changes in the supply of or the demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe condition of the United States and worldwide economies;\n\u2022\nmarket uncertainty;\n\u2022\nthe level of consumer product demand;\n\u2022\nweather conditions in the United States, such as hurricanes;\n\u2022\nthe actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulation and taxes, including price controls adopted by the FERC;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions or hostilities in oil and natural gas producing regions, including the Middle East and South America;\n\u2022\nthe price and level of foreign imports of oil and natural gas; and\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternate fuel sources.\nWe cannot predict future oil and natural gas prices and such prices may decline. An extended decline in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to meet our financial obligations and results of operations. Lower prices have reduced and may further reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically and has required and may require us to record additional ceiling test write-downs and may cause our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2015 to decline compared to our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2014. Substantially all of our oil and natural gas sales are made in the spot market or pursuant to contracts based on spot market prices. Our sales are not made pursuant to long-term fixed price contracts.\nTo attempt to reduce our price risk, we periodically enter into hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our expected future production. We cannot assure you that such transactions will reduce the risk or minimize the effect of any decline in oil or natural gas prices. Any substantial or extended decline in the prices of or demand for oil or natural gas would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, ability to meet our financial obligations and results of operations.\nOur outstanding indebtedness may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business, which in turn may limit our ability to remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt.\nThe aggregate principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness, net of cash on hand, as of December 31, 2014 was $407 million. We have $95 million of additional availability under our bank credit facility, subject, however, to limitations on incurrence of indebtedness under the indenture governing our 10% Senior Notes due 2017 (the \"10% senior notes\"). In addition, we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. Specifically, our high level of debt could have important consequences for you, including the following:\n\u2022\nit may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness, including our 10% senior notes, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt agreements, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness;\n\u2022\nthe covenants contained in our debt agreements limit our ability to borrow money in the future for acquisitions, capital expenditures or to meet our operating expenses or other general corporate obligations and may limit our flexibility in operating our business;\n\u2022\nwe will need to use a substantial portion of our cash flows to pay interest on our debt, approximately $35 million per year for interest on our 10% senior notes alone, and to pay quarterly dividends, if declared by our Board of Directors, on our 6.875% Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (the \"Series B Preferred Stock\") of approximately $5.1 million per year, which will reduce the amount of money we have for operations, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other business activities;\n\u2022\nthe amount of our interest expense may increase because certain of our borrowings in the future may be at variable rates of interest, which, if interest rates increase, could result in higher interest expense;\n\u2022\nwe may have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our industry or the economy in general, especially extended or further declines in oil and natural gas prices; and\n\u2022\nour debt level could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate.\nOur ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulation. We cannot be certain that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt, including our 10% senior notes, and meet our other obligations. If we do not have enough cash to service our debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, including our 10% senior notes, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity. We may not be able to refinance our debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt obligations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including our 10% senior notes, and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future. To a certain extent, this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory conditions and other factors that are beyond our control, including the prices that we receive for our oil and natural gas production.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our bank credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness, including our 10% senior notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations, we may be forced to reduce our planned capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional equity or debt capital or restructure our debt. We cannot assure you that any of these remedies could, if necessary, be affected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms. Our cash flow and capital resources may be insufficient for payment of interest on and principal of our debt in the future, including payments on our 10% senior notes, and any such alternative measures may be unsuccessful or may not permit us to meet scheduled debt service obligations, which could cause us to default on our obligations and could impair our liquidity.\nA financial downturn or negative credit market conditions may have lasting effects on our liquidity, business and financial condition that we cannot predict.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. Our liquidity could be substantially negatively affected by an inability to obtain capital in the long-term or short-term debt capital markets or equity capital markets or an inability to access bank financing. A prolonged credit crisis or turmoil in the domestic or global financial systems could materially affect our liquidity, business and financial condition. These conditions have adversely impacted financial markets previously and created substantial volatility and uncertainty, and could do so again, with the related negative impact on global economic activity and the financial markets. Negative credit market conditions could materially affect our liquidity and may inhibit our lenders from fully funding our bank credit facility or cause them to make the terms of our bank credit facility costlier and more restrictive. A weak economic environment could also adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables or performance by our suppliers and cause our commodity derivative arrangements to be ineffective if our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations or seek bankruptcy protection. Additionally, negative economic conditions could lead to reduced demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs or lower prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs, which could have a negative impact on our revenues.\nWe may not be able to obtain adequate financing when the need arises to execute our long-term operating strategy.\nOur ability to execute our long-term operating strategy is highly dependent on having access to capital when the need arises. We historically have addressed our long-term liquidity needs through bank credit facilities, second lien term credit facilities, issuances of equity and debt securities, sales of assets, joint ventures and cash provided by operating activities. We will examine the following alternative sources of long-term capital as dictated by current economic conditions:\n\u2022\nborrowings from banks or other lenders;\n\u2022\nthe sale of certain assets;\n\u2022\nthe issuance of debt securities;\n\u2022\nthe sale of common stock, preferred stock or other equity securities;\n\u2022\njoint venture financing; and\n\u2022\nproduction payments.\nThe availability of these sources of capital when the need arises will depend upon a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include general economic and financial market conditions, oil and natural gas prices, our credit ratings, interest rates, market perceptions of us or the oil and gas industry, our market value and our operating performance. We may be unable to execute our long-term operating strategy if we cannot obtain capital from these sources when the need arises.\nThe borrowing base under our bank credit facility may be reduced below the amount of borrowings outstanding under such facility.\nUnder the terms of our bank credit facility, our borrowing base is subject to redeterminations at least semi-annually based in part on prevailing oil and gas prices. A negative adjustment could occur if the estimates of future prices used by the banks in calculating the borrowing base are significantly lower than those used in the last redetermination. The next redetermination of our borrowing base is scheduled to occur by March 31, 2015. In addition, the portion of our borrowing base made available to us is subject to the terms and covenants of the bank credit facility including, without limitation, compliance with the ratios and other financial covenants of such facility. In the event the amount outstanding under our bank credit facility exceeds the redetermined borrowing base, we could be forced to repay a portion of our borrowings. We may not have sufficient funds to make any required repayment. If we do not have sufficient funds and are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing, we may have to sell a portion of our assets.\nRestrictive debt covenants could limit our growth and our ability to finance our operations, fund our capital needs, respond to changing conditions and engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests.\nOur bank credit facility and the indenture governing our 10% senior notes contain a number of significant covenants that, among other things, restrict or limit our ability to:\n\u2022\npay dividends or distributions on our capital stock or issue preferred stock;\n\u2022\nrepurchase, redeem or retire our capital stock or subordinated debt;\n\u2022\nmake certain loans and investments;\n\u2022\nplace restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to make distributions;\n\u2022\nsell assets, including the capital stock of subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\ncreate or assume certain liens on our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nmerge or to enter into other business combination transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions that would result in a change of control of us; or\n\u2022\nengage in other corporate activities.\nAlso, our bank credit facility and the indenture governing our 10% senior notes require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests. Our ability to comply with these ratios and financial condition tests may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet these ratios and financial condition tests. These financial ratio restrictions and financial condition tests could limit our ability to obtain future financings, make needed capital expenditures, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations that the restrictive covenants under our bank credit facility and the indenture governing our 10% senior notes impose on us.\nA breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios or financial condition tests could result in a default under our bank credit facility and our 10% senior notes. A default, if not cured or waived, could result in all indebtedness outstanding under our bank credit facility and our 10% senior notes to become immediately due and payable. If that should occur, we may not be able to pay all such debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if new financing were then available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could accelerate the maturity of the debt or proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure such defaulted debt.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to find, develop, produce and acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable.\nAs is generally the case in the Gulf Coast Basin where approximately 38% of our current production is located, many of our producing properties are characterized by a high initial production rate, followed by a steep decline in production. In order to maintain or increase our reserves, we must constantly locate and develop or acquire new oil and natural gas reserves to replace those being depleted by production. We must do this even during periods of low oil and natural gas prices when it is difficult to raise the capital necessary to finance our exploration, development and acquisition activities. Without successful exploration, development or acquisition activities, our reserves and revenues will decline rapidly. We may not be able to find and develop or acquire additional reserves at an acceptable cost or have access to necessary financing for these activities, either of which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nApproximately 38% of our production is exposed to the additional risk of severe weather, including hurricanes and tropical storms, as well as flooding, coastal erosion and sea level rise.\nAt December 31, 2014, approximately 38% of our production and approximately 14% of our estimated proved reserves are located in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Gulf Coast Basin. Operations in this area are subject to severe weather, including hurricanes and tropical storms, as well as flooding, coastal erosion and sea level rise. Some of these adverse conditions can be severe enough to cause substantial damage to facilities and possibly interrupt production. For example, certain of our Gulf Coast Basin properties have experienced damages and production downtime as a result of storms including Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and more recently Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. In addition, according to certain scientific studies, emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and other gases commonly known as greenhouse gases may be contributing to global warming of the earth's atmosphere and to global climate change, which may exacerbate the severity of these adverse conditions. As a result, such conditions may pose increased climate-related risks to our assets and operations.\nIn accordance with customary industry practices, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks; however, losses could occur for uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable or that any particular types of coverage will be available. An event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nSEC rules could limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves or require us to write down our proved undeveloped reserves.\nSEC rules require that, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking. This requirement may limit our potential to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program. Moreover, we may be required to write down our proved undeveloped reserves if we do not drill on those reserves within the required five-year time frame.\nOur actual production, revenues and expenditures related to our reserves are likely to differ from our estimates of proved reserves. We may experience production that is less than estimated and drilling costs that are greater than estimated in our reserve report. These differences may be material.\nAlthough the estimates of our oil and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows attributable to those reserves were prepared by Ryder Scott Company, L.P., our independent petroleum and geological engineers, we are ultimately responsible for the disclosure of those estimates. Reserve engineering is a complex and subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, including:\n\u2022\nhistorical production from the area compared with production from other similar producing wells;\n\u2022\nthe assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies;\n\u2022\nassumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices; and\n\u2022\nassumptions concerning future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and work-over and remedial costs.\nBecause all reserve estimates are to some degree subjective, each of the following items may differ materially from those assumed in estimating proved reserves:\n\u2022\nthe quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered;\n\u2022\nthe production and operating costs incurred;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of future development expenditures; and\n\u2022\nfuture oil and natural gas sales prices.\nFurthermore, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data. Historically, the difference between our actual production and the production estimated in a prior year's reserve report has not been material. Our 2014 production, excluding the impact from successful exploration wells which are not included in the prior year reserve report, was approximately 14% lower than amounts projected in our 2013 reserve report. We cannot assure you that these differences will not be material in the future.\nApproximately 40% of our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2014 are undeveloped and 6% were developed, non-producing. Recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. The reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop and produce our reserves. Although we have prepared estimates of our oil and natural gas reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards, we cannot assure you that the estimated costs are accurate, that development will occur as scheduled or that the actual results will be as estimated. In addition, the recovery of certain developed non-producing reserves (primarily in the Gulf of Mexico) is generally subject to the approval of development plans and related activities by applicable state and/or federal agencies. Statutes and regulations may affect both the timing and quantity of recovery of estimated reserves. Such statutes and regulations, and their enforcement, have changed in the past and may change in the future, and may result in upward or downward revisions to current estimated proved reserves.\nYou should not assume that the standardized measure of discounted cash flows is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the standardized measure of discounted cash flows from proved reserves at December 31, 2014 are based on twelve-month average prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. These prices and costs will change and may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. Any changes in consumption by oil and natural gas purchasers or in governmental regulations or taxation may also affect actual future net cash flows. The actual timing of development activities, including related production and expenses, will affect the timing of future net cash flows and any differences between estimated development timing and actual could have a material effect on standardized measure. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating standardized measure of discounted cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with accounting requirements is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor. The effective interest rate at various times and the risks associated with our operations or the oil and natural gas industry in general will affect the accuracy of the 10% discount factor.\nWe may be unable to successfully identify, execute or effectively integrate future acquisitions, which may negatively affect our results of operations.\nAcquisitions of oil and gas businesses and properties have been an important element of our business, and we will continue to pursue acquisitions in the future. In the last several years, we have pursued and consummated acquisitions that have provided us opportunities to grow our production and reserves. Although we regularly engage in discussions with, and submit proposals to, acquisition candidates, suitable acquisitions may not be available in the future on reasonable terms. If we do identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may be unable to successfully negotiate the terms of an acquisition, finance the acquisition or, if the acquisition occurs, effectively integrate the acquired business into our existing business. Negotiations of potential acquisitions and the integration of acquired business operations may require a disproportionate amount of management's attention and our resources. Even if we complete additional acquisitions, continued acquisition financing may not be available or available on reasonable terms, any new businesses may not generate revenues comparable to our existing business, the anticipated cost efficiencies or synergies may not be realized and these businesses may not be integrated successfully or operated profitably. The success of any acquisition will depend on a number of factors, including the ability to estimate accurately the recoverable volumes of reserves, rates of future production and future net revenues attainable from the reserves and to assess possible environmental liabilities. Our inability to successfully identify, execute or effectively integrate future acquisitions may negatively affect our results of operations.\nEven though we perform due diligence reviews (including a review of title and other records) of the major properties we seek to acquire that we believe is consistent with industry practices, these reviews are inherently incomplete. It is generally not feasible for us to perform an in-depth review of every individual property and all records involved in each acquisition. However, even an in-depth review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems or permit us to become familiar enough with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Even when problems are identified, we may assume certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with the acquired businesses and properties. The discovery of any material liabilities associated with our acquisitions could harm our results of operations.\nIn addition, acquisitions of businesses may require additional debt or equity financing, resulting in additional leverage or dilution of ownership. Our bank credit facility contains certain covenants that limit, or which may have the effect of limiting, among other things acquisitions, capital expenditures, the sale of assets and the incurrence of additional indebtedness.\nHedging production may limit potential gains from increases in commodity prices or result in losses.\nWe enter into hedging arrangements from time to time to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices and to achieve more predictable cash flow. Our hedges at December 31, 2014 are in the form of swaps placed with the commodity trading branches of JPMorgan Chase Bank, Wells Fargo Bank, Bank of America, The Bank of Nova Scotia and Capital One, N.A., all of which participate in our bank credit facility. We cannot assure you that these or future counterparties will not become credit risks in the future. Hedging arrangements expose us to risks in some circumstances, including situations when the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults on the contractual obligations or there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received. These hedging arrangements may limit the benefit we could receive from increases in the market or spot prices for oil and natural gas. Oil and natural gas hedges increased (decreased) our total oil and gas sales by approximately ($3.0) million, $0.9 million and $9.1 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We cannot assure you that the hedging transactions we have entered into, or will enter into, will adequately protect us from fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices.\nThe loss of key management or technical personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate.\nOur operations are dependent upon a diverse group of key senior management and technical personnel. In addition, we employ numerous other skilled technical personnel, including geologists, geophysicists and engineers that are essential to our operations. We cannot assure you that such individuals will remain with us for the immediate or foreseeable future. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of any of these key management or technical personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nLosses and liabilities from uninsured or underinsured drilling and operating activities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nWe maintain several types of insurance to cover our operations, including worker's compensation, maritime employer's liability and comprehensive general liability. Amounts over base coverages are provided by primary and excess umbrella liability policies. We also maintain operator's extra expense coverage, which covers the control of drilling or producing wells as well as redrilling expenses and pollution coverage for wells out of control.\nWe may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable, or we could experience losses that are not insured or that exceed the maximum limits under our insurance policies. If a significant event that is not fully insured or indemnified occurs, it could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nLower oil and natural gas prices may cause us to record ceiling test write-downs, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe use the full cost method of accounting to account for our oil and natural gas operations. Accordingly, we capitalize the cost to acquire, explore for and develop oil and natural gas properties. Under full cost accounting rules, the net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties may not exceed a \u201cfull cost ceiling\u201d which is based upon the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves, including the effect of hedges in place, discounted at 10%, plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties. If at the end of any fiscal period we determine that the net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties exceed the full cost ceiling, we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings in the period then ended. This is called a \u201cceiling test write-down.\u201d This charge does not impact cash flow from operating activities, but does reduce our net income and stockholders' equity. Once incurred, a write-down of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date.\nWe review the net capitalized costs of our properties quarterly, using a single price based on the beginning of the month average of oil and natural gas prices for the prior 12 months. We also assess investments in unproved properties periodically to determine whether impairment has occurred. The risk that we will be required to further write down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices are low or volatile. In addition, write-downs may occur if we experience\nsubstantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or our unproved property values, or if estimated future development costs increase. As a result of the decline in commodity prices, we recognized a ceiling test write-down totaling $137.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2012. While no such write-downs occurred during 2014 or 2013, we may experience further ceiling test write-downs or other impairments in the future. In addition, any future ceiling test cushion would be subject to fluctuation as a result of acquisition or divestiture activity.\nFactors beyond our control affect our ability to market oil and natural gas.\nThe availability of markets and the volatility of product prices are beyond our control and represent a significant risk. The marketability of our production depends upon the availability and capacity of natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities. The unavailability or lack of capacity of these systems and facilities could result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. Our ability to market oil and natural gas also depends on other factors beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nthe level of domestic production and imports of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe proximity of natural gas production to natural gas pipelines;\n\u2022\nthe availability of pipeline capacity;\n\u2022\nthe demand for oil and natural gas by utilities and other end users;\n\u2022\nthe availability of alternate fuel sources;\n\u2022\nthe effect of inclement weather, such as hurricanes;\n\u2022\nstate and federal regulation of oil and natural gas marketing; and\n\u2022\nfederal regulation of natural gas sold or transported in interstate commerce.\nIf these factors were to change dramatically, our ability to market oil and natural gas or obtain favorable prices for our oil and natural gas could be adversely affected.\nThe explosion and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010 and the resulting oil spill may significantly increase our risks, costs and delays.\nThe explosion and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010 and the resulting oil spill may significantly impact the risks we face. The Deepwater Horizon incident and resulting legislative, regulatory and enforcement changes, including increased tort liability, could increase our liability if any incidents occur on our offshore operations. We cannot predict the ultimate impact the Deepwater Horizon incident and resulting changes in regulation of offshore oil and natural gas operations will have on our business or operations.\nIn response to the spill, and during a moratorium on deepwater (below 500 feet) drilling activities implemented between May 30, 2010 and October 12, 2010, the BOEMRE issued a series of active \u201cNotices to Lessees and Operators\u201d, or NTLs, and adopted changes to its regulations to impose a variety of new measures intended to help prevent a similar disaster in the future.\nOffshore operators, including those operating in deepwater, OCS waters and shallow waters, where we have substantial operations, must comply with strict new safety and operating requirements. For example, permit applications for drilling projects must meet new standards with respect to well design, casing and cementing, blowout preventers, safety certification, emergency response, and worker training. Operators of all offshore waters are also required to demonstrate the availability of adequate spill response and blowout containment resources. In addition, the BSEE imposed, for the first time, requirements that offshore operators maintain comprehensive safety and environmental programs. Such developments have the potential to increase our costs of doing business.\nOur costs to maintain compliance with regulations applicable to our offshore operations may continue to increase.\nRegulations with respect to offshore operations govern, among other things, engineering and construction specifications for production facilities, safety procedures, plugging and abandonment of wells on the OCS of the Gulf of Mexico and removal of facilities. Lessees subject to these regulations are generally required to have substantial net worth or post bonds or other acceptable assurances so that the various obligations of lessees on the Gulf of Mexico shelf will be met. While we have been exempt from such supplemental bonding requirements in the past, beginning in 2014 we were required to post supplemental bonding or alternate form of collateral for certain of our offshore properties. We have been able to satisfy the collateral requirements\nusing a combination of our existing cash on hand and the issuance of supplemental bonds. However, BSEE and BOEM are currently reassessing decommissioning liability and supplemental bonding requirements for all operations on the GOM OCS with respect to decommissioning wells and platforms in the Gulf of Mexico and are updating all decommissioning costs in the Gulf of Mexico. While our cost of compliance with supplemental bonding requirements has not been material to date, based on the ongoing review of such decommissioning and abandonment costs, our potential liability for such costs has become more expensive and as a result supplemental bonding costs may continue to increase.\nFederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to oil and natural gas development and hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to enhance oil and natural gas production. Hydraulic fracturing using fluids other than diesel is currently exempt from regulation under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, but opponents of hydraulic fracturing have called for further study of the technique's environmental effects and, in some cases, a moratorium on the use of the technique. Several proposals have been submitted to Congress that, if implemented, would subject all hydraulic fracturing to regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Further, the USEPA is conducting a scientific study to investigate the possible relationships between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water. The USEPA published a progress report on this study in December 2012, but has delayed release of its final draft report previously expected in 2014. The USEPA has also promulgated rules to limit air emissions from many hydraulically fractured natural gas wells. The new regulations will require use of equipment to capture gases that come from the well during the drilling process (so-called green completions). Other new requirements mandate tighter standards for emissions associated with gas production, storage and transport. Additionally, in May 2012, the BLM proposed rules to regulate the use of hydraulic fracturing on federal and tribal lands, but following extensive public comment on the proposals, issued a revised proposal in May 2013. The revised proposal which also addresses disclosure of fluids used in the fracturing process, integrity of well construction, and the management and disposal of wastewater that flows back from the drilling process, has also generated substantial public comment and no final rule has yet been promulgated.\nA number of states, including Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas, have required operators or service companies to disclose chemical components in fluids used for hydraulic fracturing. Some states have also imposed, or are considering, more stringent regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production activities involving hydraulic fracturing by, among other things, promulgating well completion requirements, imposing controls on storage, recycling and disposal of flowback fluids, and increasing reporting obligations. In addition, concerns related to the impacts from hydraulic fracturing have led several states and locations to ban new natural gas development or to impose moratoria on use of hydraulic fracturing in various sensitive areas including some areas overlying the Marcellus Shale. Similar action could be taken to preclude or limit natural gas development in other locations.\nRecent seismic events have been observed in some areas (including Oklahoma, Ohio and Texas) where hydraulic fracturing has taken place. Some scientists believe the increased seismic activity may result from deep well fluid injection associated with use of hydraulic fracturing. Additional regulatory measures designed to minimize or avoid damage to geologic formations have been imposed in states, including Ohio and Texas, to address such concerns.\nConcerns regarding climate change have led the Congress, various states and environmental agencies to consider a number of initiatives to restrict or regulate emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. Among other things, in the absence of new federal legislation, the USEPA promulgated regulations imposing reporting and other requirements on sources of significant emissions of greenhouse gases. Stricter regulations of greenhouse gases could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations, or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. In addition, climate change that results in physical effects such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events, could disrupt our exploration and production operations and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for and responding to those effects.\nAlthough it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the USEPA's study or the requirements of any additional federal, state or local legislation or regulation regarding hydraulic fracturing, management of drilling fluids, well integrity requirements or climate change, any new federal or state restrictions imposed on oil and gas exploration and production activities in areas in which we conduct business could significantly increase our operating, capital and compliance costs as well as delay our ability to develop oil and natural gas reserves. In addition to increased regulation of our business, we may also experience an increase in litigation seeking damages as a result of heightened public concerns related to air quality, water quality, and other environmental impacts.\nThe adoption of derivatives legislation by Congress, and implementation of that legislation by federal agencies, could have an adverse impact on our ability to mitigate risks associated with our business.\nOn July 21, 2010, the President signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Reform Act, which, among other provisions, establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market. The legislation required the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, or the CFTC, and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation, which they have done since late 2010. The CFTC has introduced dozens of proposed rules coming out of the Dodd-Frank Reform Act, and has promulgated numerous final rules based on those proposals. The effect of the proposed rules and any additional regulations on our business is not yet entirely clear, but it is increasingly clear that the costs of derivatives-based hedging for commodities will likely increase for all market participants. Of particular concern, the Dodd-Frank Reform Act does not explicitly exempt end users from the requirements to post margin in connection with hedging activities. While several senators have indicated that it was not the intent of the Act to require margin from end users, the exemption is not in the Act. While rules proposed by the CFTC and federal banking regulators appear to allow for non-cash collateral and certain exemptions from margin for end users, the rules are not final and uncertainty remains. The full range of new Dodd-Frank requirements to be enacted, to the extent applicable to us or our derivatives counterparties, may result in increased costs and cash collateral requirements for the types of derivative instruments we use to mitigate and otherwise manage our financial and commercial risks related to fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices. In addition, final rules were promulgated by the CFTC imposing federally-mandated position limits covering a wide range of derivatives positions, including non-exchange traded bilateral swaps related to commodities including oil and natural gas. These position limit rules were vacated by a Federal court in September 2012, and the CFTC has appealed that decision and could re-promulgate the rules in a manner that addresses the defects identified by the court. If these position limits rules go into effect in the future, they are likely to increase regulatory monitoring and compliance costs for all market participants, even where a given trading entity is not in danger of breaching position limits. These and other regulatory developments stemming from the Dodd-Frank Reform Act, including stringent new reporting requirements for derivatives positions and detailed criteria that must be satisfied to continue to enter into uncleared swap transactions, could have a material impact on our derivatives trading and hedging activities in the form of increased transaction costs and compliance responsibilities. Any of the foregoing consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nProposed changes to U.S. tax laws, if adopted, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFrom time to time legislative proposals are made that would, if enacted, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws. These proposed changes have included, among others, eliminating the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs, eliminating the deduction from income for domestic production activities relating to oil and natural gas exploration and development, repealing the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties and extending the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. Such proposed changes in the U.S. tax laws, if adopted, or other similar changes that reduce or eliminate deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face strong competition from larger oil and natural gas companies that may negatively affect our ability to carry on operations.\nWe operate in the highly competitive areas of oil and natural gas exploration, development and production. Factors that affect our ability to compete successfully in the marketplace include:\n\u2022\nthe availability of funds and information relating to a property;\n\u2022\nthe standards established by us for the minimum projected return on investment; and\n\u2022\nthe transportation of natural gas.\nOur competitors include major integrated oil companies, substantial independent energy companies, affiliates of major interstate and intrastate pipelines and national and local natural gas gatherers, many of which possess greater financial and other resources than we do. If we are unable to successfully compete against our competitors, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOperating hazards may adversely affect our ability to conduct business.\nOur operations are subject to risks inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, such as:\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions including blowouts, cratering and explosions;\n\u2022\nuncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids;\n\u2022\nequipment failures, fires or accidents;\n\u2022\npollution and other environmental risks; and\n\u2022\nshortages in experienced labor or shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment.\nThese risks could result in substantial losses to us from injury and loss of life, damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution and other environmental damage and suspension of operations. Our offshore operations are also subject to a variety of operating risks peculiar to the marine environment, such as hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions and more extensive governmental regulation. These regulations may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for pollution damage or result in the interruption or termination of operations.\nEnvironmental compliance costs and environmental liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nOur operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may:\n\u2022\nrequire the acquisition of permits before drilling commences;\n\u2022\nrestrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment from drilling and production activities;\n\u2022\nlimit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas;\n\u2022\nrequire remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former operations, such as plugging abandoned wells; and\n\u2022\nimpose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations.\nThe trend toward stricter requirements and standards in environmental legislation and regulation is likely to continue. Our drilling plans may be delayed, modified or precluded as a result of new or modified environmental mandates, including those imposed to protect the American Burying Beetle and other endangered species that may be present in the vicinity of our operations. The enactment of stricter legislation or the adoption of stricter regulations could have a significant impact on our operating costs, as well as on the oil and natural gas industry in general.\nOur operations could result in liability for personal injuries, property damage, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean-up costs and other environmental damages. We could also be liable for environmental damages caused by previous property owners. As a result, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We maintain insurance coverage for our operations, including limited coverage for sudden and accidental environmental damages, but this insurance may not extend to the full potential liability that could be caused by sudden and accidental environmental damages and further may not cover environmental damages that occur over time. Accordingly, we may be subject to liability or may lose the ability to continue exploration or production activities upon substantial portions of our properties if certain environmental damages occur.\nWe cannot control the activities on properties we do not operate and we are unable to ensure the proper operation and profitability of these non-operated properties.\nWe do not operate all of the properties in which we have an interest. As a result, we have limited ability to exercise influence over, and control the risks associated with, the operation of these properties. The success and timing of drilling and development activities on our partially owned properties operated by others therefore will depend upon a number of factors outside of our control, including the operator's:\n\u2022\ntiming and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nexpertise and diligence in adequately performing operations and complying with applicable agreements;\n\u2022\nfinancial resources;\n\u2022\ninclusion of other participants in drilling wells; and\n\u2022\nuse of technology.\nAs a result of any of the above or an operator's failure to act in ways that are in our best interest, our allocated production revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOwnership of working interests and overriding royalty interests in certain of our properties by certain of our officers and directors potentially creates conflicts of interest.\nCertain of our executive officers and directors or their respective affiliates are working interest owners or overriding royalty interest owners in certain properties. In their capacity as working interest owners, they are required to pay their proportionate share of all costs and are entitled to receive their proportionate share of revenues in the normal course of business. As overriding royalty interest owners they are entitled to receive their proportionate share of revenues in the normal course of business. There is a potential conflict of interest between us and such officers and directors with respect to the drilling of additional wells or other development operations with respect to these properties.\nLoss of our information and computer systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe are heavily dependent on our information systems and computer based programs, including our well operations information, seismic data, electronic data processing and accounting data. If any of such programs or systems were to fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure, possible consequences include our loss of communication links, inability to find, produce, process and sell oil and natural gas and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.\nTerrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the United States or other countries may adversely affect the United States and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations. If any of these events occur, the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas, potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our services and causing a reduction in our revenues. Oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks, and our operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our customers' operations is destroyed or damaged. Costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all.\nRisks Relating to Our Outstanding Common Stock\nOur stock price could be volatile, which could cause you to lose part or all of your investment.\nThe stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. In particular, the market price of our common stock, like that of the securities of other energy companies, has been and may continue to be highly volatile. During 2014, the sales price of our stock ranged from a low of $3.15 per share (on December 15, 2014) to a high of $7.82 per share (on June 30, 2014). Factors such as announcements concerning changes in prices of oil and natural gas, the success of our acquisition, exploration and development activities, the availability of capital, and economic and other external factors, as well as period-to-period fluctuations and financial results, may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock.\nFrom time to time, there has been limited trading volume in our common stock. In addition, there can be no assurance that there will continue to be a trading market or that any securities research analysts will continue to provide research coverage with respect to our common stock. It is possible that such factors will adversely affect the market for our common stock.\nIssuance of shares in connection with financing transactions or under stock incentive plans will dilute current stockholders.\nWe have issued 1,495,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, which are presently convertible into 5,147,734 shares of our common stock. In addition, pursuant to our stock incentive plan, our management is authorized to grant stock awards to our employees, directors and consultants. You will incur dilution upon the conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock, the exercise of any outstanding stock awards or the grant of any restricted stock. In addition, if we raise additional funds by issuing additional common stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for common stock, further dilution to our existing stockholders will result, and new investors could have rights superior to existing stockholders.\nThe number of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our stock.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had reserved approximately 1.5 million shares of common stock for issuance under outstanding options and approximately 5.1 million shares issuable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock. All of these shares of common stock are registered for sale or resale on currently effective registration statements. We may issue additional restricted securities or register additional shares of common stock under the Securities Act in the future. The issuance of a significant number of shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options, the granting of restricted stock or the conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock, or the availability for sale, or sale, of a substantial number of the shares of our common stock eligible for future sale under effective registration statements, under Rule 144 or otherwise, could adversely affect the market price of the common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may delay, discourage, prevent or render more difficult an attempt to obtain control of our company, whether through a tender offer, business combination, proxy contest or otherwise. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nthe charter authorization of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock;\n\u2022\nprovisions that directors may be removed only for cause, and then only on approval of holders of a majority of the outstanding voting stock;\n\u2022\na restriction on the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting and take actions by written consent; and\n\u2022\nprovisions regulating the ability of our stockholders to nominate directors for election or to bring matters for action at annual meetings of our stockholders.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is restricted.\nWe have not paid dividends on our common stock, in cash or otherwise, and intend to retain our cash flow from operations for the future operation and development of our business. We are currently restricted from paying dividends on our common stock by our bank credit facility, the indenture governing the 10% senior notes and, in some circumstances, by the terms of our Series B Preferred Stock. Any future dividends also may be restricted by our then-existing debt agreements.", "PERMNO": 78186, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "PQUEQ"}
