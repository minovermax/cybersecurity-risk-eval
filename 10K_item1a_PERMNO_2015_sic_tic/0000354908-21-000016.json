{"cik": "354908", "company": "FLIR SYSTEMS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. If we are unable to adequately respond to these risks and uncertainties, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, we cannot guarantee that any actions taken to reduce known risks and uncertainties will be effective.\nRisks Related to Our Pending Acquisition\nOn January 4, 2021, Teledyne Technologies Inc. (\u201cTeledyne\u201d) and the Company announced that the companies have entered into a definitive merger agreement (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) under which Teledyne will acquire FLIR in a cash and stock transaction. In connection with the proposed acquisition, the Company is subject to certain risks including, but not limited to, those set forth below\nFLIR and Teledyne may be unable to satisfy the conditions required to complete the Mergers. Any delay in completing the Mergers could diminish the anticipated benefits of the Mergers, and failure to complete the Mergers could adversely impact the market price of our stock as well as our business and operating results.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub I will merge with and into FLIR, with FLIR surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Teledyne (the \u201cFirst Merger\u201d) and immediately thereafter, FLIR will merge with and into Merger Sub II, with Merger Sub II surviving the subsequent merger (the \u201cSecond Merger\u201d, and, together with the First Merger, the \u201cMergers\u201d). The consummation of the Mergers is subject to a number of conditions, including (1) the adoption by FLIR\u2019s stockholders of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, (2) the approval by Teledyne\u2019s stockholders of the issuance of shares of Teledyne common stock as consideration in the Mergers, (3) the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, and (4) obtaining authorizations, consents or approvals required under certain other laws, or terminations or expirations of applicable waiting periods, and (5) other customary closing conditions.\nWhile FLIR and Teledyne intend to seek the required stockholder approvals and pursue vigorously all required governmental clearances, each such requirement could delay the Mergers or result in an inability to complete them. Any delay in the completion of the Mergers could diminish anticipated benefits of the Mergers, including realization of expected synergies and operating efficiencies, or result in additional transaction costs, loss of revenue or other effects associated with uncertainty about the Mergers. We cannot guarantee that the Mergers will be consummated on the terms or timeline currently contemplated or at all. If the Mergers are not completed for any reason, FLIR\u2019s ongoing business may be adversely affected, and FLIR would be subject to several risks, including:\n\u2022negative reactions from the financial markets (including negative impacts on our stock price), employees, customers, vendors and industry contracts;\n\u2022an obligation to pay costs relating to the Mergers whether or not the Mergers are completed;\n\u2022substantial commitment of time and resources by management on matters relating to the Mergers (including integration planning), which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to FLIR as an independent company; and\n\u2022an obligation to pay a termination fee of $250 million to Teledyne in certain circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement.\nIf the Mergers are not completed, these risks may materialize and may adversely affect FLIR\u2019s businesses, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nThe pendency of the Mergers could adversely affect our business and operations.\nWhether or not the Mergers are ultimately consummated, the pendency of the Mergers could have several negative effects on our current business, including potentially disrupting our regular operations, diverting the attention of our workforce and management team, or increasing workforce turnover. The completion of the Mergers, including, for example, efforts to obtain regulatory clearances, will require significant time and attention from our management and may divert attention from the day-to-day operations of our business.\nParties with which we have business relationships, either contractual or operational, may experience uncertainty as to the future or desirability of such relationships and may delay or defer certain business decisions, seek alternative relationships with third parties or seek to alter their present business relationships with us. Parties with whom we otherwise may have sought to establish business relationships may seek alternative relationships with third parties. Additionally, we have contracts with certain customers, suppliers, vendors, distributors and other business partners, and these contracts may require us to obtain consent from these other parties in connection with the Mergers. Obtaining such consents may be difficult and could impose costs on us, including renegotiating such contracts on terms less favorable to us, which in turn may result in us suffering a loss of potential future revenue, incurring contractual liabilities or losing rights that are material to our business.\nThe Merger Agreement subjects us to restrictions on our business activities and obligates us to generally operate our business in the ordinary course of business in all material respects prior to completion of the Mergers. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that arise prior to the completion of the Mergers and are outside the ordinary course of business, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nIn connection with the pending Mergers, current and prospective employees of the Company may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the Company (and Teledyne) following the consummation of the Mergers, which may materially adversely affect the ability of the Company to attract, retain and motivate key personnel while the Mergers are pending. Despite the Company\u2019s retention planning and programs that the Company has and will implement, key employees may depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration with Teledyne or a desire not to remain with the Company (and Teledyne) following the consummation of the Mergers. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to attract and retain key employees to the same extent that the Company has been able to in the past.\nThe pursuit of the proposed Mergers and the preparation for the integration with Teledyne may place a significant burden on the Company\u2019s management and internal resources. The diversion of management\u2019s attention away from day-to-day business concerns could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Mergers. The substantial majority of these costs will be non-recurring expenses relating to the Mergers. Many of these costs are payable regardless of whether or not the Mergers are consummated. The Company may be subject to litigation related to the proposed Mergers, which could result in significant costs and expenses. Even if the proposed Mergers are not consummated, these risks may materialize and may adversely affect the Company's businesses, financial condition, financial results and stock price.\nThe merger consideration is fixed and will not be adjusted. Because the market price of Teledyne\u2019s common stock may fluctuate, FLIR stockholders cannot be sure of the market value of the stock consideration they will receive in exchange for their FLIR shares in connection with the Mergers.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, our stockholders will receive a fixed number of shares of Teledyne common stock in the Mergers rather than a number of shares with a fixed market value. Upon completion of the Mergers, our stockholders will receive, in exchange for each share of our common stock held immediately prior to the Mergers, (i) $28.00 in cash and (ii) 0.0718 shares of Teledyne common stock. The market prices of shares of Teledyne common stock and FLIR common stock have fluctuated since the date of the announcement of the Merger Agreement and will continue to fluctuate until the Mergers are completed. The market values of Teledyne common stock and FLIR common stock at the time of the Mergers may vary significantly from their prices on the date of the Merger Agreement or the date hereof. Such changes in market prices may result from a variety of factors that are beyond our control, including changes in businesses, operations, and prospects, regulatory considerations, governmental actions, and legal proceedings and developments. Because the merger consideration exchange ratio will not be adjusted to reflect any changes in the market prices of Teledyne common stock or our common stock, the market value of the Teledyne common stock issued in the Mergers and our common stock surrendered in the Mergers may be higher or lower than the values of such stock on earlier dates.\nRisks, Uncertainties and Other Factors Related to Our Business\nWe depend on the United States government for a material portion of our business and changes in government spending could adversely affect our business.\nWe derive significant revenue from contracts or subcontracts funded by United States government agencies.\nA significant reduction in the purchase of our products by these agencies or contractors for these agencies would have a material adverse effect on our business. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, approximately 31 percent, 32 percent and 29 percent, respectively, of our revenues were derived directly or indirectly from sales to the United States government and its agencies. The funding of contracts awarded to us depends on the overall United States government budget and appropriations process, which is beyond our control. A failure to pass budget appropriations, adopt continuing funding resolutions or other budgetary decisions limiting or delaying federal government spending, could reduce government spending on our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our business and our operating results.\nIn addition, at its discretion, the United States government may change its spending priorities and/or terminate, reduce or modify contracts. Substantial uncertainty exists in the spending levels and priorities of the United States government, particularly with respect to military expenditures. Continued and further reductions in military spending could have a material adverse effect on our results from operations.\nConsiderable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will unfold, including the defense spending priorities of the United States government agencies. Any failure by the United States government to timely enact annual appropriations bills could restrict new contract or program starts, presenting resource allocation challenges and placing limitations on some planned program budgets. We may also face another United States government shutdown of unknown duration. If a prolonged government shutdown of the Department of Defense were to occur, it could result in program cancellations, disruptions and/or stop work orders and could limit the United States government\u2019s ability effectively to progress programs and to make timely payments, limit our ability to obtain necessary export licenses to ship internationally, and limit our ability to perform on our United States government contracts and successfully compete for new work. Consequently, significant delays or reductions in appropriations; long-term funding under a continuing resolution; an extended debt ceiling breach or government shutdown; and/or future budget and program decisions, among other items, may negatively impact our business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a United States government supplier, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations.\nAs a government contractor, we must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements and we have been, and expect to continue to be, subject to routine and non-routine audits and investigations by United States government agencies. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and impose certain risks and costs on our business. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Contract Management Agency and others, routinely audit and review a contractor\u2019s performance on government contracts, indirect rates and pricing practices, and compliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations and standards. They also review the adequacy of the contractor\u2019s compliance with government standards for its business systems. Adverse findings in these investigations, audits, or reviews can lead to criminal, civil or administrative proceedings, and the Company could face disallowance of previously billed costs, penalties, fines, compensatory damages and suspension or debarment from doing business with governmental agencies. Due to the Company\u2019s reliance on government contracts, adverse findings could also have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, including its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, violations of these regulations or other unrelated laws and statutes can lead to debarment and other penalties as well as have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. If we fail to comply with procurement rules and regulations and other laws and statutes, the results could include: reductions in the value of contracts; contract modifications or termination; the assessment of penalties and fines; and/or suspension or debarment from United States government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time or permanently. An adverse action by the United States government could also result in lost sales to non-governmental customers who might disqualify us as a result of such adverse action. The impairment or loss of our government contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOperating margins may be negatively impacted by reduction in sales or by a change in the mix of products sold.\nOur expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future sales and these expenses are largely fixed in the short term. Some expenses, such as those related to research and development activities, would likely be maintained in the event of a sales downturn in order to maintain and enhance our long-term competitiveness. We maintain inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials at levels we believe are necessary to meet anticipated sales. Accordingly, we may not be able to reduce our costs in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall between forecasted and actual sales. Any significant shortfall of sales may result in us carrying higher levels of inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials thereby increasing our risk of inventory obsolescence and corresponding inventory write-downs and write-offs.\nOur fixed costs, including facilities and information technology costs, compliance and public company costs, and depreciation and amortization related to previous acquisitions and capital expenditures, are significant and are difficult to reduce in the short term. Our operating margins vary by product and substantial changes in the mix of products sold could also have a negative impact on our operating margins.\nWe may experience impairment in the value of our tangible and intangible assets.\nOur industry is subject to rapid changes in technology, which may result in unexpected obsolescence or impairment of our assets. Our intangible assets, including goodwill, represent a significant portion of our total assets. Most of these intangibles are the result of acquisitions in which the purchase price exceeded the value of the tangible assets acquired. We amortize certain of these intangibles over their anticipated useful life and review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if warranted by events. We have previously experienced impairments and may experience additional impairments in the future. In addition, certain of our tangible assets such as inventory and machinery and equipment may experience impairment in their value as a result of events such as the introduction of new products, changes in technology or changes in customer demand patterns. We depreciate our machinery and equipment at levels we believe are adequate, but future impairments may materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved, and additional claims may arise in the future. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and could cause significant expense and diversion of management attention. From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits concerning intellectual property, torts, contracts, shareholder litigation, administrative and regulatory proceedings and other matters, as well as governmental inquiries and investigations, the outcomes of which may be significant to our results of operations and may limit our ability to engage in our business activities. In recognition of these considerations, we have and may in the future enter into material settlements to avoid ongoing costs and efforts in defending or pursuing a matter. Should we fail to prevail in certain matters, or should several of these matters be resolved against us in the same reporting period, we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. While we have insurance related to our business operations, it may not apply to or fully cover liabilities we incur as a result of these lawsuits. We record accruals for liabilities where we believe a loss to be probable and reasonably estimable. However, our actual costs may differ materially from these estimated liabilities.\nWe face risks from international sales and business activities.\nWe market and sell our products worldwide and international sales have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a significant portion of our revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, international sales accounted for 46 percent, 45 percent and 47 percent, respectively, of our total revenue. We also manufacture certain products and subassemblies in Europe and we have several contract manufacturing agreements with third parties in Europe and in Asia. Certain of these products, particularly our thermal and infrared products, are subject to substantial government regulation and licensing and end use restrictions throughout the world. Our international business activities are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022the imposition of and changes to governmental licensing restrictions and controls impacting our technology and products;\n\u2022restrictions and prohibitions on the export of technology and products, including any applicable changes in regulation prohibiting the sale of certain of our products to certain end users without a license;\n\u2022international trade restrictions, such as imposition of bans on sales of goods or services to one or more of our significant foreign customers;\n\u2022difficulty in collecting receivables and governmental restrictions with respect to currency;\n\u2022inadequate protection of intellectual property;\n\u2022labor union activities;\n\u2022changes in tariffs and taxes;\n\u2022restrictions on repatriation of prior earnings;\n\u2022restriction on the importation and exportation of goods and services;\n\u2022risks, costs, impacts and obligations associated with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws applicable to us, and laws applicable to global trade and United States exports and costs and penalties from violations of such laws and related regulations, including the costs associated with required remedial and other increased compliance activity;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022instability in economic or political conditions, inflation, recession, actual or anticipated military or political conflicts, and potential impact due to the exit of the United Kingdom (the \"U.K.\") from the European Union (the \"EU\"), colloquially referred to as \"Brexit\"; and\n\u2022complications due to natural, nuclear or other disasters, such as outbreak of coronavirus.\nThese factors may have an adverse impact on our sales and operations, increase our cost of doing business or subject our business or operations to additional rules, policies and procedures.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 outbreak could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThroughout 2020 and continuing into 2021, the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) and efforts to contain its spread have resulted in international, national and local border closings and other significant travel restrictions and disruptions, significant disruptions to business operations, supply chains and customer activity, event cancellations and restrictions, service cancellations, reductions and other changes, significant challenges in healthcare service preparation and delivery, quarantines and related government actions and policies, as well as general concern and uncertainty that has negatively affected the U.S. and global economy and financial environments. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial condition is uncertain and difficult to predict, but the COVID-19 pandemic could cause sudden, significant disruptions in our business operations, including the following:\n\u2022We have experienced and may continue to experience disruptions in our supply chain from the actions of governments or businesses intended to contain or slow the spread of the virus, such as closing factories or other operations that produce components necessary for our products, quarantining individuals around major commercial hubs, and/or restricting the transportation of goods and services.\n\u2022We may experience significant workplace disruptions as a result of employees in our production facilities becoming sick or are quarantined as a result of exposure to COVID-19, which could necessitate closing such facilities or significantly reducing their output for an extended period.\n\u2022Delays in inspection, acceptance and payment by our customers, many of whom are working remotely, could also affect our sales and cash flows. Limitations on government operations can also impact regulatory approvals such as export licenses that are needed for international sales and deliveries. In addition, we could experience delays in international orders, many of which require lines of credit from local banks whose operations may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Defense Technologies segment has and may continue to experience delays in orders from United States and foreign government agencies, and the Industrial Technologies segment has and may continue to experience a decline in demand for industrial and consumer products that are deemed non-essential. As a result of the COVID-19 crisis, there may be changes in our customers\u2019 priorities and practices, as our customers confront competing budget priorities and more limited resources. These changes may impact current and future programs, government payments and other practices, procurements, and funding decisions.\n\u2022Pursuant to government closure orders intended to contain or slow the spread of the virus, we have been required to close certain of our facilities that perform work that is deemed non-essential. One or more additional facilities could become subject to similar orders, which could further disrupt our operations if the work performed at such facilities cannot be conducted remotely, which may necessitate the furloughing of some of our employees or a permanent reduction in our workforce.\n\u2022If we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic, or if customers do not perceive our response to be adequate, we could suffer damage to our reputation and our brands, which could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022Deterioration of worldwide credit and financial markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms and continue to meet our liquidity needs.\nIn addition, across the globe, the response to the pandemic generally has involved a dramatic, rapid reduction in social and economic activity, which has led to a global recession which could be protracted. The global economic downturn caused by the pandemic could continue to reduce demand for certain other products and services, particularly those with industrial or consumer applications. Furthermore, the resumption of our normal business operations after COVID-19-related interruptions may be delayed or constrained by lingering effects of COVID-19 on our suppliers, third-party service providers, and/or customers.\nWe continue to monitor the evolving situation related to COVID-19. The effects described above, alone or taken together, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, legal exposure, or financial condition. A further sustained or prolonged outbreak could exacerbate the adverse impact of such effects. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operations or financial results will further depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including additional actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals to contain the virus or address its impact, new information which may emerge concerning the severity or treatability of the virus, the successful rollout of vaccines, new strains of the virus and the extent of the economic downturn resulting from the response to the virus, among other factors.\nWe are subject to numerous regulatory requirements for the export and sale of our products and operations worldwide that could adversely affect our business.\nCompliance with complex foreign and United States laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business both in the United States and in international jurisdictions. These regulations include import and export laws, anti-competition laws, anti-corruption laws, such as the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, data privacy requirements, tax laws, and accounting, internal control and disclosure requirements. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our reputation, business and results of operations. In certain foreign jurisdictions, there is a higher risk of fraud or corruption and greater difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls and compliance programs. Further, although we have implemented and continue to implement policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws and regulations.\nOn April 24, 2018, we entered into a Consent Agreement with the United States Department of State\u2019s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (\u201cDDTC\u201d) to resolve allegations regarding the unauthorized export of technical data and defense services to dual and third country nationals in certain of our facilities, the failure to properly use and manage export licenses and export authorizations, and failures to report certain payments under 22 CFR Part 130 in potential violation of ITAR. The Consent Agreement has a four-year term and provides for: (i) a civil penalty of $30 million with $15 million of this amount suspended on the condition that the funds have or will be used for Department-approved Consent Agreement remedial compliance measures, (ii) the appointment of an external Special Compliance Official to oversee compliance with the Consent Agreement and the ITAR; (iii) two external audits of our ITAR compliance program; and (iv) continued implementation of ongoing remedial compliance measures and additional remedial compliance measures related to automated systems and ITAR compliance policies, procedures, and training. Adverse findings in the audits of our ITAR compliance program could materially affect our competitive position and cause incurrence of additional expenses in connection with implementation of remedial measures and result in a substantial adjustment to our revenue and net income. During the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, we recorded a $15.0 million charge for the portion of the penalty that is not subject to suspension. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining amounts payable of $3.5 million and $3.5 million have been recorded in other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities, respectively. Our investments to date in remedial compliance measures have been sufficient to cover the $15.0 million suspension amount.\nAs part of the Consent Agreement, DDTC acknowledged that we voluntarily disclosed certain of the alleged Arms Export Control Act and ITAR violations (which were resolved pursuant to the Consent Agreement), cooperated in DDTC\u2019s review, and instituted a number of compliance program improvements.\nIn addition, our international contracts may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific in-country purchases, investments, manufacturing agreements or other financial obligations, known as offset obligations, and may provide for penalties if we fail to meet such requirements. The impact of these factors is difficult to predict, but one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining and maintaining the necessary export licenses to conduct operations abroad and the United States government may prevent proposed sales to foreign governments and customers.\nExport licenses and other authorizations may be required from United States government agencies under the ITAR, the EAR, the Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulations, the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the Arms Export Control Act of 1976, and other similar laws and regulations for the sale, use and export of many of our products and related data and services.\nThermal and infrared products and technical data have been subject to the ITAR and EAR, historically under United States Munitions List (\"USML\") Category XII and Commerce Control List (\"CCL\") Category 6. The United States government\u2019s export reform effort resulted in the transition of various Company products from the USML to the CCL, shifting the licensing requirements and restrictions for products regulated by the Department of Commerce under the EAR. This transition has increased the licensing requirements and restrictions on some products and reduced the requirements and restrictions on others. We may not be successful in obtaining the necessary licenses from the United States Department of State or Department of Commerce required to conduct our business as presently or historically conducted.\nThe United States export licensing environment has been affected by a number of factors, including the aftermath of 9/11, the rise of terrorism and the changing geopolitical environment, heightened tensions with other countries (which shift and evolve over time), and the United States' reliance on night-time warfare. Some of these factors have affected the thermal imaging and infrared technology industry overall while others have impacted us directly. In addition, the Consent Agreement and related submissions and other communications concerning our licensing posture overall have led to heightened scrutiny of export licenses for products in our markets and, in some cases, highlight DDTC\u2019s focus on the manner in which we handle exports of our products, technical data and services subject to the ITAR.\nIn addition, concerns with respect to potential diversion of certain of our products to prohibited end users and countries subject to economic and other sanctions implemented by the United States government has caused the United States Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security to restrict our ability to sell 9hz thermal products without a license to customers in China not identified on a list maintained by the United States Department of Commerce.\nAlthough we have taken actions and continue to take additional actions necessary to implement policies and procedures to promote an improved compliance culture and programs, during the normal course of our business, we have experienced and we expect to continue to experience violations of ITAR and EAR, none of which has been material to the Company to date. Material violations of these legal requirements can be punishable by criminal fines and imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions, debarment from government contracts, seizure and forfeiture of unlawful attempted exports, and/or denial of export privileges, as well as other remedial measures. We have established policies and procedures designed to assist us, our personnel and our agents to comply with applicable U.S. and international laws and regulations. However, our policies and procedures may not effectively prevent us, our employees and our agents from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage, and violations, allegations or investigations of such violations could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Government agencies might view our actions and programs with heightened scrutiny, including as a result of events outside of our control. As a result, we may receive more restrictive provisions or limitations on new license requests, wholesale denials of our license requests, suspensions or terminations of our existing licenses, or delays in receiving new licenses resulting from requests for follow-up information, due diligence requests or additional limitations on our sale to third parties. We may be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses required to facilitate our international business. Failures to obtain or delays in obtaining licenses may prevent or limit our ability to market, sell, export, or transfer our products outside the United States and has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business and our operating results.\nWe face risks from Brexit.\nBrexit has created uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.K. and the EU. The U.K. formally exited the EU on January 31, 2020. On December 24, 2020, the U.K. and EU announced they had entered into a post-Brexit deal on certain aspects of trade and other strategic and political issues, which relationship became effective on December 31, 2020.\nWe have significant operations and a substantial workforce in Europe, a portion of which reside in the U.K. and therefore enjoyed certain benefits based on the U.K.\u2019s membership in the EU. We are currently evaluating the potential financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications of the new U.K.-EU trade deal, for our U.K. and European business operations, the operations of our customers, as well as for global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets. Additionally, any development that has the effect of devaluing the European euro or British pound sterling could meaningfully reduce the value of our assets and reduce the usefulness of liquidity alternatives denominated in that currency, such as our multicurrency credit facility. While we have adopted certain operational and financial measures to reduce the risks of doing business internationally, such measures may not allow us to operate without disruption or adverse impact to our business and financial results in the affected regions. The long-term effects of Brexit will depend on the efficacy of the new U.K.-EU agreement and continuing resolution of future arrangements between the EU and the U.K., including the U.K.\u2019s access to EU markets.\nOur earnings and profitability depend, in part, on subcontractor and supplier performance and financial viability as well as raw material and component availability and pricing.\nWe rely on other parties to provide raw materials, and components and subsystems for our products and to produce certain products or parts, provide information about the parts or products they supply to us, and perform some of the services we provide to our customers, and to do so in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and contract terms. Disruptions or performance problems caused by our subcontractors and suppliers, or a misalignment between our contractual obligations to our customers and our agreement with our subcontractors and suppliers, could have various impacts on the company, including on our ability to meet our commitments to customers.\nOur ability to perform our obligations on time could be adversely affected if one or more of our subcontractors or suppliers were unable to provide the agreed-upon products, materials or information, or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely, compliant and cost-effective manner or otherwise to meet the requirements of the contract. Changes in political or economic conditions, including changes in defense budgets or credit availability or sanctions, or other changes impacting a subcontractor or supplier (including changes in ownership or operations), as well as their ability to retain talent and other resources, and requirements or changes in requirements imposed on them by other customers, could adversely affect the financial stability of our subcontractors and suppliers and/or their ability to perform. The inability of our suppliers to perform, or their inability to perform adequately, could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers, which could result in significant incremental cost and delay or the need for us to provide other resources to support our existing suppliers. This risk may increase as the demands grow for our subcontractors and suppliers to meet extensive government-related cyber and other requirements.\nIn connection with our U.S. government contracts, we are required to procure certain materials, components and parts from supply sources approved by the customer. We also are facing increased and changing regulatory requirements, both domestically and internationally, many of which apply to our subcontractors and suppliers. In some cases, there may be only one supplier, or one domestic supplier, for certain components. If a supplier cannot appropriately meet our needs, experiences disruptions to production or is otherwise unavailable or not fully available, we may be unable to find a suitable alternative.\nOur procurement practices are intended to reduce the likelihood of our procurement of counterfeit, unauthorized or otherwise non-compliant parts or materials. We rely on our subcontractors and suppliers to comply with applicable laws, regulations and contract terms, including regarding the parts or materials we procure from them; in some circumstances, we rely on certifications provided by our subcontractors and suppliers regarding their compliance. We also rely on our subcontractors and suppliers effectively to mitigate the risk of cyber and security threats or other disruptions with respect to the products, components and services they deliver to us and the information entrusted to them by us or our customers and to comply with applicable contractual terms and laws and regulations, including cybersecurity requirements.\nIf our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform or we are unable to procure, or experience significant delays in deliveries of, needed products, materials or services, or if they do not comply with all applicable laws, regulations, requirements and contract terms, including if what we receive is counterfeit or otherwise improper, our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe face risks from currency fluctuations.\nHistorically, currency fluctuations have affected our operating results. Changes in the value of foreign currencies in which our sales or costs incurred are denominated have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, fluctuations in our operating results. We seek to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations by denominating, where possible, our international sales in United States dollars, by balancing expenses and revenues in various currencies and by undertaking limited hedging of forecasted currency exposures. With respect to international sales denominated in United States dollars, a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar could make our products less price competitive.\nGeneral economic conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of capital investment and consumer spending. Economic factors that could adversely influence demand for our products include uncertainty about global economic conditions leading to reduced levels of investment, changes in government spending levels and/or priorities, the size and availability of government budgets, customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 access to credit, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting government, industrial or consumer spending behavior.\nIn recent years, our performance has been negatively impacted by reduced spending by United States government agencies, global economic weakness, and the Eurozone crisis. Continuation of the conditions that led to reduced spending and potential further reductions in spending globally by either consumers or government agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur primary markets are volatile and unpredictable.\nOur business depends on the demand for our products and solutions in a variety of commercial, industrial and government markets. In the past, the demand for our products in these markets has fluctuated due to a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022the timing, number and size of orders from, and shipments to, our customers, as well as the relative mix of those orders;\n\u2022variations in the volume of orders for a particular product or product line in a particular fiscal quarter;\n\u2022the size and timing of new contract awards;\n\u2022the timing of the release of government funds for procurement of our products; and\n\u2022the timing of orders and shipments within a given fiscal quarter.\nSeasonal fluctuations in our operating results are an outcome of:\n\u2022the seasonal pattern of contracting by the United States government and certain foreign governments;\n\u2022the desire of customers to take delivery of equipment prior to fiscal year ends due to funding considerations; and\n\u2022the tendency of commercial enterprises to utilize fully annual capital budgets prior to expiration.\nCompetition in our markets is intense and our failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business.\nCompetition in the diverse markets for our products is intense. The speed with which companies can identify new applications for thermal imaging, develop products to meet those needs and supply commercial quantities at low prices to the market are important competitive factors. We believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are product performance, price, customer service and training, product reputation, and effective marketing and sales efforts. Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, research and development, and marketing resources than we do. All of these factors, as well as the potential for increased competition from new market entrants, require us to continue to invest in, and focus on, research and development and new product innovation. We may be unable to compete effectively in the future and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur products may suffer from defects or errors leading to substantial product liability, damage or warranty claims.\nWe include complex system designs and components in our products that may contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products or release new versions. If any of our products are defective, we might be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. Such an event could result in significant expenses including expenses arising from product liability and warranty claims. It also could disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As we expand our presence into new markets, we may face increased exposure to product liability claims. We maintain product liability insurance, but it may be insufficient or become unavailable on acceptable terms.\nAmounts included in our backlog may not result in actual revenues or translate into profits.\nMany contracts are subject to cancellation or suspension on short notice at the discretion of the customer, and the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contract. We have historically experienced variances in the components of backlog related to delivery delays or cancellations resulting from customer-specific circumstances, external market factors and economic factors beyond our control, and we may experience more delays or cancellations in the future. Accordingly, our backlog may not actually be realized. If our backlog fails to materialize, we could experience a reduction in revenues and a decline in profitability, which could result in a deterioration of our financial position and liquidity.\nSignificant tariffs, restrictions on imports or other trade barriers between the United States and various countries, most significantly China, may impact our revenue and results of operations.\nGeneral trade tensions between the U.S. and China began escalating in 2018, with multiple rounds of U.S. tariffs on Chinese-made goods taking effect. These tariffs currently affect some of the components of our products we import from China, and we may raise our prices on those products due to the tariffs or share the cost of such tariffs with our customers, which could harm our operating performance or cause our customers to seek alternative suppliers. While we continue to monitor and evaluate the potential impact of the effective and proposed tariffs as well as other recent changes in foreign trade policy on our supply chain, costs, sales and profitability and are considering strategies to mitigate such impact, including reviewing sourcing options and working with our vendors and merchants, it is possible that further tariffs may be imposed on our other imports, or that our business will be impacted by retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response to existing or future tariffs, causing us to raise prices or make changes to our operations, any of which could materially harm our revenue or operating results. In addition, we may seek to shift some of our manufacturing supply chain to other countries, which could result in disruption to our operations.\nRisks, Uncertainties and Other Factors Related to Our Technology and Intellectual Property\nOur inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and avoid infringing the rights of others could harm our competitive position and our business.\nOur ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the rights of others. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. Many of our proprietary rights are held in confidence as trade secrets and are not covered by patents, making them more difficult to protect. Although we currently hold worldwide patents covering certain aspects of our technologies and products, and we are actively pursuing additional patents, we cannot be certain that we will obtain additional patents or trademarks on our technology, products and trade names. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that our patents or trademarks will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors or that measures taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will adequately deter their misappropriation or disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain or disclose our confidential information, reverse engineer or copy our technologies, products or processes, or otherwise misappropriate our intellectual property. Any failure by us to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, because intellectual property does not necessarily prevent our competitors from entering the markets we serve, we may be unable to maintain our competitive advantage and our competitors might develop capabilities equal or superior to ours.\nLitigation over patents and other intellectual property is common in our industry. During the normal course of business, we engage in litigation related to our patents and other intellectual property and cannot be sure that we will not be subject to such litigation in the future. Similarly, we may assert claims in litigation to protect our intellectual property. Lawsuits defending or prosecuting intellectual property claims and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort of our personnel. An adverse determination in a patent suit or in any other proceeding in which we are a party could subject us to significant liabilities, result in the loss of intellectual property rights we claim or impact our competitive position. Additionally, an adverse determination could require us to seek licenses from third parties. If such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, leading to a potential reduction in client base.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by cybersecurity threats and other security threats and technology disruptions.\nWe face certain security threats and technology disruptions, including threats to our information technology infrastructure, attempts to gain access to our or our customers\u2019 proprietary or classified information, including intellectual property and technology, threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, threats of terrorism events, and failures of our technology tools and systems. We are subject to laws and rules issued by various agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining infrastructure and physical security and information confidentiality. Our information technology networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to successfully perform day-to-day operations. We are also involved with information technology systems for certain customers and other third parties, for which we face similar security threats as for our own. In particular, cybersecurity threats, such as computer viruses, spyware and malware, attempts to access information, denial of service attacks and other electronic security breaches-, are persistent and evolve quickly. Such threats have increased in frequency, scope and potential impact in recent years.\nFurther, a variety of technological tools and systems, including both company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties, support our critical functions. These technologies, as well as our products, are subject to failure and the user\u2019s inability to have such technologies properly supported, updated, expanded or integrated into other technologies and may contain open source and third party software which unbeknownst to us may contain defects or viruses that pose unintended risks to our customers. If not effectively mitigated or controlled, these risks could materially harm our business or reputation. While we believe that we have implemented appropriate measures, controls, and risk transfer mechanisms designed to protect customer information and prevent data breaches, such actions may not prevent disruptions to critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential information, corruption of data, or financial loss.\nWe require user names and passwords in order to access our information technology systems. We use encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to our data or accounts. These security measures are subject to third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties may attempt to induce by fraud employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems. These security systems cannot provide absolute security. A material breach of our systems where we were unable to protect sensitive data could materially damage business partner and customer relationships, and curtail or otherwise impact the use of our information technology systems. Moreover, a security breach of our information technology system that affects our computer systems or results in the release of personally identifiable or other sensitive information of customers, business partners, employees and other third parties, could materially damage our reputation and brand, result in a decrease of the use of our products and services, and expose us to a risk of loss, litigation and potential liability.\nCybersecurity or other security threats and technology disruptions could disrupt our operations and customer and other third party information technology systems. They also could require significant management attention and resources, negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and challenge our eligibility for future work on sensitive or classified systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to respond to the rapid technological change in the markets in which we compete, our ability to introduce new or enhanced products and enter into new markets.\nThe markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological developments and frequent new product introductions, enhancements and modifications. Our ability to develop new products and technologies that anticipate changing customer requirements, reduce costs and otherwise retain or enhance our competitive position in existing and new markets will be an important factor in our future results from operations. We will continue to make substantial capital expenditures and incur significant research and development costs to improve our manufacturing capability, reduce costs, and develop and introduce new products and enhancements. If we fail to develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. In addition, our new products and technologies may not be successful and our customers may not accept our new products.\nRisks, Uncertainties and Other Factors Related to Our Corporate Structure and Organization\nWe may be unable to successfully manage recent or future acquisitions or integrate them into our operations, thereby disrupting our business and harming our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we do not close our pending transaction with Teledyne, our ongoing business model includes a certain level of ongoing acquisition, investment and divestiture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against our business objectives.\nOur financial results could be adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings associated with divestitures or increased expenses associated with acquisitions or divestitures. Furthermore, our ability to achieve the benefits we anticipate from any acquisitions we make will depend in large part upon whether we are able to leverage the capabilities of the acquired companies to grow revenue across our combined organization, manage the acquired company\u2019s business, execute our strategy in an efficient and effective manner and realize anticipated cost synergies. In addition, private companies recently acquired which were previously not subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d), may lack certain internal controls, which could ultimately affect our ability to ensure compliance with the requirements of SOX.\nThe integration of businesses, personnel, product lines and technologies can be difficult, time consuming and subject to significant risks. For example, we could lose key personnel from companies that we acquire, incur unanticipated costs, lose major sources of revenue, fail to integrate critical technologies, suffer business disruptions, fail to capture anticipated synergies, fail to establish satisfactory internal controls, or incur unanticipated liabilities. Any of these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and decrease our revenue.\nAny future acquisitions and divestitures are subject to the risks described above. Furthermore, we might assume or incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or divestitures. Additional debt may negatively impact our results and increase our financial risk, and the issuance of any additional equity securities could dilute our then existing shareholders\u2019 ownership. We may not realize anticipated benefits of any future acquisitions or divestitures, and any such acquisition or divestiture could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur strategic restructuring has consolidated our operating segments and further concentrated our product mix, which could increase risks related to the financial conditions of a more concentrated customer base and may not result in all of the intended benefits.\nWe have implemented a strategy-driven restructuring plan to simplify our product portfolio, improve operational efficiency, and drive long-term growth. Restructuring efforts included consolidation of our operating segments, targeted workforce reductions, and facility optimization initiatives. These shifts could expose the Company to a more concentrated customer base. The concentration of the Company\u2019s customer base could increase its risks related to the financial conditions of its customers. In addition, changes in the market demand for the Company\u2019s product mix could significantly affect our margins and could adversely affect our profitability and future growth. Our restructuring plan might not capture all of the intended benefits or result in the expected cost savings. Further, the restructuring may yield unintended consequences such as attrition beyond our targeted workforce reduction. These risks may impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have indebtedness as a result of the issuance of senior unsecured notes (the \u201cNotes\u201d) and borrowings against our unsecured credit facility, and we are subject to certain restrictive covenants under our unsecured credit facility and the indenture governing the Notes, and changes in the rate at which we can obtain indebtedness, any of which may limit our operational and financial flexibility.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations and comply with the financial covenants under our credit facility will be dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. Our inability to meet our debt service obligations or comply with the required covenants could result in a default under the credit facility or indenture. In the event of any such default, under the credit facility, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all outstanding debt, accrued interest and fees under the facility to be due and immediately payable. In the event of any such default under our indenture, either the trustee or the holders of at least 25 percent of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes could declare the principal amount of all of the Notes to be due and payable immediately. Certain of our indebtedness is intrinsically linked to benchmark rates that are the subject of global benchmark rate reform. On December 4, 2020 the ICE Benchmark Administration (\"IBA\") published its consultation on its intent to cease publication of certain USD LIBOR tenors along with all tenors of EUR, CHF, GBP and JPY LIBOR after December 31, 2021. Pursuant to this consultation, a complete phase out of all tenors of USD LIBOR is expected on or around June 30, 2023. Market participants were eligible to provide feedback through January 25, 2021. While we believe our exposure to market risk associated with the discontinuation of LIBOR is limited because our Notes carry a fixed-rate coupon and our unsecured credit facility agreement includes provisions for a successor rate, the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted or reasonably estimated. If LIBOR is no longer available or if our lenders have increased costs due to changes in LIBOR, it could adversely impact our interest expense, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, if at all, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ongoing results of operations.\nOur ability to refinance indebtedness, including the Notes, will depend in part on our operating and financial performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. In addition, prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing could increase our interest expense. A refinancing of our indebtedness, including the Notes, could also require us to comply with more onerous covenants and further restrict our business operations.\nOur inability to refinance our indebtedness or to do so upon favorable terms could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and make us vulnerable to adverse industry and general economic conditions.\nWe may not be adequately insured against many potential liabilities.\nAlthough we maintain insurance policies with respect to a broad range of risks, including automobile liability, general liability, workers\u2019 compensation and employee group health, these policies do not cover all possible claims and certain of the policies are subject to large deductibles. Accordingly, we are effectively self-insured for a substantial number of actual and potential claims. In addition, if any of our insurance carriers defaulted on its obligations to provide insurance coverage by reason of its insolvency or for other reasons, our exposure to claims would increase and our profits would be adversely affected. Our estimates for unpaid claims and expenses are based on known facts, historical trends and industry averages, utilizing the assistance of actuarial services. The determination of such estimated liabilities and their appropriateness are reviewed and updated at least quarterly. However, these liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to many relevant factors, the effects of which are often unknown, including the severity of an injury or damage, the determination of liability in proportion to other parties, the timeliness of reported claims, the effectiveness of our risk management and safety programs and the terms and conditions of our insurance policies. Our accruals are based upon known facts, historical trends and our reasonable estimate of future expenses, and we believe such accruals are adequate. However, unknown or changing trends, risks or circumstances, such as increases in claims, a weakening economy, increases in medical costs, changes in case law or legislation or changes in the nature of the work we perform, could render our current estimates and accruals inadequate. In such case, adjustments to our balance sheet may be required and these increased liabilities would be recorded in the period that the experience becomes known. Insurance carriers may be unwilling, in the future, to provide our current levels of coverage without a significant increase in insurance premiums and/or collateral requirements to cover our obligations to them. Increased collateral requirements may be in the form of additional letters of credit and/or cash, and an increase in collateral requirements could significantly reduce our liquidity. If insurance premiums increase, and/or if insurance claims are higher than our estimates, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nChanges in our effective income tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Sweden, Belgium and the United Kingdom, where a number of our subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the enforcement environment, and changes in tax laws or their interpretations, in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions.\nOur future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of additional factors including:\n\u2022the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\n\u2022the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;\n\u2022changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;\n\u2022increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes;\n\u2022changes in available tax credits;\n\u2022changes in share-based compensation expense;\n\u2022changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles;\n\u2022changes in foreign tax rates or agreed upon foreign taxable base; and/or\n\u2022the repatriation of earnings from outside the United States for which we have not previously provided for United States taxes.\nAny significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact net income for future periods. In addition, the United States Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns. Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if any assessments resulting from the examination of our income tax returns by the IRS or other taxing authorities are not resolved in our favor. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2018, the Swedish Tax Authority (\u201cSTA\u201d) issued a reassessment of tax for the year ending December 31, 2012 to one of the Company's non-operating subsidiaries in Sweden. The reassessment concerns the use of tax credits applied against capital gains pursuant to European Union Council Directive 2009/133/EC, commonly referred to as the EU Merger Directive, and assesses taxes and penalties totaling approximately $365.7 million (Swedish kroner 3.0 billion).\nWhile we believe the STA\u2019s assertions in the reassessment are not in accordance with Swedish tax regulations, if the STA is successful in its claim either in the short or long-term, the tax assessment could materially affect our results of operation, cash flow and financial position.\nIn addition, during 2019, the European Commission announced the opening of a separate review to assess whether an excess profit tax ruling granted by Belgium to one of our international subsidiaries is in breach of European Union state aid rules. We believe we have paid all taxes assessed by Belgium, yet an adverse opinion from the European Commission regarding the applicability of state aid rules could be cause for material accrual of tax in a future period which could affect our results of operations, cash flow and financial position.\nState of Delaware law and our governing documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover, even if the transaction would benefit our shareholders.\nOther companies may seek to acquire or merge with us. An acquisition or merger of our Company could result in benefits to our shareholders, including an increase in the value of our common stock. Some provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, including our ability to issue preferred stock without further action by our shareholders, as well as provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable.\nOur Bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur Bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for any shareholder (including any beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, other employee or shareholder of the corporation to the corporation or the corporation's shareholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or as to which the DGCL, our Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions. This choice of forum provision may limit a shareholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees and agents. Alternatively, if a court were to find this choice of forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSection 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. In addition, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or any other claim for which the federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction.", "PERMNO": 79265, "SIC": 3812, "TIC": "FLIR"}
