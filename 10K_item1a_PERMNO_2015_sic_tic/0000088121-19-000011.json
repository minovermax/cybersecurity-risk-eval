{"cik": "88121", "company": "SEABOARD CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nSeaboard has identified important risks and uncertainties that could affect the results of operations, financial condition or business and that could cause them to differ materially from Seaboard\u2019s historical results of operations, financial condition or business, or those contemplated by forward-looking statements made herein or elsewhere, by, or on behalf of, Seaboard. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those factors described below.\n(a)\nGeneral\n(1)\nSeaboard\u2019s Operations Are Subject to the General Risks of the Food Industry. The food products manufacturing industry is subject to the risks posed by:\n\u00b7\nfood spoilage;\n\u00b7\nfood contamination, including contamination caused by disease-producing organisms or pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, and pathogenic E coli;\n\u00b7\nfood allergens;\n\u00b7\nevolving consumer preferences and nutritional and health-related concerns;\n\u00b7\ninternational, foreign, federal, state and local food processing regulations;\n\u00b7\nconsumer product liability claims;\n\u00b7\nproduct recall;\n\u00b7\nproduct tampering; and\n\u00b7\npublic perception of food production practices, including handling of production and live animals.\nPathogens which may cause food contamination are found generally in livestock and in the environment and therefore may be present in Seaboard\u2019s products. These pathogens also can be introduced to its products as a result of improper handling by customers or consumers. The Company does not have control over handling procedures once products have been shipped for distribution. If one or more of these risks were to materialize, Seaboard\u2019s revenues could decrease, costs of doing business could increase, and Seaboard\u2019s operating results could be adversely affected.\n(2)\nInternational Operations Subject Seaboard to Risks That Could Have a Significant Impact on Seaboard\u2019s Business. Seaboard is a diverse agribusiness and transportation company with global operations in several industries. Most of the sales and costs of Seaboard\u2019s divisions are significantly influenced by worldwide fluctuations in commodity prices or changes in foreign political and economic conditions. Accordingly, revenues, operating income and cash flows could fluctuate significantly from year to year. In addition, Seaboard\u2019s international activities pose risks not faced by companies that limit themselves to U.S. markets. These risks include:\n\u00b7\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7\nforeign currency exchange controls;\n\u00b7\nchanges in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions, particularly in emerging markets;\n\u00b7\nhyperinflation;\n\u00b7\nheightened customer credit and execution risk;\n\u00b7\ntariffs, other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u00b7\nclosing of borders by foreign countries to the import of meat products due to animal disease or other perceived health or safety issues;\n\u00b7\npotentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;\n\u00b7\nlegal and regulatory structures and unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and any lawsuits that may arise;\n\u00b7\nnegative perception within a foreign country of a U.S. company doing business in that foreign country;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with laws and regulations for conducting international business such as Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations;\n\u00b7\nexpropriation, civil unrest and government instability; and\n\u00b7\ninconsistent application or enforcement of local laws, including tax laws.\nFORM 10-K\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n(3)\nDeterioration of Economic Conditions Could Negatively Impact Seaboard\u2019s Business. Seaboard\u2019s business may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, availability of capital markets, consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs, and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Any such changes could adversely affect the demand for Seaboard\u2019s meat products, grains, shipping services and other products, or the cost and availability of needed raw materials and packaging materials, thereby negatively affecting Seaboard\u2019s financial results. The current national and global economic conditions, could, among other things:\n\u00b7\nimpair the financial condition of some of Seaboard\u2019s customers and suppliers, thereby increasing customer bad debts or non-performance by customers and suppliers;\n\u00b7\nnegatively impact global demand for protein and grain-based products, which could result in a reduction of revenues, operating income and cash flows;\n\u00b7\ndecrease the value of Seaboard\u2019s investments in equity and debt securities, including pension plan assets, causing losses that would adversely impact Seaboard\u2019s net earnings; and\n\u00b7\nimpair the financial viability of Seaboard\u2019s insurers.\n(4)\nDecentralization May Present Certain Risks. Seaboard is relatively decentralized in comparison with its peers. While the Company believes this practice enabled it to remain responsive to opportunities and to customers\u2019 needs, it necessarily places significant control and decision-making powers in the hands of local management. This presents various risks, including the risk that management may be slower or less able to identify or react to problems affecting a key business than in a more centralized environment. In addition, it means that the Company may be slower to detect compliance related problems (e.g., a rogue employee undertaking activities that are prohibited by applicable law or the Company\u2019s internal policies) and that \u201ccompany-wide\u201d business initiatives, such as the integration of disparate information technology systems, are often more challenging and costly to implement, and their risk of failure higher, than they would be in a more centralized environment. Depending on the nature of the problem or initiative in question, such failure could materially adversely affect Seaboard\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\n(5)\nOcean Transportation Has Inherent Risks. Seaboard\u2019s owned and chartered vessels along with related cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost because of events such as:\n\u00b7\nbad weather;\n\u00b7\nmechanical failures;\n\u00b7\ngrounding, fire, explosions and collisions;\n\u00b7\nhuman error; and\n\u00b7\nwar, piracy and terrorism.\nAll of these hazards could result in death or injury to persons, loss of property, environmental damages, delays or rerouting. If one of Seaboard\u2019s vessels were involved in an incident, the resulting negative public perception could have a material adverse effect on Seaboard\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, many aspects of the marine industry are subject to extensive governmental regulations. Compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards may require installation of costly equipment or operational changes, while the failure to comply may result in administrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions, the suspension or termination of Seaboard\u2019s operations or detention of its vessels.\n(6)\nFluctuations in Fuel Costs Could Adversely Affect Operating Margins. In addition, fuel expenses are a large expense for the Marine and Power divisions and impacts the CT&M division\u2019s results. Fuel prices can vary greatly from year to year. While such fluctuations may be offset through fuel surcharges or other mechanisms, such mechanisms do not act with precision in terms of timing and amount and may not adjust revenues enough to offset the increase in costs. For the Marine and CT&M divisions the reduced global sulfur emissions cap from 3.5% to 0.5%, effective January 1, 2020, will increase fuel costs or require equipment to clean emissions. Seaboard has not concluded on the cost benefit of adding expensive equipment to the ships it operates.\n(7)\nSeaboard\u2019s Common Stock Is Thinly Traded and Subject to Daily Price Fluctuations. The common stock of Seaboard is closely held and thinly traded on a daily basis on the NYSE American. Seaboard Flour LLC and SFC Preferred, LLC, which are beneficially owned by Mr. Steven Bresky, President and Chief Executive Officer of Seaboard, and other members of the Bresky family, hold approximately 76% of Seaboard\u2019s outstanding common stock. Accordingly, the price of a share of common stock could fluctuate more significantly from day-to-day than that of a share of widely held stock that is actively traded on a daily basis.\nFORM 10-K\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n(8)\nSeaboard Has Investments in Non-Consolidated Affiliates That Are Managed by Third Parties. Seaboard has several equity method investments in which it owns 50% or less, with various third-party business partners owning the remaining equity. Due to the ownership structure of these affiliates, Seaboard does not control all of the decision making processes and could be exposed to various business risks if the business partners\u2019 business decisions do not align with Seaboard\u2019s best interests, which could adversely impact the results for Seaboard\u2019s income (loss) from affiliates.\n(9)\nSeaboard is Increasingly Dependent on Information Technology Systems to Manage and Support a Variety of Business Processes and Activities. Seaboard may be adversely impacted if it is unable to protect its information technology systems against, or effectively respond to, cyber-attacks or cybersecurity breaches. Attempted cyber-attacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. Any significant penetration, invasion, destruction, or interruption of these systems could negatively impact operations and there is a risk of business interruption and reputational damage from the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information and a risk of loss to financial assets related to manipulated electronic communications. This includes additional costs for increased security, system remediation and breach detection. If Seaboard is unable to prevent such breaches or failures, its operations could be disrupted or it could negatively impact its financial condition, results of operations, and the market price of its common stock.\n(b)\nPork Division\n(1)\nFluctuations in Commodity Pork Prices Could Adversely Affect the Results of Operations. Sales prices for this division\u2019s products are directly affected by both domestic and worldwide supply and demand for pork products and other proteins, all of which are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand as well as other factors over which Seaboard has little or no control. Commodity pork prices demonstrate a cyclical nature over periods of years, reflecting changes in the supply of fresh pork and competing proteins on the market, especially beef and chicken. This division\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected by fluctuations in pork commodity prices.\n(2)\nIncreases in Costs of This Division\u2019s Feed Components and Third-Party Hog Purchases Could Adversely Affect Costs and Operating Margins. Feed costs are the most significant single component of the cost of raising hogs and could be materially affected by commodity price fluctuations for corn and soybean meal. The results of this division could be negatively affected by increased costs of its feed components. The continued operation of ethanol plants has elevated this risk as it has increased the competing demand for feed ingredients, primarily corn. Similarly, accounting for approximately 11% of this division\u2019s total hogs slaughtered, the cost of third-party hogs purchased fluctuates with market conditions and could have an impact on this division\u2019s total costs. The cost and supply of feed components and the third-party hogs that this division purchases are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand, which are driven by matters over which Seaboard has no control, including weather, current and projected worldwide grain stocks and prices, grain export prices and supports, and governmental agricultural policies. This division attempts to manage certain of these risks through the use of financial instruments; however, this may also limit its ability to participate in gains from favorable commodity fluctuations. Unless wholesale pork prices correspondingly increase, increases in the prices of this division\u2019s feed components or in the cost of third-party hogs purchased would adversely affect Seaboard\u2019s operating margins.\n(3)\nSeaboard May Be Unable to Obtain Appropriate Personnel at Remote Locations. The remote locations of the pork processing plant and live hog operations and a more restrictive national policy on immigration could negatively affect the availability and cost of labor. This division is dependent on having a sufficient number of properly trained operations personnel. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel is important to this division\u2019s success. The inability to acquire and retain the services of such personnel could have a material adverse effect on Seaboard\u2019s operations.\n(4)\nThe Loss of This Division\u2019s Oklahoma Pork Processing Plant Could Adversely Affect the Business. This division is largely dependent on the continued operation of its Oklahoma pork processing plant. The loss of or damage to this plant for any reason, including fire, tornado or earthquake, or the occurrence of adverse governmental action could adversely affect the business of this division.\n(5)\nEnvironmental Regulation and Related Litigation Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Business. This division\u2019s operations and properties are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent laws and regulations pertaining to, among other things, odors, the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and\nFORM 10-K\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ndisposition of wastes (including solid and hazardous wastes) or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations and any future changes to them could result in significant consequences to Seaboard, including civil and criminal penalties, liability for damages and negative publicity. Some requirements applicable to this division may also be enforced by citizen groups. Seaboard has incurred, and will continue to incur, operating expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations.\n(6)\nHealth Risk to Livestock Could Adversely Affect Production, the Supply of Raw Materials and the Business. Seaboard is subject to risks relating to its ability to maintain animal health and control diseases. The general health of the hogs and the reproductive performance of the sows could have an adverse impact on production and production costs, the supply of raw material to this division\u2019s pork processing operations and consumer confidence. If this division\u2019s hogs are affected by disease, Seaboard could be required to destroy infected livestock, which could adversely affect this division\u2019s production or ability to sell or export its products. Moreover, the herd health of third-party suppliers could adversely affect the supply and cost of hogs available for purchase. Adverse publicity concerning any disease or health concern could also cause customers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of this division\u2019s food products.\n(7)\nInternational Trade Barriers Could Adversely Affect This Division\u2019s Operations. This division realizes a significant portion of its revenues from international markets, particularly Japan, Mexico and China. International sales are subject to risks related to general economic conditions, imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other restrictions, enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and compliance with applicable foreign laws, and other economic and political uncertainties. These and other risks could result in border closings or other international trade barriers having an adverse effect on Seaboard\u2019s earnings.\n(8)\nThe Operating Profit of the Biodiesel Production Facilities Could Be Adversely Impacted by Various Factors. The profitability of this division\u2019s biodiesel plants could be adversely affected by various factors, including the market price of pork fat, other animal fat and vegetable oil, which are utilized to produce biodiesel, and the market price for biodiesel, which is influenced by world oil prices and U.S. government mandates to use biofuels. Unfavorable changes in these prices over extended periods of time or adverse changes in U.S. government mandates to use biofuels could adversely affect this division\u2019s results of operations and could result in the potential impairment of the recorded value of the property, plant and equipment related to these facilities. Also, the Federal blender\u2019s credits are not permanent and may not be renewed.\n(9)\nDifficulties Could Be Experienced in the Start-up of the STF Pork Processing Plant. STF\u2019s new pork processing plant in Sioux City, Iowa, began single-shift operations in September 2017 and second-shift operations in October 2018. Difficulty in hog procurement or other difficulties encountered in the ramp-up of operations could have an adverse effect on results of operations.\n(c)\nCommodity Trading and Milling Division\n(1)\nThis Division Is Subject to Risks Associated with Foreign Operations. This division principally operates in Africa, South America, the Caribbean and Europe and, in most cases, in what are generally regarded to be lesser-developed countries. Many of these foreign operations are subject to risks of doing business in lesser-developed countries, which are subject to potential civil unrest and government instability, increasing the exposure to potential expropriation, confiscation, war, insurrection, civil strife and revolution, corruption, currency inconvertibility and devaluation, and currency exchange controls, in addition to the risks of overseas operations mentioned in clause (a)(2) above. In addition, foreign government policies and regulations could restrict the purchase of various agricultural commodities and commodity products, reducing or limiting this division\u2019s ability to access materials or to limit this division\u2019s sales prices for products sold in local markets.\n(2)\nFluctuations in Commodity Prices Could Adversely Affect the Business of This Division. This division\u2019s sales are significantly affected by fluctuating worldwide prices for various commodities, such as wheat, corn, soybeans, soybean meal and, to a lesser degree, various other agricultural commodity products. These prices are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand, as well as other factors over which Seaboard has little or no control. European flour exports, donated food aid, flour dumping practices and worldwide and local crop production could contribute to these fluctuating market conditions and could have a significant impact on the trading and milling businesses\u2019 sales, value of commodities held in inventory and operating income.\n(3)\nThis Division Uses a Material Amount of Derivative Products to Manage Certain Market Risks. The commodity trading portion of this division enters into various commodity derivative and foreign exchange derivative transactions to create what management believes is an economic hedge for commodity trades it executes or intends\nFORM 10-K\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nto execute with its customers. This portion of the division also enters into speculative derivative transactions related to its market risks. Failure to execute or improper execution of a derivative position or a firmly committed sale or purchase contract or a speculative transaction that closes without the desired result or exposure to counter party risk could have an adverse impact on the results of operations and liquidity.\n(4)\nThis Division Is Subject to Higher Than Normal Risks for Attracting and Retaining Key Personnel. In the commodity trading environment, loss of a key employee such as a commodity trader could have a negative impact resulting from the loss of revenues as personal customer relationships can be vital to obtaining and retaining business with various foreign customers. In the milling portion of this division, employing and retaining qualified expatriate personnel are key elements to success given the difficult living conditions, the unique operating environments and the reliance on a relatively small number of executives to manage each individual location.\n(5)\nThis Division Faces Increasing Competition. This division is experiencing increasing competition in certain foreign markets by well-capitalized originators, traders of commodities making sales directly to end-use customers and industrial-asset owners that compete in the same markets as this division. If various raw-material originators refuse to sell commodities to Seaboard for sale in these foreign markets, it could be more challenging for this division to purchase commodities for sale to its customers at competitive prices. This division\u2019s sales volume and sale prices for commodities to customers, as well as results of operations, could be adversely impacted by such increased competition.\n(d)\nMarine Division\n(1)\nThe Demand for This Division\u2019s Services Are Affected by International Trade and Fluctuating Freight Rates. This division provides cargo shipping services primarily from the U.S. to many different countries in the Caribbean and Central and South America. In addition to the risks of overseas operations mentioned in (a)(2) above, fluctuations in economic conditions and unstable or hostile local political situations in the countries in which this division operates could affect trade volumes and cargo freight rates, as well as adversely affect this division\u2019s results of operations.\n(2)\nChartered Ships Are Subject to Fluctuating Rates. Time-charter expenses are one of this division\u2019s largest expenses. Certain ships are under charters longer than one year while others are less than one year. These costs can vary greatly due to a number of factors including the worldwide supply and demand for shipping. It is not possible to determine in advance whether a charter contract for more or less than one year will be favorable to this division\u2019s business. Accordingly, entering into either long-term charter hire contracts during periods of decreasing charter hire costs or short-term charter hire contracts during periods of increasing charter hire costs could have an adverse effect on this division\u2019s results of operations.\n(3)\nHurricanes May Disrupt Operations. This division\u2019s port operations can be subject to disruption due to hurricanes, especially at this division\u2019s major ports in Miami, Florida and Houston, Texas, which could have an adverse effect on this division\u2019s results of operations.\n(4)\nThis Division Is Subject to Complex Laws and Regulations That May Adversely Affect the Revenues, Cost, Manner or Feasibility of Doing Business. Federal, state and local laws and domestic and international regulations governing worker health and safety, environmental protection, port and terminal security, and the operation of vessels, including fuel regulations, significantly affect this division\u2019s operations, including rate discussions and other related arrangements. Many aspects of the marine industry, including rate agreements and vessel cost sharing agreements, are subject to extensive governmental regulation by the Federal Maritime Commission, the U.S. Coast Guard, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, as well as regulation by private industry organizations. Compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards may require installation of costly equipment or operational changes, while the failure to comply may result in administrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions, the suspension or termination of Seaboard\u2019s operations or detention of its vessels. In addition, future changes in laws, regulations and standards, including allowed freight rate discussions and other related arrangements, may result in additional costs or a reduction in revenues.\n(5)\nThis Division\u2019s Revenues and Cost Structure Are Dependent on the Continuation of Cost Sharing Arrangements. The division has entered into vessel cost sharing arrangements with other service providers that are short term in nature. If they are unable to be renewed or renewed with unfavorable terms it could result in a negative impact to the business.\nFORM 10-K\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n(e)\nSugar and Alcohol Division\n(1)\nThe Success of This Division Depends on the Condition of the Argentine Economy, Currency and Political Climate. This division operates a sugar mill, alcohol production and power generation facility in Argentina, locally growing a substantial portion of the sugarcane processed at the mill. Fluctuations in economic conditions or changes in the Argentine political climate could have an impact on the costs of operations, the sales prices of products, export opportunities and the exchange rate of the Argentine peso to the U.S. dollar. In this regard, local sales prices for bioethanol are affected by government price control and domestic prices for sugar are affected by import duties imposed by the Argentine government, impacting local volume sold, as well as imported and exported volumes to and from international markets. If import duties are changed, this could have a negative impact on this division\u2019s sales prices of its products. In addition, the majority of this division\u2019s sales are within Argentina, and any Argentine government attempts to control inflation through retail price controls on mass consumption products, including sugar, could adversely impact the local sales prices of this division\u2019s products and the results of operations for this division. In the second quarter of 2018, Argentina was determined to be a highly inflationary economy. A devaluation of the Argentine peso would have a negative impact on this division\u2019s financial position.\n(2)\nThis Division Is Subject to the Risks That Are Inherent in any Agricultural Business. Seaboard\u2019s results of operations for this division may be adversely affected by numerous factors over which Seaboard has little or no control and that are inherent in any agricultural business, including reductions in the market prices for this division\u2019s products, adverse weather and growing conditions, pest and disease problems, and new government regulations regarding agriculture and the marketing of agricultural products. Of these risks, weather particularly could adversely affect the amount and quality of the sugarcane produced by this division and its competitors located in other regions of Argentina.\n(3)\nThe Loss of This Division\u2019s Sole Processing Facility Would Adversely Affect the Business. This division is largely dependent on the continued operation of a single sugar mill. The loss of or damage to this mill for any reason, including fire, tornado or earthquake, or the occurrence of adverse governmental action or labor unrest resulting in labor strikes would adversely affect the business of this division.\n(4)\nLabor Relations Challenges Could Adversely Affect Operations. This division is dependent on unionized labor at its single sugar mill in Argentina. The political and economic environment in Argentina makes normal labor relations very challenging. Contributing to the situation are the historical policies of Argentina\u2019s government and the failure of the Argentine courts to enforce contractual obligations with unions and basic property rights. Interruptions in production as a result of labor unrest could adversely impact the quantity of sugarcane harvested and the amount of sugar, alcohol and power produced and could interfere with the distribution of products stored at the facility.\n(5)\nThe Operating Profit of the Alcohol Production Facility Could Be Adversely Impacted by Government Regulations. The profitability of this division\u2019s alcohol production facility could be adversely affected by Argentine government regulations regarding production quotas, fuel blends and sales prices in the bio-ethanol market. In addition, corn alcohol producers in Argentina have increased competition in the bio-ethanol market. Adverse changes in the Argentine government\u2019s regulations regarding bio-ethanol production quotas and fuel blends could adversely affect this division\u2019s results of operations.\n(6)\nThe Operating Profit of the Cogeneration Power Plant Could Be Adversely Impacted by Contract for the Sale of Energy. The sale price for energy produced and sold by this division\u2019s cogeneration power plant is based on a biomass cogeneration contract with the Argentine government. The profitability of the cogeneration power plant could be adversely affected by this division\u2019s failure to enforce the terms of the contract, which could adversely affect this division\u2019s results of operations and could result in the potential impairment of the recorded value of the property, plant and equipment related to this facility.\nFORM 10-K\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n(f)\nPower Division\n(1)\nThis Division is Subject to Risks of Doing Business in the Dominican Republic. In addition to significant currency fluctuations and the other risks of overseas operations mentioned in clause (a)(2) above, this division could experience difficulty in obtaining timely collections of trade receivables from the government owned distribution companies or other companies that must also collect from the government in order to make payments on their accounts. Currently, the Dominican Republic does not allow a free market to enable prices to rise with demand, which could limit this division\u2019s profitability. The government has the ability to arbitrarily decide which power units will be able to operate, which can ultimately determine spot market prices for electricity generated and sold into the power grid and, therefore, could have adverse effects on results of operations.\n(2)\nSupply of Natural Gas is Limited in the Dominican Republic. Supply of natural gas in the Dominican Republic is limited to one primary supplier. Although the barge can run on other types of fuel, supply disruptions of natural gas could have a negative impact on this division\u2019s operating income.\n(3)\nThe Loss of This Division\u2019s Sole Facility Would Adversely Affect the Business. This division is dependent on the continued operation of a single facility. The loss of or damage to this facility for any reason, including fire, hurricane, tornado or earthquake, or the occurrence of adverse governmental actions or labor unrest resulting in labor strikes would adversely affect the business of this division.\n(g)\nTurkey Segment\n(1)\nFluctuations in Commodity Turkey Prices Could Adversely Affect the Results of Operations. Sales prices for turkey products are directly affected by both domestic and worldwide supply and demand for turkey products and other proteins, which are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand as well as other factors over which Butterball has little or no control. Butterball\u2019s results of operations and the value of Seaboard\u2019s investment in Butterball could be adversely affected by fluctuations in turkey commodity prices.\n(2)\nIncreases in Costs of Butterball\u2019s Feed Components and Turkey Purchases Could Adversely Affect Costs and Operating Margins. Feed costs are the most significant single component of the cost of raising turkeys and could be materially affected by commodity price fluctuations for corn, soybean meal and other commodity grain inputs. Butterball\u2019s results may be negatively affected by increased costs of the feed components. Butterball attempts to manage some of these risks through the use of financial instruments; however this may also limit its ability to participate in gains from favorable commodity fluctuations. Unless wholesale turkey prices correspondingly increase, increases in the prices of Butterball\u2019s feed components would adversely affect Butterball\u2019s results of operations and the value of Seaboard\u2019s investment in Butterball.\n(3)\nAdverse Operating Results Could Result in Need for Additional Investment. Butterball has third-party bank loan facilities that are secured by substantially all of the assets of Butterball. Adverse operating results could cause Butterball to default on such loan facilities, which could result in a significant adverse impact on Butterball\u2019s financial position, or result in Seaboard needing to increase its investment or provide financing to Butterball.\n(4)\nDecreased Perception of Value in the Butterball Brand Could Adversely Affect Sales Quantity and Price of Butterball Products. Butterball is a premium brand name, built on a long history of offering a quality product that has been differentiated in the market. The value of the Butterball brand allows for sales of a higher unit price than other turkey products. In order to maintain this advantage, Butterball must continue to support the brand with successful marketing efforts. In addition, negative news reports for any reason related to the company or the turkey/poultry industry could negatively impact this brand perception, Butterball\u2019s results of operations and the value of Seaboard\u2019s investment in Butterball.\n(5)\nThe Loss of Butterball\u2019s Primary Further Processing Facility Could Adversely Affect Butterball\u2019s Business. Although Butterball has four processing plants and two further processing plants, Butterball is disproportionately dependent on the continued operation of the processing plant in Mt. Olive, North Carolina, that handles a significant volume of the production of further processed turkey products. The loss of or damage to this plant for any reason, including fire, hurricane or tornado or the occurrence of an adverse governmental action could adversely affect the results of operations for Butterball and the value of Seaboard\u2019s investment in Butterball.\nFORM 10-K\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nSEABOARD CORPORATION\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n(6)\nHealth Risk to Poultry Could Adversely Affect Production, the Supply of Raw Materials and Butterball\u2019s Business. Butterball is subject to risks relating to its ability to maintain animal health and control diseases, such as avian influenza. The general health of the turkeys and reproductive performance could have an adverse impact on production and production costs, the supply of raw material to Butterball\u2019s processing operations and consumer confidence. If Butterball\u2019s turkeys are affected by disease, Butterball may be required to destroy infected birds, which could adversely affect Butterball\u2019s production or ability to sell or export its products. Adverse publicity concerning any disease or health concern could also cause customers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of Butterball products, resulting in an adverse effect on Butterball\u2019s results of operations and the value of Seaboard\u2019s investment in Butterball.\n(7)\nButterball May Be Unable to Obtain Appropriate Personnel at Remote Locations. The remote locations of some of Butterball\u2019s processing plants and live turkey operations, along with a more restrictive national policy on immigration, could negatively affect the availability and cost of labor. Butterball is dependent on having sufficient properly trained operations personnel. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel is important to Butterball\u2019s success. The inability to acquire and retain the services of such personnel could have a material adverse effect on Butterball\u2019s operations and the value of Seaboard\u2019s investment in Butterball.", "PERMNO": 36281, "SIC": 9997, "TIC": "SEB"}
