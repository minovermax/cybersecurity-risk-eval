{"cik": "1596961", "company": "RumbleON, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-05-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and related notes and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" before deciding to invest in our common stock. If any of the events or developments described below occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially or adversely affected. As a result, the market price of our common stock could decline, and investors could lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a limited operating history and we cannot assure you we will achieve or maintain profitability.\nOur business model is unproven, and we have a limited operating history. We are only in the initial development stage of our business. We expect to make significant investments in the further development and expansion of our business and these investments may not result in the successful development, operation, or growth of our business on a timely basis or at all. We may not generate sufficient revenue and we may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including a lack of demand for our products and services, increasing competition, weakness in the automotive, powersports and recreational vehicle industries generally, as well as other risks described in these Risk Factors, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays, and other unknown factors relating to the development and operation of our business. Accordingly, we may not be able to successfully develop and operate our business, generate revenue, or achieve or maintain profitability.\nOur annual and quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly or may fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, each of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to annual and quarterly fluctuations, and they will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u25cf\na change in consumer discretionary spending;\n\u25cf\na shift in the mix and type of vehicles we sell which could result in lower sales price and lower gross profit;\n\u25cf\nweather, which may impact the ability or desire for potential end customers to consider whether they wish to own a powersports and recreational vehicle;\n\u25cf\nthe timing and cost of, and level of investment in, development activities relating to our software development and services, which may change from time to time;\n\u25cf\nour ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel;\n\u25cf\nexpenditures that we will or may incur to acquire or develop additional product and service offerings;\n\u25cf\nfuture accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies; and\n\u25cf\nthe changing and volatile U.S., European and global economic environments.\nIf our annual or quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our Class B Common Stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any annual or quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that annual and quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nThe initial development and progress of our business to date may not be indicative of our future growth prospects and, if we continue to grow rapidly, we may not be able to manage our growth effectively.\nWe expect that, in the future, as our revenue increases, our rate of growth will decline. In addition, we will not be able to grow as fast or at all if we do not accomplish the following:\n\u25cf\nmaintain and grow our regional partner network;\n\u25cf\nincrease the number of users of our products and services, and in particular the number of unique visitors to our website and our branded mobile applications;\n\u25cf\nincrease the number of transactions between our users and both RumbleOn and our regional partners;\n\u25cf\nintroduce third party ancillary products and services;\n\u25cf\nacquire sufficient number of pre-owned vehicles at attractive cost; and\n\u25cf\nsell sufficient number of pre-owned vehicles at acceptable prices.\nWe may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. We plan to continue our investment in future growth. We expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on:\n\u25cf\nmarketing and advertising;\n\u25cf\nproduct and service development; including investments in our website, business processes, infrastructure, inventory, product and service development team and the development of new products and services and new features for existing products; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral administration, including legal, accounting and other compliance expenses related to being a public company.\nIn addition, our anticipated growth may place and may continue to place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial resources. As we grow, we expect to hire additional personnel. Also, our organizational structure will become more complex as we add additional staff, and we will need to ensure we adequately develop and maintain operational, financial and management controls as well as our reporting systems and procedures.\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 were prepared under the assumption that we would continue our operations as a going concern, which assumes the continuity of operations, the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities as they come due in the normal course of business. Our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2019 included a \u201cgoing concern\u201d paragraph in its report on our financial statements as of, and for the year ended December 31, 2019, indicating that the Company has incurred recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows from operations, and these conditions, along with the uncertainty arising from the impact of COVID-19 and other matters set forth in Note 1 to our audited financial statements, raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient liquidity from the actions taken in respect of the COVID-19 pandemic, current working capital, results of operations, and expected continued inventory financing, there is no assurance that sufficient financing will be available to us when needed to allow us to continue as a going concern.\nWe may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances. If capital is not available on terms acceptable to us or at all, we may not be able to develop and grow our business as anticipated and our business, operating results and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support the development and growth of our business and, we may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. However, additional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Volatility in the credit markets may also have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt financing. Also, the incurrence of leverage, the debt service requirements resulting therefrom, and the possibility of a need for financing or any additional financing could have important and negative consequences, including the following: (a) the Company's ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate or other purposes may be impaired in the future; (b) certain future borrowings may be at variable rates of interest, which will expose the Company to the risk of increased interest rates; (c) the Company may need to use a portion of the money it earns to pay principal and interest on their credit facilities, which will reduce the amount of money available to finance operations and other business activities, repay other indebtedness, and pay distributions; and (d) substantial leverage may limit the Company's flexibility to adjust to changing economic or market conditions, reduce their ability to withstand competitive pressures and make them more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions.\nIf we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to pursue our business objectives and to respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly limited, and our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe may fail to maintain our listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market.\nOur Class B Common Stock is listed for trading on NASDAQ under the trading symbol \"RMBL\" For our Class B Common Stock to continue to be listed on NASDAQ, we must meet NASDAQ's continued listing standards. A failure to meet these standards, including our failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement, could result in our Class B Common Stock being delisted, which could adversely affect the market liquidity of our Class B Common Stock, impair the value of your investment, and harm our business. We can provide no assurance that we will continue to satisfy NASDAQ's continued listing standards and maintain our listing on NASDAQ.\nThe success of our business relies heavily on our marketing and branding efforts, especially with respect to the RumbleOn website and our branded mobile applications, and these efforts may not be successful.\nWe believe that an important component of our development and growth will be the business derived from the RumbleOn website and our branded mobile applications. Because RumbleOn is a consumer brand, we rely heavily on marketing and advertising to increase the visibility of this brand with potential users of our products and services.\nOur business model relies on our ability to scale rapidly and to decrease incremental user acquisition costs as we grow. Some of our methods of marketing and advertising may not be profitable because they may not result in the acquisition of sufficient users visiting our website and mobile applications such that we may recover these costs by attaining corresponding revenue growth. If we are unable to recover our marketing and advertising costs through increases in user traffic and in the number of transactions by users of our platform, it could have a material adverse effect on our growth, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe failure to develop and maintain our brand could harm our ability to grow unique visitor traffic and to expand our regional partner network.\nDeveloping and maintaining the RumbleOn brand will depend largely on the success of our efforts to maintain the trust of our users and dealers and to deliver value to each of our users and dealers. If our potential users perceive that we are not focused primarily on providing them with a better pre-owned vehicle buying experience, our reputation and the strength of our brand will be adversely affected.\nComplaints or negative publicity about our business practices, our marketing and advertising campaigns, our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the integrity of the data that we provide to users, data privacy and security issues, and other aspects of our business, irrespective of their validity, could diminish users' and dealers' confidence in and the use of our products and services and adversely affect our brand. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop, maintain or enhance our brand, and failure to do so would harm our business growth prospects and operating results.\nWe rely on Internet search engines to drive traffic to our website, and if we fail to appear prominently in the search results, our traffic would decline, and our business would be adversely affected.\nWe depend in part on Internet search engines and social media such as Google\u2122, Bing\u2122, and Facebook\u2122 to drive traffic to our website. For example, when a user searches the internet for a particular type of powersports or recreational vehicle, we will rely on a high organic search ranking of our webpages in these search results to refer the user to our website. However, our ability to maintain high, non-paid search result rankings is not within our control. Our competitors' Internet search engine and social media efforts may result in their websites receiving a higher search result page ranking than ours, or Internet search engines could revise their methodologies in a way that would adversely affect our search result rankings. If Internet search engines or social media companies modify their search algorithms or display technologies in ways that are detrimental to us, or if our competitors' efforts are more successful than ours, overall growth in our user base could slow or our user base could decline. Internet search engine providers could provide recreation vehicle dealer and pricing information directly in search results, align with our competitors or choose to develop competing services. Any reduction in the number of users directed to our website through Internet search engines could harm our business and operating results.\nA significant disruption in service on our website or of our mobile applications could damage our reputation and result in a loss of consumers, which could harm our business, brand, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur brand, reputation and ability to attract consumers, affinity groups and advertisers depend on the reliable performance of our technology infrastructure and content delivery. We may experience significant interruptions with our systems in the future. Interruptions in these systems, whether due to system failures, computer viruses, or physical or electronic break-ins, could affect the security or availability of our products on our website and mobile application, and prevent or inhibit the ability of consumers to access our products. Problems with the reliability or security of our systems could harm our reputation, result in a loss of consumers, dealers and affinity group marketing partners, and result in additional costs.\nWe intend to locate our communications, network, and computer hardware used to operate our website and mobile applications at facilities in various parts of the country to minimize the risk and create an environment where we can remain online if one of the facilities in which our equipment is housed goes offline. Nevertheless, we will not own or control the operation of these facilities, and our systems and operations will be vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, acts of war, electronic and physical break-ins, computer viruses, earthquakes, and similar events. The occurrence of any of these events could result in damage to our systems and hardware or could cause them to fail.\nProblems faced by any third-party web hosting providers we may utilize could adversely affect the experience of our consumers. Any third-party web hosting providers could close their facilities without adequate notice. Any financial difficulties, up to and including bankruptcy, faced by any third-party web hosting providers or any of the service providers with whom they contract may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict. If our third-party web hosting providers are unable to keep up with our growing capacity needs, our business could be harmed.\nAny errors, defects, disruptions, or other performance or reliability problems with our network operations could cause interruptions in access to our products as well as delays and additional expense in arranging new facilities and services and could harm our reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to maintain or grow relationships with information data providers or may experience interruptions in the data feeds they provide, which may limit the information that we are able to provide to our users and regional partners as well as adversely affect the timeliness of such information and may impair our ability to attract or retain consumers and our regional partners and to timely invoice all parties.\nWe expect to receive data from third-party data providers, including our partner network, dealer management system data feed providers, data aggregators and integrators, survey companies, purveyors of registration data and possibly others. There may be some instances in which we use this information to collect a transaction fee from those dealers and recognize revenue from the related transactions.\nFrom time to time, we may experience interruptions in one or more data feeds that we receive from third-party data providers, in a manner that affects our ability to operate our business. These interruptions may occur for a number of reasons, including changes to the software used by these data feed providers and difficulties in renewing our agreements with third-party data feed providers. Additionally, when an interruption ceases, we may not always be able to collect the appropriate fees and any such shortfall in revenue could be material to our operating results.\nIf we are unable to provide a compelling vehicle buying experience to our users, the number of transactions between our users, RumbleOn and dealers will decline, and our revenue and results of operations will suffer harm.\nWe cannot assure you that we are able to provide a compelling vehicle buying experience to our users, and our failure to do so will mean that the number of transactions between our users, RumbleOn and dealers will decline, and we will be unable to effectively monetize our user traffic. We believe that our ability to provide a compelling powersport and recreation vehicle buying experience is subject to a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nour ability to launch new products that are effective and have a high degree of consumer engagement; and\n\u25cf\ncompliance of our network partners with applicable laws, regulations and the rules of our platform.\nIf key industry participants, including powersports and recreation vehicle dealers and regional auctions, perceive us in a negative light or our relationships with them suffer harm, our ability to operate and grow our business and our financial performance may be damaged.\nWe anticipate that we will derive a significant portion of our revenue from by existing vehicle dealers for dealer services we may provide them. In addition, we utilize a select set of regional partners to perform services for our benefit, including, among other things, vehicle reconditioning, vehicle storage and vehicle photography. If our relationships with our network of regional partners suffer harm in a manner that leads to the departure of these regional partners from our network, then our ability to operate our business, grow revenue, and lower our costs will be adversely affected.\nWe cannot assure you that we will maintain strong relationships with the regional partners in our network or that we will not suffer partner attrition in the future. We may also have disputes with regional partners from time to time, including relating to the collection of fees from them and other matters. We may need to modify our products, change pricing or take other actions to address regional partner concerns in the future. If we are unable to create and maintain a compelling value proposition for regional partners to become and remain in our network, our network will not grow and may begin to decline. If a significant number of these regional partners decided to leave our network or change their financial or business relationship with us, then our business, growth, operating results, financial condition and prospects could suffer. Additionally, if we are unable to attract regional partners to our network, our growth could be impaired.\nThe growth of our business relies significantly on our ability to increase the number of regional partners in our network such that we are able to increase the number of transactions between our users and regional partners. Failure to do so would limit our growth.\nOur ability to grow the number of regional partners in our network is an important factor in growing our business. We may be viewed in a negative light by vehicle dealers, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or grow the number of regional partners in our network.\nOur ability to grow our complementary product offerings may be limited, which could negatively impact our development, growth, revenue and financial performance.\nAs we introduce or expand additional offerings for our platform, such as recreation vehicle trade-ins, lead management, transaction processing, financing, maintenance and insurance, we may incur losses or otherwise fail to enter these markets successfully. Our expansion into these markets may place us in competitive and regulatory environments with which we are unfamiliar and involves various risks, including the need to invest significant resources and the possibility that returns on such investments will not be achieved for several years, if at all. In attempting to establish such new product offerings, we may incur significant expenses and face various other challenges, such as expanding our sales force and management personnel to cover these markets and complying with complicated regulations that apply to these markets. In addition, we may not successfully demonstrate the value of these ancillary products to consumers or dealers, and failure to do so would compromise our ability to successfully expand into these additional revenue streams.\nWe rely on third-party financing providers to finance a portion of our customers' vehicle purchases.\nWe rely on third-party financing providers to finance a portion of our customers' vehicle purchases. Accordingly, our revenue and results of operations are partially dependent on the actions of these third parties. We provide financing to qualified customers through a number of third-party financing providers. If one or more of these third-party providers cease to provide financing to our customers, provide financing to fewer customers or no longer provide financing on competitive terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations. Additionally, if we were unable to replace the current third-party providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events, it could also have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations. We rely on third-party providers to supply EPP products to our customers. Accordingly, our revenue and results of operations will be partially dependent on the actions of these third-parties. If one or more of these third-party providers cease to provide EPP products, make changes to their products or no longer provide their products on competitive terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue and results of operations. Additionally, if we were unable to replace the current third-party providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events, it could also have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue and results of operations.\nOur sales of powersports/recreation vehicles may be adversely impacted by increased supply of and/or declining prices for pre-owned vehicles and excess supply of new vehicles.\nWe believe when prices for pre-owned vehicles have declined, it can have the effect of reducing demand among retail purchasers for new vehicles (at or near manufacturer's suggested retail prices). Further, vehicle manufacturers can and do take actions that influence the markets for new and pre-owned vehicles. For example, introduction of new models with significantly different functionality, technology or other customer satisfiers can result in increased supply of pre-owned vehicles, and a corresponding decrease in price of pre-owned vehicles. Also, while historically manufacturers have taken steps designed to balance production volumes for new vehicles with demand, those steps have not always proven effective. In other instances, manufacturers have chosen to supply new vehicles to the market in excess of demand at reduced prices which has the effect of reducing demand for pre-owned vehicles.\nWe rely on a number of third parties to perform certain operating and administrative functions for the Company.\nWe rely on a number of third parties to perform certain operating and administrative functions for us. We may experience problems with outsourced services, such as unfavorable pricing, untimely delivery of services, or poor quality. Also, these third parties may experience adverse economic conditions due to difficulties in the global economy that could lead to difficulties supporting our operations. In light of the amount and types of functions that we will outsource, these service provider risks could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe participate in a highly competitive market, and pressure from existing and new companies may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe face significant competition from companies that provide listings, information, lead generation, and vehicle buying services designed to reach consumers and enable dealers to reach these consumers. We will compete for a share of overall vehicle purchases as well as vehicle dealer's marketing and technology spend. To the extent that vehicle dealers view alternative strategies to be superior to RumbleOn, we may not be able to maintain or grow the number of dealers in our network, we may sell fewer vehicles to users of our platform, and our business, operating results and financial condition will be harmed.\nWe also expect that new competitors will continue to enter the online vehicle retail industry with competing products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue, business and financial results.\nOur competitors could significantly impede our ability to expand our network of dealers and regional auctions and to reach consumers. Our competitors may also develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future products and services less competitive, unmarketable or obsolete. In addition, if our competitors develop products or services with similar or superior functionality to our solutions, we may need to decrease the prices for our solutions in order to remain competitive. If we are unable to maintain our current pricing structure due to competitive pressures, our revenue will be reduced, and our operating results will be negatively affected.\nOur current and potential competitors may have significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have, and the ability to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and support of their products and services. Additionally, they may have more extensive recreation vehicle industry relationships than we have, longer operating histories and greater name recognition. As a result, these competitors may be better able to respond more quickly to undertake more extensive marketing or promotional campaigns. If we are unable to compete with these companies, the demand for our products and services could substantially decline.\nIn addition, if one or more of our competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Our competitors may also establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future third-party data providers, technology partners, or other parties with whom we may have relationships, thereby limiting our ability to develop, improve, and promote our solutions. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors, and competitive pressures may harm our revenue, business and financial results.\nSeasonality or weather trends may cause fluctuations in our unique visitors, revenue and operating results.\nOur revenue trends are likely to be a reflection of consumers' vehicle buying patterns. While different types of recreation vehicles are designed for different seasons (motorcycles are typically for non-snow seasons, while snowmobiles are typically designed for winter), our revenue may be cyclical if, for example, powersport and recreation vehicles represent a large percentage of our revenue. Historically, the used vehicle industry has been seasonal with traffic and sales strongest in the spring and summer quarters. Sales and traffic are typically slowest in the fall quarter but increase in February and March, coinciding with tax refund season. Our business will also be impacted by cyclical trends affecting the overall economy, as well as by actual or threatened severe weather events.\nWe collect, process, store, share, disclose and use personal information and other data, and our actual or perceived failure to protect such information and data could damage our reputation and brand and harm our business and operating results.\nWe collect, process, store, share, disclose and use personal information and other data provided by consumers, dealers and auctions. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to effect secure transmission of such information. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. Any failure or perceived failure to maintain the security of personal and other data that is provided to us by consumers and dealers could harm our reputation and brand and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, any of which could harm our business and operating results. In addition, from time to time, it is possible that concerns will be expressed about whether our products, services, or processes compromise the privacy of our users. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could harm our business and operating results.\nThere are numerous federal, state and local laws around the world regarding privacy and the collection, processing, storing, sharing, disclosing, using and protecting of personal information and other data, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and which may be costly to comply with and may be inconsistent between countries and jurisdictions or conflict with other rules. We generally comply with industry standards and are subject to the terms of our privacy policies and privacy-related obligations to third parties. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection, to the extent possible. However, it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in new ways or in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices or that new regulations could be enacted. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to consumers or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of sensitive information, which may include personally identifiable information or other user data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause consumers and vehicle dealers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if vendors, developers or other third parties that we work with violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also put consumer or dealer information at risk and could in turn harm our reputation, business and operating results.\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm our business and operating results.\nA portion of our success may be dependent on our intellectual property, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our business. We expect to rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property. In addition, we will attempt to protect our intellectual property, technology, and confidential information by requiring our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements and third parties to enter into nondisclosure agreements. These agreements may not effectively prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property, or technology and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property, or technology. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our website features, software, and functionality or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary.\nCompetitors may adopt service names similar to ours, thereby harming our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to user confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of the term \"RumbleOn\" or \"RMBL.\"\nWe currently hold the \"RumbleOn.com\" Internet domain name and various other related domain names. The regulation of domain names in the United States is subject to change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars, or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may not be able to acquire or maintain all domain names that use the name RumbleOn or RMBL.\nWe may in the future be subject to intellectual property disputes, which are costly to defend and could harm our business and operating results.\nWe may from time to time face allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including from our competitors or non-practicing entities.\nPatent and other intellectual property litigation may be protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict and may require us to stop offering some features, purchase licenses or modify our products and features while we develop non-infringing substitutes or may result in significant settlement costs.\nIn addition, we use open source software in our products and will use open source software in the future. From time to time, we may face claims against companies that incorporate open source software into their products, claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the source code, the open source software or derivative works that were developed using such software, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could also result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly license or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our platform or services, any of which would have a negative effect on our business and operating results.\nEven if these matters do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, these matters, and the time and resources necessary to litigate or resolve them, could harm our business, our operating results and our reputation.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations. Our sale and purchase of pre-owned vehicles and related activities, including the sale of complementary products and services, are subject to state and local licensing requirements, federal and state laws regulating advertising of vehicles and related products and services, state laws related to title and registration and state laws regulating the sale of vehicles and related products and services. The applicability of these regulatory and legal compliance obligations is dependent on the evolving interpretations of these laws and regulations and how our operations are, or are not, subject to them. The financing we resell customers is subject to federal and state laws regulating the provision of consumer finance. Our facilities and business operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and health and safety. In addition to these laws and regulations that apply specifically to our business, we are also subject to laws and regulations affecting public companies, including securities laws and Nasdaq listing rules. The violation of any of these laws or regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties or in a cease-and-desist order against our business operations, any of which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenses and other costs to comply with these laws and regulations.\nWe currently provide transportation services and rely upon third-party logistics and transportation providers to move vehicles between and among customers, our distribution network partners and auction partners; we and these transportation providers are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the United States Department of Transportation (the \"DOT\") and individual states through which our vehicles travel, which have broad administrative powers with respect to our logistics operations. Vehicle dimensions, driver alcohol and drug testing and driver hours of service are also subject to both federal and state regulation. More restrictive limitations on vehicle weight and size, trailer length and configuration, methods of measurement, driver qualifications or driver hours of service would increase our costs, and if we are unable to pass these cost increases on to our customers, our operating expenses may increase and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. If we or our providers fail to comply with the DOT regulations or regulations become more stringent, we could be subject to increased inspections, audits or compliance burdens. Regulatory authorities could take remedial action including imposing fines or shutting down our operations. If any of these events occur, our financial condition, operating results and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nOur sale of pre-owned vehicles, related products and services and third-party finance products is subject to the state and local licensing requirements of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Regulators of jurisdictions where our customers reside but in which we do not have a dealer or financing license could require that we obtain a license or otherwise comply with various state regulations. Despite our belief that we are not subject to the licensing requirements of those jurisdictions, regulators may seek to impose punitive fines for operating without a license or demand we seek a license in those jurisdictions, any of which may inhibit our ability to do business in those jurisdictions, increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe foregoing description of laws and regulations to which we are or may be subject is not exhaustive, and the regulatory framework governing our operations is subject to evolving interpretations and continuous change.\nWe provide transportation services and rely on external logistics to transport vehicles. Thus, we are subject to business risks and costs associated with the transportation industry. Many of these risks and costs are out of our control, and any of them could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe provide transportation services and rely on external logistics to transport vehicles between and among customers or distribution network providers, and auction partners. As a result, we are exposed to risks associated with the transportation industry such as weather, traffic patterns, gasoline prices, recalls affecting our vehicle fleet, local and federal regulations, vehicular crashes, insufficient internal capacity, rising prices of external transportation vendors, fuel prices, taxes, license and registration fees, insurance premiums, self-insurance levels, difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified drivers, disruption of our technology systems, and increasing equipment and operational costs. Our failure to successfully manage our logistics and fulfillment process could cause a disruption in our inventory supply chain and distribution, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe depend on key personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain, attract and integrate qualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmed.\nWe believe our success will depend on the efforts and talents of our executives and employees, including Marshall Chesrown, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Steven R. Berrard, our Chief Financial Officer. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. In addition, the loss of any of our senior management or key employees could materially adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and strategy, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements on a timely basis, or at all. Our executive officers are at-will employees, which means they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may acquire other companies or technologies, which could divert our management's attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to grow our business in response to the demands of consumers, dealers and other constituents within the vehicle industry as well as competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may determine to do so through the acquisition of complementary businesses and technologies rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions. The risks we face in connection with acquisitions include:\n\u25cf\ndiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges;\n\u25cf\ncoordination of technology, research and development and sales and marketing functions;\n\u25cf\ntransition of the acquired company's users to our website and mobile applications;\n\u25cf\nretention of employees from the acquired company;\n\u25cf\ncultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;\n\u25cf\nintegration of the acquired company's accounting, management information, human resources, and other administrative systems;\n\u25cf\nthe need to implement or improve controls, procedures, and policies at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked effective controls, procedures, and policies;\n\u25cf\npotential write-offs of intangibles or other assets acquired in such transactions that may have an adverse effect on our operating results in a given period;\n\u25cf\nliability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n\u25cf\nlitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, consumers, former stockholders, or other third parties.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally. Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses, or the impairment of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. Also, the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions may not materialize to the extent we anticipate or at all.\nThe recent outbreak of COVID-19 will likely have a significant negative impact on our business, sales, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 has led to severe disruptions in general economic activities, particularly retail operations, as businesses and federal, state, and local governments take increasingly broad actions to mitigate this public health crisis. We have experienced significant disruption to our business, both in terms of disruption of our operations and the adverse effect on overall economic conditions. These conditions will significantly negatively impact all aspects of our business. Our business is also dependent on the continued health and productivity of our associates throughout this crisis. Individually and collectively, we expect the consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak will likely have a significant negative impact on our business, sales, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nAdditionally, our liquidity could be negatively impacted if these conditions continue for a significant period of time and we may be required to pursue additional sources of financing to obtain working capital, maintain appropriate inventory levels, and meet our financial obligations. Currently capital and credit markets have been disrupted by the crisis and our ability to obtain any required financing is not guaranteed and largely dependent upon evolving market conditions and other factors.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak ultimately impacts our business, sales, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, we may continue to experience significant impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including any economic downturn or recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.\nRisks Related to the Acquisitions (the \"Acquisitions\") of Wholesale and Wholesale Express (collectively, the \"Wholesale Entities\").\nWe may be unable to realize the anticipated synergies related to the Acquisitions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect to realize significant synergies related to the Acquisitions. We also expect to incur costs to achieve these synergies. While we believe these synergies are achievable, our ability to achieve such estimated synergies in the amounts and timeframe expected is subject to various assumptions by our management based on expectations that are subject to a number of risks, which may or may not be realized, as well as the incurrence of other costs in our operations that may offset all or a portion of such synergies and other factors outside our control. As a consequence, we may not be able to realize all of these synergies within the time frame expected or at all, or the amounts of such synergies could be significantly reduced. In addition, we may incur additional and unexpected costs to realize these synergies. Failure to achieve the expected synergies could significantly reduce the expected benefits associated with the Acquisitions and adversely affect our business.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate the Wholesale Entities' business and realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisitions.\nAs a result of the Acquisitions, we are required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business and operations of Wholesale. Potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include the following:\n\u25cf\nthe inability to successfully combine our business and the businesses of Wholesale in a manner that results in the anticipated benefits and synergies of the Acquisitions not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;\n\u25cf\nthe loss of sales, customers or business partners of ours or of the Wholesale Entities' as a result of such parties deciding not to continue business at the same or similar levels with us or the Wholesale Entities after the Acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nchallenges associated with operating the combined business in markets and geographies in which we do not currently operate;\n\u25cf\ndifficulty integrating our direct sales and distribution channels with the Wholesale Entities' to effectively sell the vehicles of the combined company;\n\u25cf\nthe complexities associated with managing our company and integrating personnel from the Wholesale Entities, resulting in a significantly larger combined company, while at the same time providing high quality services to customers;\n\u25cf\nunanticipated issues in coordinating accounting, information technology, communications, administration and other systems;\n\u25cf\ndifficulty addressing possible differences in corporate culture and management philosophies;\n\u25cf\nthe failure to retain key employees of ours or of the Wholesale Entities;\n\u25cf\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the Acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nperformance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management's attention caused by consummating the Acquisitions and integrating the Wholesale Entities' operations; and\n\u25cf\nmanaging the increased debt levels incurred in connection with the Acquisitions.\nAn inability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost synergies of the Acquisitions, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of the combined company, which may materially adversely affect the value of our Class B Common Stock.\nIn addition, the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefit of our plan for integration may not be realized. Actual synergies, if achieved at all, may be lower than what we expect and may take longer to achieve than anticipated. For example, the elimination of duplicative costs may not be possible or may take longer than anticipated, or the benefits from the Acquisitions may be offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating the companies. If we are not able to adequately address these challenges, we may be unable to successfully integrate the Wholesale Entities' operations into our own or, even if we are able to combine the business operations successfully, to realize the anticipated benefits of the integration of the companies.\nOur business relationships, those of the Wholesale Entities or the combined company may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the Acquisitions.\nParties with which we or the Wholesale Entities do business may experience uncertainty associated with the Acquisitions, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us, the Wholesale Entities or the combined company. Our and the Wholesale Entities' business relationships may be subject to disruption, as customers, distributors, suppliers, vendors, and others may seek to receive confirmation that their existing business relations with us or the Wholesale Entities, as the case may be, will not be adversely impacted as a result of the Acquisitions or attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us, the Wholesale Entities, or the combined company as a result of the Acquisitions. Any of these other disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our or the Wholesale Entities' businesses, financial condition, or results of operations or on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the combined company, and could also have an adverse effect on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisitions.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting for the combined companies, we may fail to prevent or detect material misstatements in our financial statements, in which case investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements.\nWe may encounter difficulties and unanticipated issues in combining our respective accounting systems due to the complexity of the financial reporting processes. We may also identify errors or misstatements that could require adjustments. If we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may fail to prevent or detect material misstatements in our financial statements, in which case investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our securities may decline.\nThe Wholesale Entities may have liabilities that are not known, probable or estimable at this time.\nAs a result of the Acquisitions, the Wholesale Entities are subsidiaries of the Company and remain subject to their past, current and future liabilities. There could be unasserted claims or assessments against or affecting the Wholesale Entities, including the failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, orders and consent decrees or infringement or misappropriation of third-party intellectual property or other proprietary rights that we failed or were unable to discover or identify in the course of performing our due diligence investigation of the Wholesale Entities. In addition, there are liabilities of the Wholesale Entities that are neither probable nor estimable at this time that may become probable or estimable in the future, including indemnification requests received from customers of the Wholesale Entities relating to claims of infringement or misappropriation of third party intellectual property or other proprietary rights, tax liabilities arising in connection with ongoing or future tax audits and liabilities in connection with other past, current and future legal claims and litigation. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. We may learn additional information about the Wholesale Entities that adversely affects us, such as unknown, unasserted, or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws or infringement or misappropriation of third-party intellectual property or other proprietary rights.\nAs a result of the Acquisitions, we and the Wholesale Entities may be unable to retain key employees.\nOur success after the Acquisitions depends in part upon our ability to retain key employees of ours and the Wholesale Entities. Key employees may depart because of a variety of reasons relating to the Acquisitions. If we and the Wholesale Entities are unable to retain key personnel who are critical to the successful integration and future operations of the combined company, we could face disruptions in our operations, loss of existing customers, loss of key information, expertise or know-how, and unanticipated additional recruitment and training costs. In addition, the loss of key personnel could diminish the anticipated benefits of the Acquisitions.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nThe trading price for our Class B Common Stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in per share price.\nOur Class B Common Stock is listed for trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the trading symbol \"RMBL,\" however historically there has been a limited public market for our Class B Common Stock. The liquidity of any market for the shares of our Class B Common Stock will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe number of stockholders;\n\u25cf\nour operating performance and financial condition;\n\u25cf\nthe market for similar securities;\n\u25cf\nthe extent of coverage of us by securities or industry analysts; and\n\u25cf\nthe interest of securities dealers in making a market in the shares of our common stock.\nThe market price for our Class B Common Stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the price of shares of our Class B Common Stock could decline significantly if our future operating results fail to meet or exceed the expectations of market analysts and investors and actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect our share price.\nOther factors may also contribute to volatility of the price of our Class B Common Stock and could subject our Class B Common Stock to wide fluctuations. These include:\n\u25cf\ndevelopments in the financial markets and worldwide or regional economies;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by the government relating to regulations that govern our industry;\n\u25cf\nsignificant sales of our Class B Common Stock or other securities in the open market;\n\u25cf\nvariations in interest rates;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the market valuations of other comparable companies; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in accounting principles.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and an even greater percentage of the Company's voting power and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nOur executive officers and directors as a group beneficially own shares of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock representing approximately 32.46% in aggregate of our voting power, including approximately 26.37% in aggregate voting power held by Messrs. Chesrown and Berrard as the only holders of our 50,000 outstanding shares of our Class A Common Stock, which has 10 votes for each one share outstanding. As a result, these stockholders have the ability to exert significant control over matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders are able to exert significant control over elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents' approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may believe are in your best interest as a stockholder or to take other action that you may believe are not in your best interest as a stockholder. This may also adversely affect the market price of our Class B Common Stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class B Common Stock may be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, our intellectual property or our stock performance, or if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nBecause our Class B Common Stock may be deemed a low-priced \"penny\" stock, an investment in our Class B Common Stock should be considered high risk and subject to marketability restrictions.\nWhen the trading price of our Class B Common Stock is $5.00 per share or lower, it is deemed a penny stock, as defined in Rule 3a51-1 under the Exchange Act, and subject to the penny stock rules of the Exchange Act specified in rules 15g-1 through 15g-10. Those rules require broker-dealers, before effecting transactions in any penny stock, to:\n\u25cf\ndeliver to the customer, and obtain a written receipt for, a disclosure document;\n\u25cf\ndisclose certain price information about the stock;\n\u25cf\ndisclose the amount of compensation received by the broker-dealer or any associated person of the broker-dealer;\n\u25cf\nsend monthly statements to customers with market and price information about the penny stock; and\n\u25cf\nin some circumstances, approve the purchaser's account under certain standards and deliver written statements to the customer with information specified in the rules.\nConsequently, if our Class B Common Stock is $5.00 per share price or lower, the penny stock rules may restrict the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to sell the Class B Common Stock and may affect the ability of holders to sell their Class B Common Stock in the secondary market and the price at which such holders can sell any such securities. These additional procedures could also limit our ability to raise additional capital in the future.\nWe do not currently or for the foreseeable future intend to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future on the shares of common stock. We intend to reinvest any earning in the development and expansion of our business. As a result, any return on your investment in our common stock will be limited to the appreciation in the price of our common stock, if any.\nWe are subject to reduced reporting requirements so long as we are considered a \"smaller reporting company\" and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are subject to reduced reporting requirements so long as we are considered a \"smaller reporting company.\" We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or any subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions may limit the ability of another party to acquire us, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nNevada law and our charter, bylaws, and other governing documents contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders, which could cause our stock price to decline. In addition, these provisions could limit the price investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nRisks Related to the Company's 6.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the \"Notes\")\nAlthough the Notes are referred to as convertible senior Notes, the Notes are effectively subordinated to any of our future secured debt and structurally subordinated to any liabilities of our subsidiaries.\nThe Notes rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, equal in right of payment with all of our liabilities that is not so subordinated, effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our current or future subsidiaries. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization, or other winding up, our assets that secure debt ranking senior or equal in right of payment to the Notes will be available to pay obligations on the Notes only after the secured debt has been repaid in full from these assets, and the assets of our subsidiaries will be available to pay obligations on the Notes only after all claims senior to the Notes have been repaid in full. There may not be sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts due on any or all of the Notes then outstanding. The indenture governing the Notes (the \"Indenture\") does not prohibit us from incurring additional senior debt or any future secured debt, nor does it prohibit any of our current or future subsidiaries from incurring additional liabilities.\nAs of December 31, 2019, excluding operating lease liabilities and the derivative liability, our total consolidated net indebtedness was approximately $82,585,522, of which an aggregate of $60,494,304 was secured indebtedness, and approximately $59,160,970 of such secured indebtedness is directly attributable to the Company's vehicles in inventory or held for sale, and the security of those lenders includes all of the vehicles financed by such lenders as well as all of the assets of our subsidiaries Wholesale Inc. and AutoSport USA, Inc. As of December 31, 2019, approximately $80,092,280 of our total consolidated indebtedness was senior indebtedness.\nThe Notes are our obligations only and a substantial portion of our operations are conducted through, and a substantial portion of our consolidated assets are held by, our subsidiaries.\nThe Notes are our obligations exclusively. A substantial portion of our operations is conducted through, and a substantial portion of our consolidated assets is held by, our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our ability to service our debt, including the Notes, depends, in part, on the results of operations of our subsidiaries and on the ability of such subsidiaries to provide us with cash, whether in the form of dividends, loans, or otherwise, to pay amounts due on our obligations, including the Notes. However, our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities, are not guaranteeing the Notes, and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to make payments on the Notes or to make any funds available for that purpose. In addition, dividends, loans, or other distributions to us from such subsidiaries may be subject to contractual and other restrictions and are subject to other business considerations. Our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries on such subsidiary's bankruptcy, liquidation, or reorganization, and, therefore, the right of the holders of Notes to participate in those assets, will be subject to prior claims of creditors of the subsidiary, including trade creditors, and such subsidiary may not have sufficient assets remaining to make any payments to us as a shareholder or otherwise. We advise holders of Notes that there may not be sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts due on any or all the Notes then outstanding.\nOperating our business requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay the Notes and any other debt.\nOur ability to make payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance the Notes or other indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt, obtaining additional debt financing, or issuing additional equity securities, any of which may be on terms that are not favorable to us or, in the case of equity securities, highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance the Notes or our other indebtedness will depend on the capital markets, our business, and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. In addition, our future debt agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with any such covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our debt.\nRecent and future regulatory actions and other events may adversely affect the trading price and liquidity of the Notes.\nWe expect that many investors in, and potential purchasers of, the Notes will employ, or seek to employ, a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to the Notes. Investors would typically implement such a strategy by selling short the Class B Common Stock underlying the Notes and dynamically adjusting their short position while continuing to hold the Notes. Investors may also implement this type of strategy by entering into swaps on our Class B Common Stock in lieu of or in addition to short selling the Class B Common Stock.\nThe SEC and other regulatory and self-regulatory authorities have implemented various rules and taken certain actions, and may in the future adopt additional rules and take other actions, that may impact those engaging in short selling activity involving equity securities (including our Class B Common Stock) and securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities. Such rules and actions include Rule 201 of SEC Regulation SHO, the adoption by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. and the national securities exchanges of a \"Limit Up-Limit Down\" program, the imposition of market-wide circuit breakers that halt trading of securities for certain periods following specific market declines, and the implementation of certain regulatory reforms required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Any government or regulatory action that restricts the ability of investors in or potential purchasers of the Notes to effect short sales of our Class B Common Stock, borrow our Class B Common Stock, or enter into swaps on our Class B Common Stock could adversely affect the trading price and the liquidity of the Notes.\nThe trading price for our Class B Common Stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in per share price which could adversely impact the trading price of the Notes.\nOur Class B Common Stock is listed for trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the trading symbol \"RMBL,\" however historically there has been a limited public market for our Class B Common Stock. The liquidity of any market for the shares of our Class B Common Stock will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe number of stockholders;\n\u25cf\nour operating performance and financial condition;\n\u25cf\nthe market for similar securities;\n\u25cf\nthe extent of coverage of us by securities or industry analysts; and\n\u25cf\nthe interest of securities dealers in making a market in the shares of our common stock.\nThe market price for our Class B Common Stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the price of shares of our Class B Common Stock could decline significantly if our future operating results fail to meet or exceed the expectations of market analysts and investors and actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect our share price.\nOther factors may also contribute to volatility of the price of our Class B Common Stock and could subject our Class B Common Stock to wide fluctuations. These include:\n\u25cf\ndevelopments in the financial markets and worldwide or regional economies;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by the government relating to regulations that govern our industry;\n\u25cf\nsignificant sales of our Class B Common Stock or other securities in the open market;\n\u25cf\nvariations in interest rates;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the market valuations of other comparable companies; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in accounting principles.\nA decrease in the market price of our Class B Common Stock would likely adversely impact the trading price of the Notes. The market price of our Class B Common Stock could also be affected by possible sales of our Class B Common Stock by investors who view the Notes as a more attractive means of investing in us and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our Class B Common Stock. This trading activity could adversely affect the trading price of the Notes.\nWe may incur substantially more debt in the future or take other actions which would intensify the risks discussed in these risk factors.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future (including secured debt), subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments. We are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the Notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, refinancing our debt, repurchasing our stock, pledging our assets, making investments, paying dividends, guaranteeing debt, or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture governing the Notes, any of which could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the Notes when due.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle the Notes in cash on a conversion, to repurchase the Notes on a fundamental change, or to repay the Notes at maturity. In addition, the terms of our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash on conversion or repurchase of the Notes.\nHolders of the Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes on the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding the fundamental change repurchase date, as described in the Indenture. In addition, on conversion of the Notes, unless we elect to deliver only shares of our Class B Common Stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted. Moreover, we are required to repay the Notes in cash at their maturity unless earlier converted or repurchased. Our ability to meet our obligations to holders of the Notes depends on our operating results and cash flow. However, we may not have enough available funds on hand or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make payments with respect to Notes at maturity, on surrender for repurchase, or on conversion.\nIn addition, our ability to repurchase the Notes or to pay cash on conversions of the Notes may be limited by law, regulations, or agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture governing the Notes or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Notes or at maturity as required by such indenture would constitute a default under such indenture. A default under such indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or make cash payments on conversions of the Notes, if settled in cash.\nRedemption may adversely affect the return on the Notes.\nWe may not redeem the Notes prior to January 14, 2023. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at our option, on or after January 14, 2023 if the last reported sale price of our Class B Common Stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price of the Notes then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption, during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. We may choose to redeem some or all of the Notes, including at times when prevailing interest rates are relatively low. Holders of the Notes may not be able to reinvest the proceeds from the redemption of the Notes in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on the Notes being redeemed.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of such Notes will be entitled to convert their Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If any holder elects to convert its Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering only shares of our Class B Common Stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation in cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current liability rather than a long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital and may harm our business.\nConversion of the Notes may dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders or may otherwise depress the market price of our Class B Common Stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the Notes may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. On conversion of the Notes, we have the option to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our Class B Common Stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our Class B Common Stock. In addition, in certain circumstances, we will make an interest make-whole payment to a converting holder which may be paid in cash or shares of our common stock. If we elect to settle our conversion obligation (or the interest make-whole payment) in shares of our Class B Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of our Class B Common Stock, any sales in the public market of our Class B Common Stock issuable on such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Class B Common Stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Notes into shares of our Class B Common Stock could depress the market price of our Class B Common Stock.\nFuture sales of our Class B Common Stock or equity-linked securities in the public market could lower the market price for our Class B Common Stock and adversely impact the trading price of the Notes.\nIn the future, we may raise funds by selling additional equity, equity-linked securities, or debt securities. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our Class B Common Stock is reserved for issuance on the exercise of stock options, settlement of restricted stock units, and conversion of the Notes. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our Class B Common Stock. The issuance and sale of substantial amounts of our Class B Common Stock or equity-linked securities, or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of the Notes and the market price of our Class B Common Stock, and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities.\nHolders of Notes are not entitled to any rights with respect to our Class B Common Stock, but they will be subject to all changes made with respect to them to the extent our conversion obligation includes shares of our Class B Common Stock.\nHolders of Notes are not entitled to any rights with respect to our Class B Common Stock (including, without limitation, rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on our Class B Common Stock) prior to the conversion date relating to such Notes (if we have elected to settle the conversion by delivering only shares of our Class B Common Stock, other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share) or the last trading day of the observation period (if we elect to pay and deliver, as the case may be, a combination of cash and shares of our Class B Common Stock in respect of the conversion). But, holders of Notes will be subject to all changes affecting our Class B Common Stock. For example, if an amendment is proposed to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws requiring stockholder approval and the record date for determining the stockholders of record entitled to vote on the amendment occurs prior to the conversion date with respect to any Notes surrendered for conversion, then the holder surrendering such Notes will not be entitled to vote on the amendment, although such holder will nevertheless be subject to any changes affecting our Class B Common Stock.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes could result in holders receiving less than the value of our Class B Common Stock into which the Notes would otherwise be convertible.\nPrior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding July 1, 2024, holders may convert their Notes only if specified conditions are met. If the specific conditions for conversion are not met, holders will not be able to convert their Notes during that period, and they may not be able to receive the shares of Class B Common Stock (or the value of such shares in cash or a combination of cash and shares of Class B Common Stock) into which the Notes would otherwise be convertible.\nOn conversion of the Notes, holders may receive less valuable consideration than expected because the value of our Class B Common Stock may decline after holders exercise their conversion rights but before we settle our conversion obligation.\nUnder the Notes, a converting holder will be exposed to fluctuations in the value of our Class B Common Stock during the period from the date such holder surrenders Notes for conversion until the date we settle our conversion obligation.\nOn conversion of the Notes, we have the option to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our Class B Common Stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our Class B Common Stock (including, if applicable, any interest make-whole payment we elect, or are deemed to have elected to satisfy by delivering shares of our Class B Common Stock). If we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation in cash or a combination of cash and shares of our Class B Common Stock, the amount of consideration that holders will receive on conversion of their Notes will be determined by reference to the volume-weighted average price of our Class B Common Stock for each trading day in a 40-trading day observation period and an interest make-whole payment, if applicable.\nAccordingly, if the price of our Class B Common Stock decreases during the applicable period, the amount and value of consideration holders receive will be adversely affected. In addition, if the market price of our Class B Common Stock at the end of such period is below the volume-weighted average price of our Class B Common Stock during such period, the value of any shares of our Class B Common Stock that holders will receive in satisfaction of our conversion obligation will be less than the value used to determine the number of shares that holders will receive.\nIf we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation only in shares of our Class B Common Stock on conversion of the Notes, we will, subject to the blocker provisions to the extent applicable, be required to deliver the shares of our Class B Common Stock, together with cash for any fractional share, on the second business day following the conversion date (provided that, with respect to any conversion date following the regular record date immediately preceding the maturity date where physical settlement applies to the related conversion, we will settle any such conversion on the maturity date). Accordingly, if the price of our Class B Common Stock decreases during this period, the value of the shares that holders receive will be adversely affected and would be less than the conversion value of the Notes on the conversion date.\nThe increase in the conversion rate for Notes converted in connection with a make-whole fundamental change or a notice of redemption may not adequately compensate holders for any lost value of their Notes as a result of such transaction or redemption.\nIf a make-whole fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date for the Notes or if we deliver a notice of redemption with respect to the Notes, we will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for the Notes by a number of additional shares of our Class B Common Stock for Notes converted in connection with such make-whole fundamental change or notice of redemption. The increase in the conversion rate will be determined based on the date on which the make-whole fundamental change occurs or becomes effective, or the date we deliver the notice of redemption, as the case may be, and the price paid (or deemed to be paid) per share of our Class B Common Stock in the make-whole fundamental change or determined with respect to the notice of redemption, as the case may be. The increase in the conversion rate for Notes converted in connection with a make-whole fundamental change or a notice of redemption may not adequately compensate you for any lost value of your Notes as a result of such transaction or redemption. In addition, if the \"stock price\" (as defined in the Indenture) is greater than $1.00 per share or less than the Make-Whole Adjustment Reference Price (as defined in the Indenture\u201d), no additional shares of Class B Common Stock will be added to the conversion rate. Moreover, in no event will the conversion rate per $1,000 principal amount of Notes as a result of this adjustment exceed 61.6523 shares of Class B Common Stock, subject to adjustment in the same manner as the conversion rate for the Notes.\nOur obligation to increase the conversion rate for Notes converted in connection with a make-whole fundamental change or a notice of redemption could be considered a penalty, in which case the enforceability would be subject to general principles of reasonableness and equitable remedies.\nThe conversion rate of the Notes may not be adjusted for dilutive events.\nThe conversion rate of the Notes is subject to adjustment for certain events, including, but not limited to, the issuance of certain stock dividends on our Class B Common Stock, the issuance of certain rights or warrants, subdivisions or combinations of our Class B Common Stock, distributions of capital stock, indebtedness, or assets, cash dividends, and certain issuer tender or exchange offers as described under the Indenture. However, the conversion rate will not be adjusted for other events, such as a third-party tender or exchange offer or an issuance of Class B Common Stock for cash, that may adversely affect the trading price of the Notes or our Class B Common Stock. An event that adversely affects the value of the Notes may occur, and that event may not result in an adjustment to the conversion rate. We have no obligation to consider the specific interests of the holders of the Notes in engaging in any such offering or transaction.\nSome significant restructuring transactions may not constitute a fundamental change, in which case we would not be obligated to offer to repurchase the Notes.\nOn the occurrence of a fundamental change, you have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of your Notes. However, the fundamental change provisions do not afford protection to holders of Notes in the event of other transactions that could adversely affect the Notes. For example, transactions such as leveraged recapitalizations, refinancings, restructurings, or acquisitions initiated by us may not constitute a fundamental change requiring us to repurchase the Notes. In the event of any such transaction, the holders would not have the right to require us to repurchase the Notes, even though each of these transactions could increase the amount of our indebtedness or otherwise adversely affect our capital structure or any credit ratings, thereby adversely affecting the holders of Notes.\nCertain provisions in the indenture governing the Notes may delay or make it more expensive for a third party to acquire us.\nCertain provisions in the indenture governing the Notes may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, the indenture governing the Notes requires us, at the noteholders' election, to repurchase the Notes for cash on the occurrence of a fundamental change and, in certain circumstances, to increase the conversion rate for a holder that converts its Notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change. A takeover of us may trigger the requirement that we repurchase the Notes or increase the conversion rate, which could make it more costly for a third party to acquire us. Furthermore, the indenture for the Notes prohibits us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the Notes. These and other provisions in the indenture could deter or prevent a third party from making bids to acquire us even when the acquisition may be favorable to you.\nHolders of Notes are not entitled to receive any shares of our Class B Common Stock otherwise deliverable upon conversion of the Notes to the extent that such receipt would cause such holders to become, directly or indirectly, a beneficial owner of shares of our Class B Common Stock in excess of 4.99% of the total number of the shares of our Class B Common Stock then issued and outstanding.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, holders of Notes are not entitled to receive any shares of our Class B Common Stock otherwise deliverable upon conversion of the Notes to the extent, but only to the extent, that such receipt would cause such holders to become, directly or indirectly, the \"beneficial owner\" (within the meaning of Section 13(d) under the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder) of our Class B Common Stock in excess 4.99% of the total number of the shares of our Class B Common Stock then issued and outstanding. Any purported delivery of shares of our Class B Common Stock upon conversion of the Notes shall be void and have no effect to the extent, but only to the extent, that such delivery would result in any person becoming the beneficial owner of shares of our Class B Common Stock outstanding at such time in excess of the beneficial ownership limits then applicable to such person.\nAs a result of the beneficial ownership limits, shares of Class B Common Stock otherwise deliverable upon conversion of Notes may be delayed, or never delivered at all. These limitations on beneficial ownership may force you to sell shares of our Class B Common Stock or other securities you own in order to receive shares you would otherwise be entitled to receive upon conversion. If holders convert their Notes and do not receive any shares otherwise deliverable upon conversion, we are not be responsible for any lost value due to a delayed delivery, or if they are never delivered as a result of the conversion restrictions described above.\nWe cannot assure you that an active trading market will develop for the Notes.\nPrior to the 2020 Note Offering (as defined below), there has been no trading market for the Notes, and we do not intend to apply to list the Notes on any securities exchange or to arrange for quotation on any automated dealer quotation system. We have been informed by the initial purchaser that it intended to make a market in the Notes after the 2020 Note Offering. However, the initial purchaser may cease its market-making at any time without notice. The liquidity of the trading market in the Notes, and the market price quoted for the Notes, may be adversely affected by changes in the overall market for this type of security and by changes in our financial performance or prospects or in the prospects for companies in our industry generally. We cannot assure you that an active trading market will develop for the Notes. If an active trading market does not develop or is not maintained, the market price and liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected. In that case you may not be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or you may not be able to sell your Notes at a favorable price.\nAny adverse rating of the Notes may cause their trading price to fall.\nWe do not intend to seek a rating on the Notes. However, if a rating service were to rate the Notes and if such rating service were to lower its rating on the Notes below the rating initially assigned to such Notes or otherwise announce its intention to put such Notes on credit watch, the trading price of the Notes could decline.", "PERMNO": 16999, "SIC": 5961, "TIC": "RMBL"}
