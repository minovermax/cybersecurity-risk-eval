Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations, and you should carefully consider them. Accordingly, in evaluating our business, we encourage you to consider the following discussion of risk factors, in its entirety, in addition to other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other public filings with the SEC. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nRisks Related to Our Efforts to Develop Lenzilumab for COVID-19\nFDA declined our initial request for emergency use authorization for lenzilumab as a therapy for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The MHRA also has not approved our application for marketing authorization of lenzilumab in this indication. We are continuing to pursue an authorization or approval for lenzilumab\u2019s use in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the U.S., UK and EU, but may not obtain one.\nOn September 8, 2021, FDA informed us that it had declined to issue an EUA for lenzilumab for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. FDA has advised us that we will need to submit further safety and efficacy data in an amended application for EUA. Likewise, MHRA raised a number of questions in its review of our application for marketing authorization, including around efficacy, to which we need to respond. It is possible, but not assured, that the results from the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines-5 (\u201cACTIV-5\u201d) and Big Effect Trial, in the \u201cB\u201d arm of the trial (\u201cBET-B\u201d), referred to as the ACTIV-5/BET-B trial, being conducted by NIH, if confirmatory of the findings of the CRP subgroup from the LIVE-AIR study, may support our efficacy claim in such a way as to support an amendment to the EUA application and our response to MHRA. In addition, if the results from ACTIV-5/BET-B are not confirmatory of the results of the findings of the CRP subgroup from the LIVE-AIR study, we would either conduct a new clinical trial of our own or abandon this development program altogether. Unfavorable results likely would have a material and adverse impact on our stock price and ability to obtain future financing needed to continue as a going concern, as well.\nIf ACTIV-5/BET-B results confirm our findings from the CRP subgroup from the LIVE-AIR study, we may be required to obtain and submit additional information related to the Chemistry Manufacturing and Control (\u201cCMC\u201d) aspects of lenzilumab production before we attain EUA or any other authorization or approval. We are in the process of obtaining additional CMC information but there is no assurance as to exactly when or if we will generate sufficient information to satisfy regulatory requirements.\nMore broadly, in the context of EUA or any other request for a conditional marketing authorization or approval, there is no requirement that FDA or any regulatory body reach a favorable conclusion about our submissions. A myriad of factors, including the regulator\u2019s assessment of the urgency of the need for a therapeutic such as lenzilumab; the efficacy of lenzilumab in new or different variants that have emerged or may evolve; and other factors such as the development of more efficacious vaccines or therapies, may influence a regulator\u2019s decision on any submissions we may make.\nFurthermore, if an EUA is granted to permit lenzilumab to be commercialized for use in the treatment of COVID-19, the authorization would only remain in effect while a \u201cPublic Health Emergency\u201d is underway and might be expressly conditioned or limited by FDA. An EUA, if granted, could also be terminated if, in the future, there are changes in available data that bear on the risk-benefit analysis, or if alternative approved products become available.\nAccordingly, it is possible that FDA and other regulatory authorities may not authorize or approve lenzilumab for the treatment of COVID-19, or that any such authorization or approval, if granted, may have significant limitations on its use or subsequently be rescinded or terminated. We may never successfully commercialize lenzilumab for use in COVID-19 patients or realize a return on our significant investment in the development, supply, and commercialization of lenzilumab for this purpose.\nWe need to obtain additional financing to fund our operations and, if we are unable to obtain such financing, we may be unable to continue to operate as a going concern.\nDuring 2021, we incurred significant costs associated with our development program for lenzilumab in COVID-19 without attaining a regulatory authorization or approval to commercialize it. Our liquidity position is highly constrained as a result. We need to obtain additional financing to pursue the development of lenzilumab and our other product candidates pending our ability to commence commercialization and begin generating revenues from product sales if lenzilumab were to be authorized or approved by a regulatory agency.\nUntil we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue, we intend to attempt to finance future cash needs through our at-the-market offering program or other public or private equity offerings, license agreements, grant financing and support from governmental agencies, convertible debt, other debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, extending and managing amounts owed to vendors and marketing, supply, distribution or licensing arrangements. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We expect that the results of the ACTIV-5/BET-B trial will be important to potential investors in evaluating an investment in our company. Accordingly, our ability to raise capital on favorable terms in the future is linked closely to the success of that trial, which we cannot assure. Unfavorable results likely would have a material and adverse impact on our stock price and ability to obtain future financing.\nIf we are unsuccessful in efforts to raise additional capital, based on our current levels of operating expenses, our current capital is not expected to be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 were prepared on the basis of a going concern, which contemplates that we will be able to realize our assets and discharge liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.\nIn addition, the presence of the explanatory paragraph about our ability to continue as a going concern in our financial statements, could also make it more difficult to raise the capital necessary to address our current needs.\nOur commercial opportunity in COVID-19 may be reduced or eliminated if competing products for the same segment of patients that lenzilumab targets are authorized or approved.\nWe may not be successful in attaining any authorization or approval for lenzilumab in hospitalized COVID-19 patients before competitors receive authorization or approval of competitive therapeutics. In addition, vaccines, neutralizing antibodies, and oral antivirals which have been granted EUA and/or FDA approval to prevent COVID-19 may indirectly compete for the same patients by preventing hospitalization. As discussed in greater detail under \u201cItem 1. Business--Lenzilumab and COVID-19 Competition,\u201d several neutralizing antibodies have been approved to prevent progression in the early stages of infection, multiple vaccines and boosters have been authorized by FDA and other regulatory agencies, and there are numerous other companies working on therapies and/or vaccines to treat COVID-19. If additional competing therapies and/or vaccines are approved, such approval could have a material adverse impact on our ability to attain regulatory approvals needed to commercialize lenzilumab as a therapy for COVID-19.\nManufacturing efforts relating to our lenzilumab program in COVID-19 have been extremely costly and inefficient in producing treatments for use in our clinical development program or potential sale.\nOur complete reliance on third-party manufacturers to produce lenzilumab subjects us to a number of risks, as described in more detail under \u201c-Other Risks Related to Our Business and Industry\u201d below. We believe that our ability to obtain the requisite regulatory authorizations or approvals to permit lenzilumab to be used commercially for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 depends at least in part on our ability to demonstrate that we will be able to scale the manufacturing to produce a sufficient quantity of treatments, satisfying all applicable process performance qualification (\u201cPPQ\u201d) requirements, to address the potential demand for the product. Our efforts to develop that manufacturing scale have been impaired by the following:\n\u00b7 We have experienced and expect to continue to experience shortages of raw materials and critical components necessary for our manufacturing processes.\n\u00b7 We struggled to reserve manufacturing slots at our CMOs. During the latter half of 2020, and continuing into 2021, it was and continues to be more challenging and expensive to obtain these slots due to increased demand for production at our CMOs, many of which also manufacture vaccines and other therapeutics.\n\u00b7 Even after being reserved and paid for, the manufacturing slots for which we contracted were in some cases displaced as mandated from Rated Orders issued under the U.S Defense Production Act (\u201cDPA\u201d). This displacement risk has caused us to expend significant efforts to manage our supply chain and add additional CMOs.\n\u00b7 Some of our CMOs struggled or outright failed to produce lenzilumab meeting our specifications. The process of manufacturing biologics is extremely susceptible to product loss due to contamination, equipment failure or improper installation or operation of equipment, or vendor or operator error. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects and other supply disruptions. If microbial, viral, foreign substances or other contaminations are discovered in our products or in the manufacturing facilities in which our products are made, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination. We lost batches of lenzilumab BDS to several of these disruptive errors, which has limited the number of potential treatments on hand. In addition, two of our CMOs have denied responsibility for the challenges they experienced and are demanding payment despite not delivering usable BDS; these payment demands, if resolved adversely to us, would further impair our liquidity.\n\u00b7 Subsequent to FDA\u2019s declination to grant EUA following our initial request, we took action to cancel future manufacturing slots. While some in-process work is continuing, we do not yet have any capacity reserved for lenzilumab production beyond 2022, nor do we have agreements in place for the commercial production of lenzilumab. Accordingly, our ability to scale our manufacturing could be delayed if we were to attain a regulatory authorization or approval to commercialize lenzilumab in hospitalized COVID-19 patients later in 2022.\nInterim, top-line, ad-hoc, retrospective, exploratory or preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time-to-time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time-to-time, we may publicly disclose preliminary, \u201ctop-line\u201d or other data from clinical trials, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a full analysis of all data related to the particular trial. We may also seek to publish additional ad-hoc, retrospective or exploratory data, including results from patients with baseline CRP levels <150 mg/L. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, such results that we report may differ from future results of the same trials, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Such data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, interim, top-line, or preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. Such data from clinical trials are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Adverse differences between such data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects. Further, disclosure of interim, top-line or preliminary data by us or by our competitors could result in volatility in the price of shares of our common stock and dramatic spikes in trading volume, as we experienced following our announcement of top-line data from the LIVE-AIR study in March 2021.\nIn addition, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular product candidate or product, and our business in general. FDA\u2019s action to decline our initial request for EUA represents a dramatic manifestation of this risk. In addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose or to publish via a preprint publication regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information, and you or others may not agree with what we determine is the material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure, and any information we determine not to disclose may ultimately be deemed significant with respect to future decisions, conclusions, views, activities or otherwise regarding a particular drug, product candidate, or our business. If the top-line data that we report differ from actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for and commercialize our current or any our future product candidate, our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition may be harmed.\nTarget enrollment in the ACTIV-5/BET-B study has been reached in the primary analysis group (CRP<150 mg/L < 85 years old). Analysis of data can begin once the database lock has occurred. The NIH controls the data analysis and we may be unable to influence the timeline for completion. The primary endpoint is based on an assessment 29 days after treatment, and accordingly we believe top-line data from this study could be available in late first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2022, but the NIH may choose to wait until day 60 to complete their analysis. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic, and in particular the widespread transmission of the omicron variant even among vaccinated people, has had a significant negative impact on worker productivity. It is possible that, due to COVID-19 or other reasons, the timeline to collect and analyze the data from ACTIV-5/BET-B may be delayed, causing the anticipated timeline to slip. There can be no assurance that we will be able to report top-line results within the timeline established by our guidance or that the top-line results will be consistent with the final results as reported after Day 60.\nWe cannot predict public reaction or the impact on the market price of our common stock once further announcements regarding lenzilumab or developments from ACTIV-5/BET-B are announced. Given the attention being paid to the COVID-19 pandemic and the public scrutiny of COVID-19 development announcements and data releases to date, any public announcements we make in the coming months regarding the ongoing development and regulatory process for lenzilumab may attract significant attention and scrutiny and as a result, the price of our common stock may be volatile during this time.\nIf an authorization or approval were granted for lenzilumab, we may be unable to accurately predict demand for lenzilumab or to produce sufficient quantities on a timely basis to meet demand.\nIf lenzilumab were authorized or approved for commercial use, we may be unsuccessful in estimating user demand and may not be effective in matching inventory levels and locations to actual end user demand, in particular if the COVID-19 pandemic, including emerging variants, is effectively contained or the risk of patients being hospitalized as a result of coronavirus infection is significantly diminished. In addition, adverse changes in economic conditions, increased competition, including through approved/authorized vaccines or other therapeutics (including neutralizing antibodies and oral antivirals), or other factors may cause hospitals or other users or distributors of lenzilumab to reduce inventories of our products, which would reduce their orders for lenzilumab, even if end user demand has not changed. As a result, our revenues could be difficult to predict and vulnerable to extreme fluctuations.\nThere can be no assurance that lenzilumab, even if approved, would ever become profitable, due to government or healthcare provider or payer interest and public perception regarding vaccines and treatments for COVID-19 related complications.\nAs a result of the emergency situations in many countries, there is a heightened risk that a COVID-19 therapy or other treatments for COVID-19 symptoms may be subject to adverse governmental actions in certain countries, including intellectual property expropriation, compulsory licenses, strict price controls or other actions. Additionally, we may need, or we may be required by governmental or non-governmental authorities, to set aside specific quantities of doses of lenzilumab for designated purposes or geographic areas. We may face challenges related to the allocation of supply of lenzilumab, particularly with respect to geographic distribution. Thus, even if lenzilumab is approved, such governmental actions may limit our ability to recoup our current and future expenses incurred to develop and commercialize lenzilumab.\nFurthermore, public sentiment regarding commercialization of a COVID-19 therapy or other treatment may limit or negate our ability to generate revenues from sales of lenzilumab. If authorized or approved, we may face significant public attention and scrutiny over any future business models and pricing decisions with respect to lenzilumab. If we are unable to successfully manage these risks, we could face significant reputational harm, which could negatively affect the price of our common stock.\nWe currently have no internal sales and marketing capabilities and will rely on third parties to market and sell lenzilumab if we attain an EUA or other regulatory approval for its commercialization, and any product candidates we may successfully develop. We or they may not be able to effectively market and sell any such product candidates.\nWe currently do not have internal sales and marketing infrastructure in place that would be necessary to sell and market products and we may choose to not build this capability in-house. As is the case with many, if not most, small companies seeking to commercialize their products and who have not yet partnered with a larger biotech or pharmaceutical company, we have entered into an arrangement to outsource logistics and distribution services as described under \u201cItem 1. Business-Sales and Marketing.\u201d There can be no assurance that our partner will be effective in distributing lenzilumab.\nIf we or any of our potential partners fail to hire, train, retain and manage qualified sales personnel, market our product successfully or on a cost-effective basis, our ability to generate revenue will be limited and we will need to identify and retain an alternative third-party, or develop our own sales and marketing capability. The establishment of an in-house sales and marketing operation can be expensive and time consuming and could delay any product candidate launch.\nOther Risks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have a history of operating losses, we expect to continue to incur losses, and we may never become profitable.\nWe have incurred net losses in nearly every year since our inception. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred a net loss of $236.6 million, and we have an accumulated deficit of $611.1 million as of December 31, 2021. Since inception, we have recognized a nominal amount of revenue from payments for license or collaboration fees, $3.6 million of which was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2021. We expect to make substantial expenditures and incur additional operating losses in the future to further develop and commercialize our product candidates. Our accumulated deficit is expected to increase significantly as we continue our development and clinical trial efforts. Our ability to achieve and sustain profitability depends on obtaining regulatory approvals for and successfully commercializing our product candidates, either alone or with third parties. We do not currently have the required approvals to market any of our product candidates and we may never receive them. We may not be profitable even if we or any future development partners succeed in commercializing any of our product candidates. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing and commercializing our product candidates, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable, if at all.\nOur business depends on the success of our current product candidates. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, any of our product candidates.\nWe have a limited pipeline of product candidates and we do not plan to conduct active research at this time for discovery of new molecules or antibodies. We depend on the successful development and attainment of regulatory authorization or approval of our current product candidates for our future business success. The future clinical, regulatory and commercial success of our product candidates is subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u00b7 we may not be able to enroll adequate numbers of eligible patients in the clinical trials we propose to conduct, whether alone or through collaborations;\n\u00b7 we may not have sufficient financial and other resources to fund our clinical trials or collaborations;\n\u00b7 we may not be able to provide acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy for our product candidates;\n\u00b7 the results of our clinical trials or collaborations may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance, or product safety, required to move to the next stage of development or, ultimately, obtain marketing approval from FDA;\n\u00b7 we may not be able to obtain, maintain and enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights; and\n\u00b7 we may not be able to obtain and maintain commercial manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers or establish commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities.\nIn addition, the fluid and unpredictable nature of the COVID-19 pandemic may affect our ability to conduct our ongoing clinical trials, delay the initiation of planned and future clinical trials, cause interruptions in the supply of raw materials or products, delay the collection of clinical trial data, and disrupt regulatory activities. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our product candidates will be successfully developed or commercialized. If we or any future development partners are unable to develop, or obtain regulatory approval for or, if approved, successfully commercialize one or more of our product candidates, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to continue our business.\nFurthermore, even if we do receive regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates, any such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market the product. If any of our product candidates are unsuccessful, that could have a substantial negative impact on our business.\nThe adoption of CAR-T therapies as the potential standard of care for treatment of certain cancers is uncertain, and dependent on the efforts of a limited number of market entrants, and if not adopted as anticipated, the market for lenzilumab or next-generation gene-edited CAR-T therapies may be limited or not develop.\nWe are seeking to advance the development of lenzilumab to address, among other things, the serious and potentially fatal side effects, specifically ICANS and CRS associated with CAR-T therapies and to improve the efficacy of these treatments. We, through our collaboration with Mayo Clinic, are also working to create next-generation gene-edited CAR-T therapies using GM-CSF gene knockout technologies. Although five CAR-T therapies have been approved by FDA to date, the use of engineered T cells as a potential cancer treatment is a recent development and may not be broadly accepted by physicians, patients, hospitals, cancer treatment centers, payers and others in the medical community.\nIf the medical and payer community is not sufficiently persuaded of the safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of CAR-T therapy and the potential advantages of using lenzilumab compared to existing and future therapeutics, and there is not significant market acceptance of CAR-T therapy as the standard of care for treatment of certain cancers, the market for lenzilumab or next-generation gene-edited CAR-T therapies may be limited or not develop, and our stock price could be adversely affected.\nCAR-T therapies currently in early development purport to incorporate technology that may minimize or eliminate the adverse side-effects, namely ICANS and CRS, and improve on efficacy, that we believe have impaired the uptake of the approved CAR-T therapies. If these developing therapies are proven safer and equally or more efficacious in their proposed indications and approved for use by FDA and other regulatory agencies, the market growth for the currently approved CAR-T therapies may be limited, impairing demand for lenzilumab.\nIn recent years, several biotechnology companies describing business plans focusing on development of CAR-T therapies have completed or announced they are pursuing initial public offerings (\u201cIPOs\u201d). Several of these companies have described their belief that their therapies will not result in the same level of ICANS or CRS as has been experienced in use of previously FDA-approved CAR-T therapies. While these products are in early-stage development, the data is limited and these products have not yet been approved for use by FDA, if new CAR-T therapies with lower occurrences of CRS and ICANS are approved, the market for lenzilumab in conjunction with CAR-T therapy may be diminished. Any such failure of a market for lenzilumab to develop could adversely affect our stock price. In addition, if new CAR-T therapies that offer improved efficacy, either with or without improved safety, are approved, the market for lenzilumab which is used in conjunction with CAR-T therapy may be diminished if such CAR-T therapy is used in preference to existing CAR-T therapy. For more information regarding FDA-approved CAR-T therapies, see \u201cItem 1. Business-Lenzilumab in CAR-T.\u201d\nOur business could target benefits from various regulatory incentives, such as orphan drug exclusivity, breakthrough therapy designation, fast track designation, and priority review, but we may not ultimately qualify for or benefit from these incentives.\nWe may seek various regulatory incentives, such as orphan drug exclusivity, breakthrough therapy designation, fast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review and Priority Review Vouchers (\u201cPRVs\u201d), where available, that provide for certain periods of exclusivity, expedited review and/or other benefits, and we may also seek similar designations elsewhere in the world. Often, regulatory agencies have broad discretion in determining whether or not products qualify for such regulatory incentives and benefits. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to receive orphan drug status from FDA or equivalent regulatory designations elsewhere. We also cannot guarantee that we will obtain breakthrough therapy or fast track designation, which may provide certain potential benefits such as more frequent meetings with FDA to discuss the development plan, intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, and potential eligibility for rolling review or priority review. Legislative developments in the U.S., including proposed legislation that would restrict eligibility for PRVs, may affect our ability to qualify for these programs in the future.\nEven if we are successful in obtaining beneficial regulatory designations by FDA or other regulatory agency for our product candidates, such designations may not lead to faster development or regulatory review or approval and does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval. We may not be able to obtain or maintain such designations for our product candidates, and our competitors may obtain these designations for their product candidates, which could impact our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates or compete with such competitors, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThere is a limited amount of information about us upon which investors can evaluate our product candidates and business prospects, including because we have a limited operating history developing product candidates, and we have not yet successfully commercialized any products, and have a relatively small management team.\nOur primary focus is developing our proprietary monoclonal antibody portfolio, primarily lenzilumab and iFab. Our limited operating history developing clinical-stage product candidates may make it more difficult for us to succeed or for investors to be able to evaluate our business and prospects. In addition, as an early-stage clinical development company, we have limited experience in development activities, including conducting clinical trials, or seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals, even though our executives have had relevant experience at other companies. We currently have ten full-time employees and therefore are heavily dependent on external consultants and expert vendors for clinical, scientific, contract manufacturing and regulatory expertise. To execute our business plan, we will need to successfully:\n\u00b7 execute our product candidate development activities, including successfully completing our clinical trial programs, including those conducted under our collaborations and partnerships;\n\u00b7 obtain required regulatory approvals or authorizations for the development and commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 manage our costs and expenses related to clinical trials, regulatory approvals, manufacturing and commercialization;\n\u00b7 secure substantial additional funding;\n\u00b7 develop and maintain successful strategic relationships;\n\u00b7 build and maintain a strong intellectual property portfolio;\n\u00b7 build and maintain appropriate clinical, sales, manufacturing, distribution, and marketing capabilities on our own or through third parties; and\n\u00b7 gain market acceptance and favorable reimbursement status for our product candidates.\nIf we are unsuccessful in accomplishing these objectives, we may not be able to develop product candidates, raise capital, expand our business, or continue our operations.\nIn addition to our collaborations with the NIH, Mayo Clinic, IMPACT Partnership, SAHMRI and the University of Adelaide, and the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Research Centre, we may, in the future, seek to enter into collaborations with other third parties for the discovery, development and commercialization of our product candidates. If our collaborators cease development efforts under our collaboration agreements, or if any of those agreements are terminated, these collaborations may fail to lead to commercial products, and we may never receive milestone payments or future royalties under these agreements.\nWe may in the future seek to enter into agreements with other third-party collaborators for research, development and commercialization of other therapeutic technologies or product candidates. Biopharmaceutical companies are our likely future collaborators for any marketing, distribution, development, licensing, or broader collaboration arrangements. If we fail to enter into future collaborations on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or such collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to execute our strategy to develop our product candidates or therapies that we believe could benefit from the resources of either larger biopharmaceutical companies or those specialized in a particular area of relevance.\nWith respect to our existing collaboration agreements, we have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Moreover, our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators\u2019 abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\nCollaborations involving our product candidates pose the following risks to us, among others:\n\u00b7 collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u00b7 collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on preclinical studies or clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators\u2019 strategic focus or available funding, or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u00b7 collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u00b7 collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u00b7 collaborators with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products;\n\u00b7 collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to litigation or potential liability;\n\u00b7 collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n\u00b7 disputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources; and\n\u00b7 collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates.\nAs a result of the foregoing, our current and any future collaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of our product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all. Any failure to successfully develop or commercialize our product candidates pursuant to our current or any future collaboration agreements could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nMoreover, to the extent that any of our existing or future collaborators were to terminate a collaboration agreement, we may be forced to independently develop these product candidates, including funding preclinical studies or clinical trials, assuming marketing and distribution costs and defending intellectual property rights, or, in certain instances, abandon product candidates altogether, any of which could result in a change to our business plan and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe have relied and may in the future rely on third parties to conduct Investigator Sponsored Trials (\u201cISTs\u201d) of our products, which is cost-effective for us but affords the investigators the ability to retain significant control over the design and conduct of the trials, as well as the use of the data generated from their efforts.\nWe have relied and may in the future rely on third parties to conduct and sponsor clinical trials relating to lenzilumab, our GM-CSF gene knockout platform and our other immunotherapy product candidates, iFab and HGEN005. Such ISTs may provide us with valuable clinical data that can inform our future development strategy in a cost-efficient manner, but we do not control the design or conduct of the ISTs, and it is possible that FDA or non-U.S. regulatory authorities will not view these ISTs as providing adequate support for future clinical trials, whether controlled by us or third parties, for any one or more reasons, including elements of the design or execution of the trials or safety concerns or other trial results.\nThese arrangements provide us limited information rights with respect to the ISTs, including access to and the ability to use and reference the data, including for our own regulatory filings, resulting from the ISTs. However, we would not have control over the timing and reporting of the data from ISTs, nor would we own the data from the ISTs. If we are unable to confirm or replicate the results from the ISTs or if negative results are obtained, we would likely be further delayed or prevented from advancing further clinical development. Further, if investigators or institutions breach their obligations with respect to the clinical development of our product candidates, or if the data proves to be inadequate compared to the first-hand knowledge, we might have gained had the ISTs been sponsored and conducted by us, then our ability to design and conduct any future clinical trials ourselves may be adversely affected.\nIf the third parties conducting our clinical trials do not conduct the trials in accordance with our agreements with them, our ability to pursue our clinical development programs could be delayed or unsuccessful and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates when expected or at all.\nWe do not have the ability to conduct all aspects of our preclinical testing or clinical trials ourselves. Therefore, the timing of the initiation and completion of these trials is uncertain and may occur on substantially different timing from our estimates. We also use CROs to conduct our clinical trials and rely on medical institutions, clinical investigators, CROs, and consultants to conduct our trials in accordance with our clinical protocols and regulatory requirements. Our CROs, investigators, and other third parties play a significant role in the conduct of these trials and subsequent collection and analysis of data.\nThere is no guarantee that NIH, any CROs, investigators, or other third parties on which we rely for administration and conduct of our clinical trials will devote adequate time and resources to such trials or perform as contractually required. If any of these third parties fails to meet expected deadlines, fails to adhere to our clinical protocols, or otherwise performs in a substandard manner, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed, or terminated. If any of our clinical trial sites terminates for any reason, we may experience the loss of follow-up information on subjects enrolled in our ongoing clinical trials unless we are able to transfer those subjects to another qualified clinical trial site. In addition, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time-to-time and may receive cash or equity compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be jeopardized.\nWe may experience delays in commencing or conducting our clinical trials, in receiving data from third parties or in the continuation or completion of clinical testing, which could result in increased costs to us, delay our ability to generate product candidate revenue or, ultimately, render us unable to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe have product candidates in clinical development and preclinical development. To obtain marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Before we can initiate clinical trials in the U.S. for any new product candidates, we are required to submit the results of preclinical testing to FDA as part of an IND application, along with other information including information about product candidate chemistry, manufacturing, and controls and our proposed clinical trial protocol.\nIn order to continue with our testing programs already underway, we are required to report or provide information to appropriate regulatory authorities, and any failure to timely submit such reports or information will delay our plans for our clinical trials. If third parties conducting our trials do not make the required data available to us, we will likely have to identify and contract with another third party or develop necessary preclinical and clinical data on our own, which will lead to significant delays. In addition, FDA may require us to conduct additional preclinical testing for any product candidate before it allows us to initiate clinical testing under any IND application, which may lead to additional delays. Moreover, despite the presence of an active IND application for a product candidate, clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in:\n\u00b7 identifying, recruiting, enrolling and retaining or replacing qualified subjects to participate in a clinical trial, which may be slower than anticipated due to the number of companies and institutions competing for subjects in clinical studies with similar patient populations;\n\u00b7 identifying, recruiting, and training suitable clinical investigators;\n\u00b7 reaching agreements on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation, may be subject to modification from time-to-time, and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u00b7 obtaining and maintaining sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials;\n\u00b7 obtaining and maintaining Institutional Review Board (\u201cIRB\u201d) or ethics committee approval to conduct a clinical trial at an existing or prospective site;\n\u00b7 developing any companion diagnostic necessary to ensure the study enrolls the target population;\n\u00b7 being required by FDA to add more patients or sites or to conduct additional trials; or\n\u00b7 FDA placing a clinical trial on hold.\nClinical trials may also be delayed as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results. Further, a clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, an IRB, an ethics committee, or a data safety monitoring committee overseeing the clinical trial, any of our clinical trial sites with respect to that site, or FDA or other regulatory authorities, due to several factors, including unforeseen safety issues, known safety issues that occur at a greater frequency or severity than we anticipate, any determination that the clinical trial presents unacceptable health risks, or lack of adequate funding.\t\nAny delays in our clinical trials may delay or preclude our ability to further develop or pursue regulatory approval for our product candidates. Changes in U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements and guidance also may occur, and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to IRBs for re-examination, which may affect the costs, timing, and likelihood of a successful completion of a clinical trial.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or do not meet the standard for acceptability by regulatory authorities or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u00b7 be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates;\n\u00b7 not obtain marketing approval or EUA at all;\n\u00b7 obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u00b7 obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings;\n\u00b7 be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or\n\u00b7 have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nOur product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or in obtaining marketing approvals. We do not know whether any of our preclinical studies or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. We may also determine to change the design or protocol of one or more of our clinical trials, including to add additional arms or patient populations, which could result in increased costs and expenses and/or delays. If we or any future development partners experience delays in the completion of, or if we or any future development partners must terminate, any clinical trial of any product candidate, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for that product candidate will be delayed and the commercial prospects, if any, for the product candidate may suffer as a result. Significant preclinical study or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.\nOur product candidates are subject to extensive regulation, compliance with which is costly and time consuming, may cause unanticipated delays, may prevent the receipt of the required approvals to commercialize our product candidates, or may result in substantial harm to our business if we fail to comply with these requirements.\nThe clinical development, approval, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing, and distribution of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by FDA in the U.S. and by comparable authorities in foreign markets. In the U.S., we are not permitted to market our product candidates until we receive regulatory approval or other authorization, such as EUA, from FDA. The process of obtaining regulatory approval is expensive, often takes many years, and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the products involved, as well as the target indications. Approval policies or regulations may change, and FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval process, including the ability to delay, limit, or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons. Despite the time and expense invested in clinical development of product candidates, regulatory approval is never guaranteed. FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities can delay, limit, or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7 such authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our or any future development partners\u2019 clinical trials;\n\u00b7 such authorities may not accept clinical data from trials that are conducted at clinical facilities or in countries where the standard of care is potentially different from the U.S.;\n\u00b7 the results of clinical trials may not demonstrate the safety or efficacy required by such authorities for approval;\n\u00b7 we or any future development partners may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u00b7 such authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u00b7 such authorities may find deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we or any future development partners contract for clinical and commercial supplies; or\n\u00b7 the approval policies or regulations of such authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our or any future development partners\u2019 clinical data insufficient for approval.\nWith respect to foreign markets, approval procedures vary widely among countries and, in addition to the aforementioned risks, can involve additional product testing, administrative review periods, and agreements with pricing authorities. In addition, events raising questions about the safety of certain marketed pharmaceuticals may result in increased caution by FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in reviewing new drugs based on safety, efficacy or other regulatory considerations and may result in significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approvals may delay or prevent us or any future development partners from commercializing our product candidates.\nIf we receive regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing FDA obligations and continued regulatory oversight and review, such as continued safety reporting requirements, and we may also be subject to additional FDA post-marketing obligations. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our product candidates, may be subject to product recalls, import and export restrictions or seizures, and/or may be subject to civil and/or criminal penalties.\nThe results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials are not always predictive of future results. Any product candidate we or any future development partners advance into clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials, if any, or receive regulatory approval.\nDrug development has substantial inherent risk. We or any future development partners will be required to demonstrate through adequate and well-controlled clinical trials that our product candidates are effective, with a favorable benefit-risk profile, for use in their target populations for their intended indications before we can seek regulatory approvals for their commercial sale. Drug development is a long, expensive and uncertain process, and delay or failure can occur at any stage of development, including after commencement of any of our clinical trials. Success in early clinical trials does not mean that later clinical trials will be successful because product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety or efficacy despite having progressed through initial clinical testing. Furthermore, our future trials will need to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy for approval by regulatory authorities in larger patient populations. Companies frequently suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials have shown promising results. In addition, only a small percentage of drugs under development result in the submission of an NDA or BLA to FDA, and even fewer are approved for commercialization.\nWe face risks associated with clinical operations abroad, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, and we may not be able to receive conditional marketing or other approvals for lenzilumab in COVID-19 patients in markets outside the U.S.\nPartners are conducting or planning to conduct clinical trials involving lenzilumab in the UK, Korea and Australia, as well as potentially in other countries in patients with COVID-19 and other indications. In addition, we are working to seek CMA for lenzilumab in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the European Union and the United Kingdom. We have not received any authorization or approval to sell lenzilumab in any country but would expect to commence commercial operations, through a partner or on our own, only after such authorization or approval were received. As with our development programs in the U.S., our product candidates must be approved for marketing and sale by regulatory authorities in each jurisdiction to which we may apply for approval and, once approved, are subject to extensive regulation by regulatory agencies in other countries. We anticipate that we may file for marketing approval in additional countries and for additional indications and products over the next several years. These and any future marketing applications we file may not be approved by the regulatory authorities on a timely basis, or at all. Even if marketing approval is granted for these products, there may be significant limitations on their use. We cannot state with certainty when or whether any of our product candidates under development will be approved by any foreign regulators or launched; whether we will be able to develop, license or acquire additional product candidates or products; or whether any products, once launched, will be commercially successful.\nInternational operations involve risks that are different from those faced in the U.S. and would subject us to complex and frequently changing laws and regulations, including differing labor laws, such as the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) Modern Slavery Act. In addition, operations abroad are accompanied by certain financial, political, economic and other risks, including those listed below:\n\u00b7 Foreign Currency Exchange: Operations internationally may subject us to risks related to foreign currency exchange risks as we make payments, or incur obligations, denominated in foreign currencies. We cannot predict future fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of the U.S. dollar. If the U.S. dollar appreciates significantly against certain currencies and our practices do not sufficiently offset the effects of such appreciation, our results of operations would be adversely affected, and our stock price may decline.\n\u00b7 Anti-Bribery: We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws that will govern our international operations with respect to payments to government officials. Our international operations would be heavily regulated and require significant interaction with foreign officials. In certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices or may require us to interact with doctors and hospitals, some of which may be state controlled, in a manner that is different than local custom. In addition, despite our efforts, our policies and procedures may not protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by persons who act on our behalf. Enforcement activities under anti-bribery laws could subject us to administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could result in civil and criminal sanctions, including monetary penalties and exclusion from health care programs.\nOther risks inherent in conducting foreign operations include:\n\u00b7 International operations, including any use of third-party manufacturers, distributors, CROs and collaboration arrangements outside the U.S., expose us to increased risk of theft of our intellectual property and other proprietary technology, particularly in jurisdictions with less robust intellectual property protections than the U.S., as well as restrictive government actions against our intellectual property and other foreign assets such as nationalization, expropriation or the imposition of compulsory licenses.\n\u00b7 We may be subject to protective economic policies taken by foreign governments, such as trade protection measures and import and export licensing requirements, which may result in the imposition of trade sanctions or similar restrictions by the U.S. or other governments.\n\u00b7 Our foreign operations, third-party manufacturers, CROs or strategic partners could be subject to business interruptions for which we or they may be uninsured or inadequately insured.\n\u00b7 Our operations may also be adversely affected if there is political instability or disruption in any other geographic region where we may have operations, which could impact our ability to do business in those areas.\nIf we were to encounter any of these risks, our foreign operations may be adversely affected, which could have an adverse effect on our overall business and results of operations.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key management and clinical development personnel, or if the attention of such personnel is diverted, we may be unable to successfully manage our business and develop or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe will need to effectively manage our managerial, operational, financial, and other resources in order to successfully pursue our clinical development and commercialization efforts. As a company with a limited number of personnel, we are heavily affected by turnover and highly dependent on the expertise of the members of our senior management. If we are unable to provide competitive compensation to these employees, it may be difficult to retain them. For 2021, the Board of Directors froze the salary levels of all but one employee who was promoted and did not award any cash bonuses for 2021 performance, opting instead to grant options to employees to purchase shares of common stock in satisfaction of amounts earned under the Company's 2021 annual incentive plan. There can be no assurance that these decisions will not have a negative impact on the retention of our employees. Furthermore, we rely on third party consultants for a variety of services. We cannot predict the impact of the loss of such individuals or the loss of services of any of our other senior management, should they occur, or the difficulty in replacing such individuals. Such losses could delay or prevent the further development and potential commercialization of our product candidates and, if we are not successful in finding suitable replacements, could harm our business.\nIf our competitors develop similar or comparable treatments for the target indications of our product candidates that are approved more quickly, marketed more successfully or are demonstrated to be safer or more effective than our product candidates, or if FDA approves generic or biosimilar competitors to our products post-approval, our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated.\nWe compete in an industry characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, a changing regulatory and legislative landscape and a strong emphasis on the benefits of intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivities. Our competitors include pharmaceutical companies, other biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other private and public research organizations. We compete with these parties in immunotherapy and oncology treatments and in recruiting highly qualified personnel. Our product candidates, if successfully developed and approved, may compete with established therapies, with new treatments that may be introduced by our competitors, including competitors relying on our biologics approvals under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act, or with generic copies of our products approved by FDA under an abbreviated new drug application (\u201cANDA\u201d), referencing our drug products. We believe that competitors are actively developing competing products to our product candidates. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Competition\u201d for a discussion of competition with respect to our current product candidates.\nMany of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater scientific, research, and product development capabilities, as well as greater financial, marketing, sales and human resources capabilities than we do. In addition, many specialized biotechnology firms have formed collaborations with large, established companies to support the research, development and commercialization of products that may be competitive with ours. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful with respect to their products than we may be in developing, commercializing, and achieving widespread market acceptance for our products. If a competitor obtains approval for an orphan drug that is the same drug or the same biologic as one of our candidates before we do, we will be blocked from obtaining FDA approval for seven years from the date of the competitor\u2019s product, unless we can establish that our product is clinically superior to the previously-approved competitor\u2019s product or we can meet another exception, such as by showing that the competitor has failed to provide an adequate supply of its product to patients after approval. In addition, our competitors\u2019 products may be more effective or more effectively marketed and sold than any treatment we or our development partners may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses related to developing and supporting the commercialization of any of our product candidates. Developments by competitors may render our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. After one of our product candidates is approved, FDA may also approve a generic version with the same dosage form, safety, strength, route of administration, quality, performance characteristics and intended use as our product. These generic equivalents would be less costly to bring to market and could generally be offered at lower prices, thereby limiting our ability to gain or retain market share.\nThe acquisition or licensing of pharmaceutical products is also very competitive, and a number of more established companies, which have acknowledged strategies to in-license or acquire products, may have competitive advantages as may other emerging companies taking similar or different approaches to product acquisitions. The more established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash flows, institutional experience and historical corporate reputation.\nWe are subject to a multitude of manufacturing risks, any of which could substantially increase our costs and limit supply of our products and rely completely on third parties to manufacture drug product, which could adversely impact our business.\nThe process of manufacturing our products is complex, costly, highly regulated, and subject to several risks. As such, we have no present plan or intention of developing in-house manufacturing capabilities for nonclinical, clinical or commercial scale production, and are wholly dependent on third party contract manufacturers for the timely supply of adequate quantities of our products which meet or exceed requisite quality and production standards for use in clinical and nonclinical studies. Our dependence on CMOs increases our manufacturing risks, including the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the CMO, the possible cancellation, delay or modification of contracted manufacturing slots by the CMO, or the termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the CMO at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us, and could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis. In addition, in order to balance risk and conserve financial and human resources, we have and may continue from time-to-time to defer commitment to production of product, which could result in delays to the continued progress of our clinical and nonclinical testing.\nWe, and our CMOs, must comply with extensive Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d) regulations and are subject to inspections by FDA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. If, as a result of these inspections, a regulatory authority determines that the equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable regulations and conditions of product approval, the regulatory authority may suspend the manufacturing operations. Suppliers of key components and materials must also be named in the EUA, BLA or other marketing authorization application filed with the regulatory authority for any product candidate for which we are seeking marketing approval, and significant delays can occur if the qualification of a new supplier is required. Foreign agencies have not inspected the Catalent site in Madison, WI. This site is the primary source of BDS for lenzilumab.\nWe, and our CMOs, may encounter difficulties in achieving quality control and quality assurance and may experience shortages in qualified personnel. Any failure to follow cGMP or other regulatory requirements or any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, fill-finish, packaging, or storage of our products as a result of a failure of our or our CMOs\u2019 facilities, could significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize our products, including leading to significant delays in the availability of products for our clinical studies or the termination or hold of a clinical study, or the delay or prevention of a filing or approval of marketing applications for our product candidates. Further, we may have to pay the costs of manufacturing any batch produced by a CMO that fails to pass quality inspection or meet regulatory approval.\nSignificant noncompliance with manufacturing regulations could also result in the imposition of sanctions, including injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approvals for our product candidates, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions, adverse publicity, and criminal prosecutions, any of which could damage our reputation. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our products and/or may be subject to product recalls, seizures, injunctions, or criminal prosecution. Any adverse developments affecting manufacturing operations for our products may result in shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls, or other interruptions in the supply of our products. Once our product candidates are approved, we may also have to take inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expenses for products that fail to meet specifications, undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives.\nAs is the case with MHRA, we are required to provide information from the PPQ runs at certain CMOs. It is our belief that lenzilumab manufactured at CMOs that have not completed PPQ will not be available for commercial sale in the UK. Historically, FDA provided guidance that we would not have to complete PPQ at all of our CMOs and that we could rely on compatibility reports to sell product under EUA. We believe EMA may require PPQ information similar to the requirements from MHRA. We do not know if FDA\u2019s position on the PPQ requirement has changed. If FDA requires similar PPQ information, our ability to commercialize a significant amount of the lenzilumab produced to date will be limited.\nIn addition, the manufacturing facilities in which our products are made could be adversely affected by equipment failures, plant closures, capacity constraints, competing customer priorities or changes in corporate strategy or priorities, process changes or failures, changes in business models or operations, materials or labor shortages, natural disasters, power failures and numerous other factors.\nOur third-party manufacturers are independent entities subject to their own unique operational and financial risks that are out of our control. Additionally, our third-party manufacturers may only be able to produce some of our products at one or a limited number of facilities and, therefore, we have limited manufacturing capacity for certain products, and we may not be able to locate additional or replacement facilities on a reasonable basis or at all. Our sales of such products could also be adversely impacted by our reliance on such limited number of facilities. To the extent these risks materialize and affect their performance obligations to us, our financial results may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we, our third-party suppliers and our CMOs have experienced disruptions in supply of product candidates and/or procuring items that are essential for our research, development and manufacturing activities, including raw materials and components used in the manufacturing of our product candidates for which there have been shortages because of ongoing efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic. These delays have impacted our overall manufacturing supply chain operations to date, and while we continue to explore back up or alternative sources of supply, any future disruption in the supply chain from the COVID-19 outbreak, or any continued outbreak, could have a material adverse impact on our clinical trial plans, manufacturing activities and business operations.\nIf any product candidate that we successfully develop does not achieve broad market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payers and the medical community, the revenue that it generates may be limited.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payers, and the medical community. Coverage and reimbursement of our product candidates by third-party payers, including government payers, generally is also necessary for commercial success. The degree of market acceptance of any approved product candidates will depend on several factors, including:\n\u00b7 the efficacy and safety as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u00b7 the clinical indications for which the product candidate is approved;\n\u00b7 acceptance by physicians, major operators of hospitals and clinics, and patients of the product candidate as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u00b7 the potential and perceived advantages of product candidates over alternative treatments;\n\u00b7 the safety of product candidates seen in a broader patient group, including its use outside the approved indications;\n\u00b7 the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7 the availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by payers;\n\u00b7 relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u00b7 the prevalence and severity of adverse events;\n\u00b7 the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts; and\n\u00b7 the ability to manage any unfavorable publicity relating to the product candidate.\nIf any product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, hospitals, healthcare payers, and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from that product candidate and may not become or remain commercially attractive as a standalone indication for that product.\nReimbursement may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments for our product candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell our product candidates profitably.\nMarket acceptance and sales of our product candidates will depend significantly on the availability of adequate insurance coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers for any of our product candidates and may be affected by existing and future health care reform measures. Government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Reimbursement by a third-party payer may depend upon a number of factors including the third-party payer\u2019s determination that use of a product candidate is:\n\u00b7 a covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u00b7 safe, effective, and medically necessary;\n\u00b7 appropriate for the specific patient;\n\u00b7 cost-effective; and\n\u00b7 neither experimental nor investigational.\nObtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product candidate from a government or other third-party payer is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical, and cost effectiveness data for the use of our product candidates to the payer. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement. We cannot be sure that coverage or adequate reimbursement will be available for any of our product candidates. Also, we cannot be sure that reimbursement amounts will not reduce the demand for, or the price of, our product candidates. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels or with restrictions, we may not be able to commercialize certain of our product candidates profitably, or at all, even if approved.\nIn the U.S. and in certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the health care system that could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably. In particular, the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 revised the payment methods for many product candidates under Medicare. This has resulted in lower rates of reimbursement. There have been numerous other federal and state initiatives designed to reduce payment for pharmaceuticals.\nAs a result of legislative proposals and the trend toward managed health care in the U.S., third-party payers are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs. They may also refuse to provide coverage of approved product candidates for medical indications other than those for which FDA has granted market approvals. As a result, significant uncertainty exists as to whether and how much third-party payers will reimburse patients for their use of newly approved drugs, which in turn will put pressure on the pricing of drugs. We could be subject to pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our product candidates due to the trend toward managed health care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative proposals as well as country, regional, or local healthcare budget limitations. Similar concerns about the costs of treatment have been raised in Europe and the United Kingdom.\nWe face potential product liability exposure and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability for a product candidate and may have to limit its commercialization.\nThe use of our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval expose us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims may be brought against us or any future development partners by participants enrolled in our clinical trials, patients, health care providers, or others using, administering, or selling our product candidates. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against any such claims, or have insufficient insurance protection, we would incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7 withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7 termination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n\u00b7 costs of related litigation;\n\u00b7 substantial monetary awards to trial participants or other claimants;\n\u00b7 decreased demand for our product candidates and loss of revenue;\n\u00b7 impairment of our business reputation;\n\u00b7 diversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations; and\n\u00b7 the inability to commercialize our product candidates.\nWe have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials domestically and in selected foreign countries where we are conducting clinical trials. As such, our insurance coverage may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for all expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to product liability. We intend to expand our insurance coverage for product candidates to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates in development; however, we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any product candidates approved for marketing. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us, particularly if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our working capital and adversely affect our business.\nOur employees and consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees or consultants could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities, failure to provide accurate information to FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, failure to comply with manufacturing standards, failure to comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable foreign regulatory authorities, failure to report financial information or data accurately, violations of anti-bribery laws, or failure to disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee or consultant misconduct could also involve the improper use of confidential information obtained in the course of our business, which could result in civil or criminal legal actions, regulatory sanctions, or serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other corporate policies, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nWe may encounter difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully.\nAs we seek to advance our product candidates through clinical trials, we will need to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, and sales capabilities, and contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us. As our operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with various development partners, suppliers, and other third parties. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend in part on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to manage our development efforts and clinical trials effectively. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks and our failure to accomplish any of them could prevent us from successfully growing our company.\nWe and any current or future development partners, third-party manufacturers and suppliers may use hazardous materials, and any claims relating to improper handling, storage, or disposal of these materials could be time consuming or costly.\nWe and any current or future development partners, third-party manufacturers and suppliers may use hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological agents and compounds that could be dangerous to human health and safety or the environment. Our operations and the operations of our development partners, third-party manufacturers and suppliers also produce hazardous waste products. Federal, state, and local laws and regulations govern the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of these materials and wastes. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive and current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our product development efforts. In addition, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials or wastes. We do not carry specific biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage and our property, casualty, and general liability insurance policies specifically exclude coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination. Accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury we could be held liable for damages or be penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources, and our clinical trials or regulatory approvals could be suspended.\nLegislative or regulatory healthcare reforms in the U.S. may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates and to produce, market, and distribute our products after approval is obtained.\nFrom time-to-time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory approval, manufacture, and marketing of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of our current product candidates or any future product candidates. There have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of health care and containing or lowering the overall cost of health care. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations, and other payers of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of health care may adversely affect:\n\u00b7 the demand for any drug products for which we may obtain regulatory approval;\n\u00b7 our ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our product candidates;\n\u00b7 our ability to gain reimbursement at commercially acceptable levels;\n\u00b7 our ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability;\n\u00b7 the level of taxes that we are required to pay; and\n\u00b7 the availability of capital.\nIn addition, such changes could, among other things, require:\n\u00b7 changes to manufacturing methods;\n\u00b7 additional studies, including clinical studies;\n\u00b7 recall, replacement, or discontinuance of one or more of our products; and\n\u00b7 additional record-keeping.\nEach of these would likely entail substantial time and cost and could materially harm our business and our financial results. In addition, delays in receipt of or failure to receive regulatory approvals for any future products would harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe and any of our future development partners will be required to report to regulatory authorities if any of our approved products cause or contribute to adverse medical events, and any failure to do so would result in sanctions that would materially harm our business.\nIf we and any future development partners are successful in commercializing our products, FDA and foreign regulatory authorities would require that we and any future development partners report certain information about adverse medical events if those products may have caused or contributed to those adverse events. The timing of our obligation to report would be triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We and any future development partners may fail to report adverse events we become aware of within the prescribed timeframe. We and any future development partners may also fail to appreciate that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of our products. If we and any future development partners fail to comply with our reporting obligations, FDA or a foreign regulatory authority could take action including criminal prosecution, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, seizure of our products, or delay in approval or clearance of future products.\nOur product candidates for which we intend to seek approval as biologic products may face competition sooner than anticipated.\nWith the enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or the BPCIA, as part of the Affordable Care Act, an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products was created. The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as \u2018\u2018interchangeable\u2019\u2019 based on its similarity to an existing brand product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by FDA until 12 years after the original branded product was approved under a BLA. The law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning are subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when such processes intended to implement BPCIA may be fully adopted by FDA, any such processes could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products.\nWe believe that any of our product candidates, such as lenzilumab, iFab and/or HGEN005, if approved as biological products under a BLA, should qualify for the 12-year period of exclusivity. However, there is a risk that FDA will not consider our product candidates to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for biosimilar competition sooner than anticipated. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. Finally, there is a risk that the 12-year exclusivity period could be reduced which could negatively affect our products.\nIn addition, foreign regulatory authorities may also provide for exclusivity periods for approved biological products. For example, biological products in Europe may be eligible for a 10-year period of exclusivity. However, biosimilar products have been approved under a sub-pathway of the centralized procedure since 2006. The pathway allows sponsors of a biosimilar product to seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on the clinical trial data of an originator product to which the biosimilar product has been demonstrated to be \u2018\u2018similar.\u2019\u2019 In many cases, this allows biosimilar products to be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials typically required of originators. It is unclear whether we and any future development partners would face competition to our products in European markets sooner than anticipated.\nWe may in the future be subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and fraud laws, and any violations by us of such laws could result in fines or other penalties.\nIf one or more of our product candidates is approved, we will likely be subject to the various U.S. federal and state laws intended to prevent health care fraud and abuse. The federal anti-kickback statute prohibits the offer, receipt, or payment of remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of patients or the use of products or services that would be paid for in whole or part by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal health care programs. Remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced-price items and services. Many states have similar laws that apply to their state health care programs as well as private payers. Violations of the anti-kickback laws can result in exclusion from federal health care programs and substantial civil and criminal penalties.\nThe False Claims Act imposes liability on persons who, among other things, present or cause to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal health care program. The False Claims Act has been used to prosecute persons submitting claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, that are for services not provided as claimed, or for services that are not medically necessary. The False Claims Act includes a whistleblower provision that allows individuals to bring actions on behalf of the federal government and share a portion of the recovery of successful claims. If our marketing or other arrangements were determined to violate the False Claims Act or anti-kickback or related laws, then our revenue could be adversely affected, which would likely harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nState and federal authorities have aggressively targeted medical technology companies for alleged violations of these anti-fraud statutes, based on improper research or consulting contracts with doctors, certain marketing arrangements that rely on volume-based pricing, off-label marketing schemes, and other improper promotional practices. Companies targeted in such prosecutions have paid substantial fines in the hundreds of millions of dollars or more, have been forced to implement extensive corrective action plans or corporate integrity agreements, and have often become subject to consent decrees severely restricting the manner in which they conduct their business. If we become the target of such an investigation or prosecution based on our contractual relationships with providers or institutions, or our marketing and promotional practices, we could face similar sanctions, which would materially harm our business.\nEven if regulatory authorization or approval were received for lenzilumab or any other product candidate, the later discovery of previously unknown problems associated with the use of lenzilumab or other product may result in restrictions, including withdrawal of the product from the market, and lead to significant liabilities and reputational damage.\nSerious adverse or undesirable side effects may emerge or be identified during later stages of development of our products that were not observed in earlier stages. If our product candidates, either alone or in combination with other therapeutics, are associated with serious adverse events or undesirable side effects or unacceptable drug interactions in clinical trials or have characteristics that are unexpected in clinical trials or preclinical testing, we may need to abandon their development or limit development to more narrow uses or subpopulations in which the serious adverse events, undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. In pharmaceutical development, many compounds that initially show promise in early-stage or clinical testing are later found to cause side effects that prevent further development of the compound. In addition, if third parties manufacture or use our product candidates without our permission, and generate adverse events or unacceptable side effects, this could also have an adverse impact on our development efforts.\nUnacceptable adverse events caused by any of our product candidates that we advance into clinical trials could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay, or halt clinical trials and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the applicable regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications and markets. This in turn could prevent us from completing development or commercializing the affected product candidate and generating revenue from its sale. We have not yet successfully completed testing of any of our product candidates for the treatment of the indications for which we intend to seek approval in humans, and we currently do not know the extent of adverse events, if any, that will be observed in individuals who receive any of our product candidates. Even if lenzilumab or any other products are approved, if previously unknown problems with the product or its manufacture are subsequently discovered, we may be restricted or prohibited from marketing or manufacturing such product and/or may be subject to substantial liabilities, which may adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and our financial condition.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be subject to certain limitations.\nWe have incurred substantial losses during our history and do not expect to become profitable in the foreseeable future and may never achieve profitability. To the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire. We may be unable to use these losses to offset income before such unused losses expire. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted in 2017, limited the use of net operating loss carryforwards for periods beginning after 2017 to eighty percent of taxable income in the period to which the losses were carried. However, this limitation on the use of the carryforwards was eliminated by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES\u201d Act) for tax years beginning before January 1, 2021. In addition, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, may limit the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards. Under Section 382, if a corporation undergoes an \u2018\u2018ownership change\u2019\u2019 (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have recently and in the past experienced ownership changes that have resulted in limitations on the use of a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards. If we experience further ownership changes our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards could be further limited.\nWe rely completely on third parties to supply drug substance and manufacture drug product for our clinical trials and preclinical studies and intend to rely on other third parties to produce commercial supplies of product candidates, and our dependence on third parties could adversely impact our business.\nWe are dependent on third-party suppliers. If our third-party suppliers do not supply sufficient quantities for product candidates to us on a timely basis and in accordance with applicable specifications and other regulatory requirements including PPQ, we may be unable to supply our product candidates in development for clinical trials or ship them to customers, if authorized or approved for commercial use. In addition, as further discussed above, our third-party suppliers have experienced disruptions in supply of product and/or procuring essential items as a result of supply chain issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We regularly evaluate potential alternate sources of supply of raw materials, various components used in production, drug substance and drug product, but there can be no assurance that any such suppliers would be available, acceptable, or successful.\nWe will also rely on our CMOs to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce our product candidates for our anticipated clinical trials. There are a small number of suppliers for certain capital equipment and raw materials used to manufacture our product candidates. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by our contract manufacturers. Moreover, we currently do not have agreements in place for the commercial production of these raw materials. Any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate or the raw material components thereof for an ongoing clinical trial could considerably delay completion of that clinical trial, product candidate testing, and potential regulatory approval of that product candidate.\nIn addition, a significant portion of the raw materials and intermediates used to manufacture our product candidates are supplied by third-party manufacturers and corporate partners outside of the U.S. As a result, any political or economic factors in a specific country or region, including any changes in or interpretations of trade regulations, compliance requirements or tax legislation, that would limit or prevent third parties outside of the U.S. from supplying these materials could adversely affect our ability to conduct our pending or contemplated clinical trials.\nWe may not be successful in establishing and maintaining development partnerships and licensing agreements, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize product candidates.\nPart of our strategy is to enter into development partnerships and licensing agreements. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate partners and the negotiation process is time consuming and complex. Even if we are successful in securing a development partnership, we may not be able to continue it. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a development partnership or other alternative arrangements for any of our other existing or future product candidates and programs because, among other reasons, our research and development pipeline may be insufficient, our product candidates and programs may be deemed to be at too early a stage of development for collaborative effort and/or third parties may not view our product candidates and programs as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Even if we are successful in our efforts to establish new development partnerships, the terms that we agree upon may not be favorable to us and we may not be able to maintain such development partnerships if, for example, development or approval of a product candidate is delayed or sales of an approved product candidate are disappointing. In addition, our ability to enforce our partners\u2019 obligations under any future collaboration efforts may be limited due to time and resource constraints, competing corporate priorities of our future partners, and other factors.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain additional development partnerships related to our product candidates:\n\u00b7 the development and commercialization of our current or future product candidates may be terminated or delayed;\n\u00b7 our cash expenditures related to development of certain of our current or future product candidates would increase significantly and we may need to seek additional financing;\n\u00b7 we may be required to hire additional employees or otherwise develop expertise, such as sales and marketing expertise, for which we have not budgeted; and\n\u00b7 we will bear all of the risk related to the development of any such product candidates.\nOur or any new partner\u2019s failure to develop, manufacture or effectively commercialize our product would result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and would likely cause our stock price to decline.\nCurrently pending, threatened or future litigation, arbitration, governmental proceedings or inquiries could result in material adverse consequences, including judgments or settlements.\nWe are, or may from time-to-time become, involved in lawsuits and other legal or governmental proceedings. See Item 3. to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding currently pending litigation that could have a material impact on us. Many of these matters raise complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties and complexities, all of which make the matters costly to address. The timing of the final resolutions to any such lawsuits, inquiries, and other legal proceedings is uncertain.\nAdditionally, the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements, either of which could require substantial payments, adversely affecting our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Any judgment against us, the entry into any settlement agreement, or the imposition of any fine could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe terms of our loan agreement with Hercules may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in business or to take certain actions, including to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nOn March 10, 2021, we entered into the Loan and Security Agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc. (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d) with a scheduled maturity date of March 1, 2025. As described in more detail in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Term Loan contains, and any future indebtedness we incur will likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose operating restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best long-term interests.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the Loan Agreement. Upon the occurrence of such an event of default, Hercules may, at its discretion, accelerate and demand payment of all or any part of the outstanding advances, together with a prepayment charge, end of term charge, and all interest due and payable under the Term Loan. Hercules also may seek to realize on the collateral we have pledged as security for the Term Loan. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay the indebtedness. The restrictions and covenants in the Term Loan and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities.\nWe review and explore strategic alternatives on an on-going basis, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or completing any strategic alternative, and any such strategic alternative, including future acquisitions of and investments in new businesses, could impact our business and financial condition.\nWe regularly review strategic alternatives to ensure our current structure optimizes our ability to execute our strategic plan and to maximize stockholder value. The review of strategic alternatives could result in, among other things, a sale, merger, consolidation or business combination, asset divestiture, partnering, licensing or other collaboration agreements, or potential acquisitions of or investments in new businesses or recapitalizations, in one or more transactions, or continuing to operate with our current business plan and strategy. There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in the identification or consummation of any transaction.\nThe process of exploring strategic alternatives may be time consuming, disruptive to our business operations and divert the attention of management, and if we are unable to effectively manage the process or successfully integrate any acquired personnel or operations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We also cannot assure that any potential transaction or other strategic alternative, if identified, evaluated and consummated, will perform as expected, will realize the expected benefits, synergies, or developments or that it will provide greater value to our stockholders than that reflected in our current stock price. Any potential transaction would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among other factors, market conditions, industry trends, the interest of third parties in our business or product candidates and the availability of financing to potential buyers on reasonable terms.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial expenses associated with identifying and evaluating potential strategic alternatives. To the extent we finance any acquisition or other strategic alternative in cash, it would reduce our cash reserves, and to the extent the purchase price is paid with shares of our common or preferred stock, it could be dilutive to our current stockholders. To the extent we finance any acquisition or investment with the proceeds from the incurrence of debt, this would increase our level of indebtedness and could negatively affect our liquidity, credit rating and restrict our operations. Moreover, we may face contingent liabilities in connection with any acquisitions or investments.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we fail to obtain, maintain and adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or secure rights to patents of others, the value of our intellectual property rights would diminish, and our business and competitive position would suffer.\nOur success, competitive position and future revenues will depend in part on our ability and the abilities of our licensors and licensees to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, methods, processes and other technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We have an active patent protection program that includes filing patent applications on new compounds, formulations, delivery systems and methods of making and using products and prosecuting these patent applications in the U.S. and abroad. As patents issue, we also file continuation applications as appropriate. Although we have taken steps to build what we believe to be a strong patent portfolio, we cannot predict:\n\u00b7 the degree and range of protection any patents will afford us against competitors, including whether third parties find ways to invalidate or otherwise circumvent our licensed patents;\n\u00b7 if and when patents will issue in the U.S. or any other country;\n\u00b7 whether or not others will obtain patents claiming aspects similar to those covered by our licensed patents and patent applications;\n\u00b7 whether we will need to initiate litigation or administrative proceedings to protect our intellectual property rights, which may be costly whether we win or lose;\n\u00b7 whether any of our patents will be challenged by our competitors alleging invalidity or unenforceability and, if opposed or litigated, the outcome of any administrative or court action as to patent validity, enforceability or scope;\n\u00b7 whether a competitor will develop a similar compound that is outside the scope of protection afforded by a patent or whether the patent scope is inherent in the claims modified due to interpretation of claim scope by a court;\n\u00b7 whether there were activities previously undertaken by a licensor that could limit the scope, validity or enforceability of licensed patents and intellectual property; or\n\u00b7 whether a competitor will assert infringement of its patents or intellectual property, whether or not meritorious, and what the outcome of any related litigation or challenge may be.\nOur success also depends upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, our consultants and advisors as well as our licensors, sublicensees and contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how and our inventions for which patents may be unobtainable or difficult to obtain, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements. To this end, we require all employees, consultants and board members to enter into agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. These agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of such information. If any of our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information is disclosed, the value of our trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary rights would be significantly impaired, and our business and competitive position would suffer.\nDue to legal and factual uncertainties regarding the scope and protection afforded by patents and other proprietary rights, we may not have meaningful protection from competition.\nOur long-term success will substantially depend upon our ability to protect our proprietary technologies from infringement, misappropriation, discovery and duplication and avoid infringing the proprietary rights of others. Our patent rights, and the patent rights of biopharmaceutical companies in general, are highly uncertain and include complex legal and factual issues. These uncertainties also mean that any patents that we own or may obtain in the future could be subject to challenge, and even if not challenged, may not provide us with meaningful protection from competition. Patents already issued to us, or our pending applications may become subject to dispute, and any dispute could be resolved against us.\nIf some or all of our or any licensor\u2019s patents expire or are invalidated or are found to be unenforceable, or if some or all of our patent applications do not result in issued patents or result in patents with narrow, overbroad, or unenforceable claims, or claims that are not supported in regard to written description or enablement by the specification, or if we are prevented from asserting that the claims of an issued patent cover a product of a third party, we may be subject to competition from third parties with products in the same class of products as our product candidates or products with the same active pharmaceutical ingredients as our product candidates, including in those jurisdictions in which we have no patent protection.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection for our product candidates, as well as the methods for treating patients in the product indications using these product candidates. We will be able to protect our product candidates and the methods for treating patients in the applicable product indications using these product candidates from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that we or any licensor owns or controls such valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets.\nEven if our product candidates and the methods for treating patients for prescribed indications using these product candidates are covered by valid and enforceable patents and have claims with sufficient scope, disclosure and support in the specification, the patents will provide protection only for a limited amount of time. Our and any licensor\u2019s ability to obtain patents can be highly uncertain and involve complex and in some cases unsettled legal issues and factual questions. Furthermore, different countries have different procedures for obtaining patents, and patents issued in different countries provide different degrees of protection against the use of a patented invention by others. Therefore, if the issuance to us or any licensor, in a given country, of a patent covering an invention is not followed by the issuance, in other countries, of patents covering the same invention, or if any judicial interpretation of the validity, enforceability, or scope of the claims in, or the utility, written description or enablement in, a patent issued in one country is not similar to the interpretation given to the corresponding patent issued in another country, our ability to protect our intellectual property in those countries may be limited. Changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may materially diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nWe may be subject to competition from third parties with products in the same class of products as our product candidates, or products with the same active pharmaceutical ingredients as our product candidates in those jurisdictions in which we have no patent protection. Even if patents are issued to us or any licensor regarding our product or methods of using them, those patents can be challenged by our competitors who can argue such patents are invalid or unenforceable on a variety of grounds, including lack of utility, lack sufficient written description or enablement, utility, or that the claims of the issued patents should be limited or narrowly construed. Patents also will not protect our product candidates if competitors devise ways of making or using these products without legally infringing our patents. The current U.S. regulatory environment may have the effect of encouraging companies to challenge branded drug patents or to create non-infringing versions of a patented product in order to facilitate the approval of ANDAs for generic substitutes. These same types of incentives encourage competitors to submit NDAs that rely on literature and clinical data not prepared for or by the drug sponsor, providing another less burdensome pathway to approval.\nIf we infringe the rights of third parties, we could be prevented from selling products and be forced to defend against litigation and pay damages.\nThere is a risk that we may be inadvertently infringing the proprietary rights of third parties because numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields that are the focus of our development and manufacturing efforts. Others might have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our or any licensor\u2019s pending patent applications and issued patents and/or might have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions. In addition, because patent applications take many months to publish and patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us or any licensor, which may later result in issued patents that cover the production, manufacture, synthesis, commercialization, formulation or use of our product candidates. In addition, the production, manufacture, synthesis, commercialization, formulation or use of our product candidates may infringe existing patents of which we are not aware. Defending ourselves against third-party claims, including litigation in particular, would be costly and time consuming and would divert management\u2019s attention from our business, which could lead to delays in our development or commercialization efforts. If third parties are successful in their claims, we might have to pay substantial damages or take other actions that are adverse to our business.\nIf our products, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and may have to:\n\u00b7 obtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u00b7 redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement, which may not be possible or could require substantial funds and time;\n\u00b7 stop using the subject matter claimed in patents held by others, which could cause us to lose the use of one or more of our drug candidates;\n\u00b7 pay damages royalties, or other amounts; or\n\u00b7 grant a cross license to our patents to another patent holder.\nWe expect that, as our drug candidates move further into clinical trials and commercialization and our public profile is raised, we will be more likely to be subject to such claims.\nWe may fail to comply with any of our obligations under existing agreements pursuant to which we license or have otherwise acquired rights or technology, which could result in the loss of rights or technology that are material to our business.\nWe are a party to technology licenses and have acquired certain assets and rights that are important to our business and we may enter into additional licenses or acquire additional assets and rights in the future. We currently hold licenses from Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (\u201cLICR\u201d), BioWa, Inc. (\u201cBioWa\u201d), Lonza Sales AG (\u201cLonza\u201d), Mayo Foundation (\u201cMayo\u201d) and the University of Zurich (\u201cUZH\u201d). These licenses impose various commercial, contingent payments, royalty, insurance, indemnification, and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license or take back rights or assets, in which event we would lose valuable rights under our collaboration agreements, potential claims and our ability to develop product candidates.\nWe may be subject to claims that our consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their other clients or former employers to us.\nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, we engage the services of consultants to assist us in the development of our product candidates. Many of these consultants were previously employed at or may have previously or may be currently providing consulting services to, other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may become subject to claims that our company or a consultant inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other information proprietary to their former employers or their former or current clients. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management team.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and we intend to seek patent protection only in selected countries. Our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the U.S. can be less extensive than those in the U.S. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the U.S. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the U.S., or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the U.S. or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the U.S. These products may compete with our product candidates and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares are eligible to be sold into the market in the near future, which could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our future ability to obtain capital, especially through an offering of equity securities. In addition, holders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock have rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders.\nWe have also entered into a Controlled Equity OfferingSM Sales Agreement (the \u201cSales Agreement\u201d) with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (\u201cCantor\u201d), under which we may issue and sell from time-to-time shares of common stock through Cantor, as sales agent. Sales of a substantial number of shares under the Sales Agreement, or the perception that those sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. See Notes 8 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Sales Agreement and our sales of common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement.\nFurther, certain shares of our common stock that are currently outstanding but have not been registered for resale may currently be sold under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or the Securities Act. Sales of a substantial number of these shares in the public market, or the perception that those sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nDespite our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained, and the Nasdaq Capital Market may subsequently delist our common stock if we fail to comply with ongoing listing standards.\nThe Nasdaq Capital Market\u2019s rules for listed companies require us to meet certain financial, public float, bid price and liquidity standards on an ongoing basis in order to continue the listing of our common stock. In addition to specific listing and maintenance standards, the Nasdaq Capital Market has broad discretionary authority over the continued listing of securities, which it could exercise with respect to the listing of our common stock.\nAs a listed company, we are required to meet the continued listing requirements applicable to all Nasdaq Capital Market companies. If we fail to meet those standards, as applied by the Nasdaq Capital Market in its discretion, our common stock may be subject to delisting. We intend to take all commercially reasonable actions to maintain our Nasdaq listing. If our common stock is delisted in the future, it is not likely that we will be able to list our common stock on another national securities exchange and, as a result, we expect our securities would be quoted on an over-the-counter market; however, if this were to occur, our stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences, including limited availability of market quotations for our common stock and reduced liquidity for the trading of our securities. In addition, in the event of such delisting, we could experience a decreased ability to issue additional securities and obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as \u201ccovered securities.\u201d Because our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, shares of our common stock qualify as covered securities under the statute. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. Further, if we were no longer listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, our securities would not qualify as covered securities under the statute, and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.\nFurther, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for our common stock will be sustained despite our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nRaising additional funds by issuing securities or through licensing or lending arrangements may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, the share ownership of existing stockholders will be diluted. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance could result in further dilution to our stockholders by causing a reduction in their proportionate ownership and voting power.\nAny future debt financing may involve covenants that restrict our operations, including, among other restrictions, limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, redeem our stock, make certain investments, and engage in certain merger, consolidation, or asset sale transactions. In addition, if we raise additional funds through licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to grant potentially valuable rights to our product candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nAny material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we may identify in the future could adversely affect investor confidence, impair the value of our common stock and increase our cost of raising capital.\nIf we were to identify any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting in the future, our operating results might be harmed, we may fail to meet our reporting obligations or fail to prevent or detect material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could, in turn, affect the future ability of our management to certify that internal control over our financial reporting is effective. Inferior internal control over financial reporting could also subject us to the scrutiny of the SEC and other regulatory bodies which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or stockholder litigation, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, could reduce the market\u2019s confidence in our financial statements and harm our share price. Furthermore, deficiencies could result in future non-compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Such non-compliance could subject us to a variety of administrative sanctions, including review by the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nWe have never paid and do not intend to pay cash dividends and, consequently, the ability to achieve a return on any investment in our common stock will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on any of our capital stock, and we currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. Therefore, a holder of our stock is not likely to receive any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Since we do not intend to pay dividends, the ability to receive a return on an investment in our common stock will depend on any future appreciation in the market value of our common stock. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate or even maintain the price at which it was purchased.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law, could discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the \u201cCharter\u201d), and our Second Amended and Restated Bylaws (the \u201cBylaws\u201d) may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. Our Charter and Bylaws:\n\u00b7 provide that vacancies on our board of directors, including newly created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u00b7 do not provide stockholders with the ability to cumulate their votes; and\n\u00b7 require advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals.\nIn addition, our Charter permits the Board to issue up to 25 million shares of preferred stock with such powers, rights, terms and conditions as may be designated by the Board upon the issuance of shares of preferred stock at one or more times in the future. Specifically, the Charter permits the Board to approve the future issuance of all or any shares of the preferred stock in one or more series, to determine the number of shares constituting any series and to determine any voting powers, conversion rights, dividend rights, and other designations, preferences, limitations, restrictions and rights relating to such shares without any further authorization by our stockholders. The Board\u2019s power to issue preferred stock could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of our company that might otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our third-party vendors, collaborators or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs, compromise sensitive information related to our business or prevent us from accessing critical information, potentially exposing us to liability or otherwise adversely affecting our business.\nOur internal computer systems and those of our current and any future third-party vendors, collaborators and other contractors or consultants are vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses, computer hackers, malicious code, employee theft or misuse, denial-of-service attacks, sophisticated nation-state and nation-state-supported actors, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we seek to protect our information technology systems from system failure, accident and security breach, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a disruption of our development programs and our business operations, whether due to a loss of our trade secrets or other proprietary information or other disruptions. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. If we were to experience a significant cybersecurity breach of our information systems or data, the costs associated with the investigation, remediation and potential notification of the breach to counterparties and data subjects could be material. In addition, our remediation efforts may not be successful. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology and cybersecurity infrastructure, we could suffer significant business disruption, including transaction errors, supply chain or manufacturing interruptions, processing inefficiencies, data loss or the loss of or damage to intellectual property or other proprietary information.\nTo the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our or our third-party vendors\u2019, collaborators\u2019 or other contractors\u2019 or consultants\u2019 data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability including litigation exposure, penalties and fines, we could become the subject of regulatory action or investigation, our competitive position could be harmed and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed. Any of the above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nOur insurance policies are expensive and protect us only from some business risks, which leaves us exposed to significant uninsured liabilities.\nWe do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter. Some of the policies we currently maintain include general liability, employment practices liability, property, inventory and cargo, auto, workers\u2019 compensation, products liability, and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance. We do not know, however, if we will be able to maintain existing insurance with adequate levels of coverage. Any significant, uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect our working capital and results of operations.\nChanges in laws or regulations relating to data privacy and security, or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations, or contractual or other obligations relating to data privacy and security, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are, and may increasingly become, subject to various laws and regulations, as well as contractual obligations, relating to data privacy and security in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The regulatory environment related to data privacy and security is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. These laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and it is possible that they will be interpreted and applied in ways that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nIn the U.S., various federal and state regulators, including governmental agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission, have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws and regulations concerning personal information and data security. In particular, regulations promulgated pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information and require the implementation of safeguards to protect the privacy, integrity and availability of protected health information. Determining whether protected health information has been handled in compliance with applicable privacy standards and our contractual obligations can be complex and may be subject to changing interpretation. If we fail to comply with applicable HIPAA privacy and security standards, we could face civil and criminal penalties. In addition, state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations that threaten the privacy of state residents. We cannot be sure how these regulations will be interpreted, enforced or applied to our operations.\nCertain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to personal information than federal, international, or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other, all of which may complicate compliance efforts. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which increases privacy rights for California residents and imposes obligations on companies that process their personal information, came into effect on January 1, 2020. Among other things, the CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and provide such consumers new data protection and privacy rights, including the ability to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information. This private right of action may increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation.\nOn August 10, 2021, we were notified that the production website used by one of our service providers to prepare for FDA\u2019s decision regarding our EUA request for lenzilumab had been compromised and source code from the website was posted on various internet message boards. Our service provider has taken additional security measures to ensure that drafts and other unapproved materials are no longer visible to the public. Despite additional security measures taken by our service provider, there can be no assurance that their information systems, or any materials prepared in advance by us, or any of our service providers related to potential regulatory decisions would not be compromised, stolen, copied or manipulated. We remind investors that information posted online may be false, misleading or inaccurate. We undertake no obligation to review and/or correct false, misleading, or inaccurate information posted, published or disclosed other than that information made available by us in formal submissions to the SEC.\nInternationally, laws, regulations and standards in many jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, retention, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal information. For example, the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective in May 2018, greatly increased the European Commission\u2019s jurisdictional reach of its laws and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data. EU member states are tasked under the GDPR to enact, and have enacted, certain implementing legislation that adds to and/or further interprets the GDPR requirements and potentially extends our obligations and potential liability for failing to meet such obligations. The GDPR, together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the EU member states governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, use, retain, protect, disclose, transfer and otherwise process personal data. In particular, the GDPR includes obligations and restrictions concerning the consent and rights of individuals to whom the personal data relates, the transfer of personal data out of the European Economic Area, security breach notifications and the security and confidentiality of personal data. The GDPR authorizes fines for certain violations of up to 4% of global annual revenue or \u20ac20 million, whichever is greater.\nAll of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs, such as costs related to organizational changes, implementing additional protection technologies, training associates and engaging consultants, which are likely to increase over time. In addition, such requirements may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies, distract management or divert resources from other initiatives and projects, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with any applicable federal, state or similar foreign laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security could result in damage to our reputation and our relationship with our customers, as well as proceedings or litigation by governmental agencies or customers, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions, which would subject us to significant fines, sanctions, awards, penalties or judgments, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.", "PERMNO": 13755, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "HGEN"}
