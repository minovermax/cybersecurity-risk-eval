You should consider carefully the risks described below, together with the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We have generated no revenue to date and may never generate revenue or achieve profitability.\nOur ability to implement our business strategy is subject to numerous risks that you should be aware of before making an investment decision. These are not the only risks we face. These risks include, among others, that:\n\u25cf we are a medical device and biopharmaceutical company with only one FDA-approved product and a limited operating history on which to assess our business, have incurred significant losses since our inception and incurred a net cash used in operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2022 of approximately $23.1 million. As of March 31, 2022, we have an accumulated deficit of approximately $123.6 million and we anticipate to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future;\n\u25cf we are unable to predict the extent of future losses or when we will become profitable based on the sale of any product, if at all. Even if we succeed in developing and commercializing our approved product or product candidates, we may never generate revenue to sustain profitability;\n\u25cf we have only one FDA-approved product, and we expect that we will need to raise additional funding before we can expect to become profitable from sales of our products;\n\u25cf we are heavily dependent upon the success of our approved product and product candidates (which are in various stages of clinical development), and we cannot provide any assurance that the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities will allow us to conduct further clinical trials;\n\u25cf we are in the process of developing our proprietary NO delivery system, and unexpected delays will adversely impact the timing of our U.S.-based clinical trials and approvals;\n\u25cf we might be unable to develop product candidates that will achieve commercial success in a timely and cost-effective manner, or ever;\n\u25cf our competitors may develop or commercialize products faster or more successfully than us;\n\u25cf because some of the target patient populations of our approved product or product candidates are small, we must be able to successfully identify patients and achieve a significant market share to maintain profitability and growth;\n\u25cf our reliance on third parties to help conduct our preclinical studies, clinical trials and commercial scale manufacturing;\n\u25cf if we are unable to obtain and maintain effective intellectual property rights for our technologies, approved product or current or future product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets; and\n\u25cf our future success depends in part upon our ability to retain our executive and scientific teams, and to attract, retain and motivate other qualified personnel.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with drug development and commercialization, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. If we are required by regulatory authorities to perform studies in addition to those expected or if there are any delays in the initiation and completion of our clinical trials or the development of any of our product candidates, our expenses could increase.\nIt is highly likely that we will need to raise additional capital to meet our business requirements in the future, and such capital raising may be costly or difficult to obtain, and could dilute current stockholders\u2019 ownership interests.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the success and costs of our commercialization activities, including product marketing, sales, and distribution progress, the results of our clinical trials, the timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates, commercial manufacturing success, and the number and development requirements of product candidates that we pursue. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our approved product and product candidates, we are unable to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional capital outlays and operating expenditures that our business will require. It is likely that we will need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings to meet various objectives including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf commercialization of our approved product;\n\u25cf clinical trials for our product candidates;\n\u25cf researching and developing new products;\n\u25cf pursuing growth opportunities, including more rapid expansion;\n\u25cf acquiring complementary businesses or technologies;\n\u25cf making capital improvements to improve our infrastructure;\n\u25cf hiring qualified management and key employees;\n\u25cf responding to competitive pressures;\n\u25cf complying with regulatory requirements; and\n\u25cf maintaining compliance with applicable laws.\nAny additional capital raised through the sale of equity or equity-linked securities may dilute our current stockholders\u2019 ownership in us and could also result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock. The terms of those securities issued by us in future capital transactions may be more favorable to new investors and may include preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect.\nFurthermore, any debt or equity financing that we may need may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nAdditionally, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which may adversely impact our financial condition.\nIf we are unable to obtain required additional capital, we may have to curtail our growth plans or cut back on existing business, and we may not be able to continue operating if we do not generate sufficient revenues from operations needed to stay in business.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of Our Approved Product or Product Candidates\nIf the market opportunities for our approved product or product candidates are smaller than we believe they are, our revenue may be adversely affected, and our business may suffer.\nOur projections of both the number of people who have our target diseases, as well as the subset of people with these diseases who have the potential to benefit from treatment with LungFit\u00ae PH and our product candidates, are based on our beliefs and estimates. These estimates have been derived from a variety of sources, including the scientific literature, surveys of clinics, patient foundations or market research and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases. The number of patients may turn out to be lower than expected. The effort to identify patients with diseases we seek to treat is in early stages, and we cannot accurately predict the number of patients for whom treatment might be possible. Additionally, the potentially addressable patient population for LungFit\u00ae PH and each of our product candidates may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with LungFit\u00ae PH or our product candidates, and new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business.\nThe insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newly-approved products is uncertain. Failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for new or current products could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate revenue.\nThe pricing, coverage and reimbursement of our approved product and product candidates, if approved, must be adequate to support our commercial infrastructure. Our per-patient prices must be sufficient to recover our development and manufacturing costs and potentially achieve profitability. Accordingly, the availability and adequacy of coverage and reimbursement by governmental and private payors are essential for most patients to be able to afford expensive treatments such as ours, assuming certification or approval. Sales of our approved product and product candidates will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our approved product and product candidates will be paid for by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors. If coverage and reimbursement are not available, or are available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our approved product and product candidates. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a return on our investment.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the U.S., there is no uniform system among payors for making coverage and reimbursement decisions. In addition, the process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product or service may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product or service once coverage is approved. Payors may limit coverage to specific products or services on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved or -cleared products for a particular indication. In the U.S., the principal decisions about coverage and reimbursement for new medical devices are typically made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d), an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as CMS decides whether and to what extent a new device will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare. Private payors tend to, but are not required to, follow the coverage and reimbursement policies established by CMS to a substantial degree. It is difficult to predict what CMS will decide with respect to reimbursement for products such as ours.\nOutside the U.S., international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in the EEA, Canada and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of our approved product or product candidates. In many countries, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In general, the prices of medical devices under such systems are substantially lower than in the U.S. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medical products, but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our approved product or product candidates. Accordingly, in markets outside the U.S., the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the U.S. and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenue and profits.\nMoreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors in the U.S. and abroad to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new products approved and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our approved product and product candidates. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our approved product and product candidates due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products.\nWe face intense competition and rapid technological change and the possibility that our competitors may discover, develop or commercialize therapies that are similar, more advanced or more effective than ours, which may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to successfully commercialize LungFit\u00ae PH and our product candidates.\nWe are working on PPHN which is a highly competitive market. A delivery system with a generator of NO has never been commercialized anywhere in the world, and market acceptance at an appropriate price may prove to be a difficult and lengthy process. The biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device industries are also highly competitive. There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, medical device companies, public and private universities and research organizations actively engaged in the research and development of products that may be similar to LungFit\u00ae PH or our product candidates. We are aware of several companies currently developing and selling NO therapies for various indications such as pulmonary hypertension. For example, Mallinckrodt commercializes INOMAX\u00ae (nitric oxide) for inhalation, which is approved for use to treat newborns suffering from HRF-PPHN, in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Mexico and Japan. Praxair markets a generic version of the Mallinckrodt offering with their delivery system called NOxBOX\u00ae, acquired from Bedfont, in the United States. The Linde Group has marketing rights to INOMAX\u00ae in Europe. Air Liquide sells a similar product in Europe, called VasoKINOX\u2122, together with their delivery platform called OptiKINOX\u2122, for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension that occurs during or after heart surgery. In Europe, Bedfont Scientific Ltd. has a delivery system called NOxBOX\u00ae and Air Products PLC has a gas product called NOXAP\u00ae, each used in delivering inhaled NO formulations. Bellerophon Therapeutics is developing NO-based products for pulmonary arterial hypertension (\u201cPAH\u201d) and pulmonary hypertension associated with COPD. VERO Biotech LLC (formerly known as Geno LLC) received FDA approval for their delivery system GENOSYL DS for PPHN in 2019. In addition, other companies may be developing generic NO formulation delivery systems for various dosages. Ceretec, Inc., a company affiliated with 12th Man Technologies Inc., recently obtained clearance from the FDA to market a NO gas product for use in membrane diffusing capacity testing in pulmonary function laboratories in the U.S. Novoteris, LLC previously received orphan drug designation from the FDA and the EMA for the use of inhaled NO-based treatments in treating CF. SaNOtize has a nitric oxide nasal spray that has received approval in India for preventing COVID-19 after high-risk exposure. Third Pole has reported that they are developing a NO generator and delivery system for use in PPHN and PAH, but we are not aware of any display of any such product at any medical/scientific conference in recent years. Our patents surrounding LungFit\u00ae have a priority date over those of Third Pole.\nIn addition to NO treatments currently available or under development, we also face competition from non-NO-based drugs and therapies. For example, the successful development of immunizations for bronchiolitis may render useless any product we develop for that indication. Also, antibiotic treatments for infections associated with CF and other underlying lung conditions may be preferred over any product that we develop. Even if we successfully develop our product candidates, and obtain certification or approval for them, other treatments may be preferred and we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates.\nSome of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the medical device, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. As a result, these companies may obtain certification or regulatory approval more rapidly than we are able to and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products as well. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis, products that are more effective or less costly than LungFit\u00ae PH or any product candidate that we may develop, or achieve earlier patent protection, certification or regulatory approval, product commercialization and market penetration than we do. Additionally, technologies developed by our competitors may render LungFit\u00ae PH or our potential product candidates uneconomical or obsolete, and we may not be successful in marketing LungFit\u00ae PH or our product candidates against competitors.\nWe currently have a limited marketing and sales organization. If we are unable to fully establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell LungFit\u00ae PH or our product candidates, we may be unable to generate any revenue.\nAlthough our employees may have sold other similar products in the past while employed at other companies, we as a company have no experience selling and marketing our product candidates and we currently have a limited marketing or sales organization. To successfully commercialize LungFit\u00ae PH or any other products that may result from our development programs, we will need to further develop these capabilities, either on our own or with others. If the initial commercialization efforts for LungFit\u00ae PH are successful, we intend to establish a more complete sales and marketing organization with technical expertise to potentially reach all U.S. hospitals using or capable of using NO. This will be expensive, difficult and time consuming. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of our products.\nFurther, given our lack of prior experience in marketing and selling medical device products, our initial estimate of the size of the required sales force may be materially more or less than the size of the sales force actually required to effectively commercialize LungFit\u00ae PH and our product candidates. As such, we may be required to hire substantially more sales representatives to adequately support the commercialization of LungFit\u00ae PH and our product candidates, or we may incur excess costs as a result of hiring more sales representatives than necessary. With respect to certain geographical markets, we may enter into collaborations with other entities to utilize their local marketing and distribution capabilities, but we may be unable to enter into such agreements on favorable terms, if at all. If our future collaborators do not commit sufficient resources to commercialize our future products, if any, and we are unable to develop the necessary marketing capabilities on our own, we will be unable to generate sufficient product revenue to sustain our business. We may be competing with companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations. Without an internal team or the support of a third party to perform marketing and sales functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.\nThe commercial success of LungFit\u00ae PH and any current or future product candidate will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community.\nEven with approval from the FDA and potential future certification or approvals from comparable foreign regulatory authorities, the commercial success of LungFit\u00ae PH and our product candidates will depend in part on the medical community, patients and third-party payors accepting LungFit\u00ae PH and our product candidates as medically useful, cost-effective and safe. Any product that we bring to the market may not gain market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. The degree of market acceptance of LungFit\u00ae PH and any of our product candidates that become approved for commercial sale will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf the safety and efficacy of the product as demonstrated in clinical trials and potential advantages over competing treatments;\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of any side effects, including any limitations or warnings contained in a product\u2019s approved labeling;\n\u25cf The clinical indications for which certification or approval is granted;\n\u25cf relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u25cf the cost of treatment, particularly in relation to competing treatments;\n\u25cf the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u25cf the strength of marketing and distribution support and timing of market introduction of competitive products;\n\u25cf publicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments; and\n\u25cf sufficient third-party insurance coverage and reimbursement.\nEven if a potential product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile in preclinical studies and clinical trials, market acceptance of the product will not be fully known until after it is launched. Our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of the product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful. If our product candidates are approved but fail to achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community, we will not be able to generate sufficient revenue to become or remain profitable.\nIf we fail to properly manage our anticipated growth, our business could suffer.\nOur rapid growth has placed, and will continue to place, a significant strain on our management and on our operational and financial resources and systems. Failure to manage our growth effectively could cause us to over-invest or under-invest in infrastructure, and result in losses or weaknesses in our infrastructure, which could materially adversely affect us. Additionally, our anticipated growth will increase the demands placed on our suppliers, resulting in an increased need for us to carefully monitor for quality assurance. Any failure by us to manage our growth effectively could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals.\nPricing pressure from our competitors and our customers may impact our ability to sell our products at prices necessary to support our current business strategies.\nThe industry is characterized by intense competition, and the market continues to attract numerous new companies and technologies, which has encouraged more established companies to intensify competitive pricing pressure. As a result of this increased competition, as well as the challenges of third-party coverage and reimbursement practices, we believe there will be continued pricing pressure in the future. If competitive forces drive down the prices we are able to charge for our products, our profit margins will shrink, which will adversely affect our ability to maintain our profitability and to invest in and grow our business.\nWe may be subject to enforcement action if we engage in improper marketing or promotion of our products.\nWe are not permitted to promote or market our investigational products. After approval, our promotional materials and training methods must comply with FDA and other applicable laws and regulations, including the prohibition of the promotion of unapproved, or off-label, use. Physicians may use our products off-label, as the FDA does not restrict or regulate a provider\u2019s choice of treatment within the practice of medicine. However, if the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine, or criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state, or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. In that event, our reputation could be damaged and adoption of the products could be impaired. In addition, the off-label use of our products may increase the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in substantial damage awards against us, and harm our reputation.\nCybersecurity risks and the failure to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our computer hardware, software, and Internet applications and related tools and functions could result in harm to our business and/or subject us to costs, fines or lawsuits.\nWe rely on sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure to operate and manage our business. We also maintain personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d) about our employees, and given the nature of our business, we have access to protected health information (PHI). Our business therefore depends on the continuous, effective, reliable, and secure operation of our computer hardware, software, networks, Internet servers, and related infrastructure. To the extent that our hardware or software malfunctions or access to our data by internal personnel, suppliers or customers through the Internet is interrupted or compromised, our business could suffer.\nThe integrity and protection of our customer, personnel, financial, research and development, and other confidential data is critical to our business, and our customers and employees have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. The regulatory environment governing information, security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve and a number of states have adopted laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and data security practices regarding the use, disclosure and protection of PII. For example, California recently enacted legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, that, among other things, creates new individual privacy rights and imposes increased obligations on companies handling PII.\nAlthough our computer and communications hardware is protected through physical and software safeguards, it is still vulnerable to system malfunction, computer viruses, malware and ransomware, and other cybersecurity threats such as phishing and social engineering attacks. These events could lead to the unauthorized access of our information technology systems and result in financial loss and the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us, our employees, partners, customers, or our suppliers. The techniques used by criminal elements to attack computer systems are sophisticated, change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world. As a result, we may not be able to address these techniques proactively or implement adequate preventative measures. If our information technology systems are compromised, we could be subject to fines, damages, litigation and enforcement actions, incur financial losses, suffer reputational damage, and lose trade secrets or other confidential information, each of which could significantly harm our business.\nHealthcare legislative or regulatory reform measures, including government restrictions on pricing and reimbursement, may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nIn the U.S., there have been and continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes to contain healthcare costs. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d) was enacted, which, among other things, substantially changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. medical device industry. Some of the provisions of the ACA have been subject to judicial challenges as well as efforts to modify them or alter their interpretation or implementation. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\u201cTax Act\u201d), includes a provision that eliminated the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate,\u201d effective January 1, 2019. It is unclear how efforts to modify or invalidate the ACA or its implementing regulations, or portions thereof, will affect our business. Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes and judicial challenges related to the ACA remain possible. We cannot predict what effect further changes related to the ACA would have on our business.\nWe cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether government regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes would be on the certification or marketing approvals, sales, pricing, or reimbursement of our approved product or product candidates, if any, may be. We expect that any such healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our approved product or product candidates.\nMoreover, in order to obtain reimbursement for our products in some EEA countries, including some EU Member States, we may be required to compile additional data comparing the cost-effectiveness of our products to other available therapies. Health Technology Assessment (\u201cHTA\u201d) of both medicinal products and medical devices is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU Member States, including those representing the larger markets. The HTA process, which is currently governed by national laws in each EU Member State, is the procedure to assess therapeutic, economic and societal impact of a given medical product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country. The outcome of an HTA will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medical products by the competent authorities of individual EU Member State. The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of the specific medical product currently varies between EU Member States. On December 13, 2021, the EU adopted a new HTA Regulation which entered into force on January 11, 2022 and will become applicable to all EU Member States from January 12, 2025. The new EU HTA regulation aims to harmonize the clinical benefit assessment of HTA across the EU and provides the basis for permanent and sustainable cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas.\nWe are subject to additional federal and state laws and regulations relating to our business, and our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions.\nWe are subject to additional health care regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include the following:\n\u25cf the federal health care program Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, or order or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical or device manufacturers, on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers and others on the other. The term \u201cremuneration\u201d has been broadly interpreted to apply to anything of value including, for example, gifts, cash payments, donations, waivers of payment, ownership interests, and providing any item, service, or compensation for something other than fair market value. Liability under the AKS may be established without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors to the AKS protecting certain common business arrangements and activities from prosecution or regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend medical device products, including certain discounts, or engaging such individuals as consultants, advisors and speakers, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational grants and reimbursement support programs;\n\u25cf the federal civil False Claims Act that prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent, claims for payment of government funds, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false statement or record material to an obligation to pay money to the government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. Actions under the FCA may be brought by the government or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government, who may also share in any monetary recovery. Qui tam actions are filed under seal and impose a mandatory duty on the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate such allegations. Manufacturers have faced liability under the FCA for providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. FCA liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and significant mandatory penalties per false or fraudulent claim or statement for violations, as well as exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs;\n\u25cf HIPAA imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation, or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry, in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services;\n\u25cf the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided (in 2021) to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives; and\n\u25cf analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. Several states have enacted legislation requiring medical device manufacturers to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs; file periodic reports with the state, including reports on gifts and payments to individual health care providers; and/or register their sales representatives. Some states prohibit certain sales and marketing practices, including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to health care providers.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. The scope and enforcement of these laws is uncertain and subject to change in the current environment of health care reform. We cannot predict the impact on our business of any changes in these laws. Federal or state regulatory authorities may challenge our current or future activities under these laws. Any such challenge, even if we are able to successfully defend against it, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. Any state or federal regulatory review of us, regardless of the outcome, would be costly and time-consuming. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable privacy, data protection and data security laws and regulations, we could face substantial penalties, liability and adverse publicity and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations globally regarding privacy and data protection, including laws and regulations relating to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data. The restrictions under applicable privacy, data protection and data security laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include but are not limited to:\n\u25cf HIPAA governs the use, disclosure, and security of protected health information by HIPAA \u201ccovered entities\u201d and their \u201cbusiness associates.\u201d Covered entities are health plans, health care clearinghouses and health care providers that engage in specific types of electronic transactions. A business associate is any person or entity (other than members of a covered entity\u2019s workforce) that performs a service on behalf of a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information. Most healthcare providers who prescribe our products and from whom we obtain patient health information are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA, as are we in certain circumstances. HHS (through the Office for Civil Rights) has direct enforcement authority against covered entities and business associates with regard to compliance with HIPAA regulations. We also could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain individually identifiable health information from a covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA or for aiding and abetting and/or conspiring to commit a violation of HIPAA. We are unable to predict whether our actions could be subject to prosecution in the event of an impermissible disclosure of health information to us;\n\u25cf numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of personal information. These laws may impose a number of compliance obligations on us, including requiring that we obtain consent before we collect, use, or disclose personal information, implement certain security protections to safeguard personal information, and notify individuals or regulators in the event of a breach;\n\u25cf other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use, disclosure and protection of personal information. The GDPR, for example, imposes restrictions on the processing (e.g., collection, use, disclosure) of personal data in the EEA and also imposes strict restrictions on the transfer of personal data out of the EU to the U.S. Our business could be adversely impacted if our ability to transfer personal data outside of the EEA or Switzerland is restricted, which could adversely impact our operating results. For example, in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, or the CJEU, declared the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework between the EU and U.S. to be invalid and raised concerns about other data transfer mechanisms in a case known colloquially as \u201cSchrems II\u201d, which could adversely impact our ability to transfer personal data from the EU to the U.S or otherwise may cause us to incur significant costs to do so legally. At present, there are few viable alternatives to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the Standard Contractual Clauses (\u201cSCCs\u201d). If the level of protection in the U.S. or any other importing country is called into question under the SCCs, this could further impact our ability to transfer data outside of the EEA or Switzerland. Furthermore, following the Brexit and the UK\u2019s exit from the EU, the UK became a third country to the EU in terms of personal data transfers. The European Commission has adopted an Adequacy Decision concerning the level of personal data protection in the UK under which personal data may now flow freely from the EU to the UK. However, personal data transfers from the EU to the UK may nevertheless be at a greater risk than before because the Adequacy Decision could in theory someday be suspended. On March 25, 2022, the European Commission and the U.S. announced that they have agreed in principle on a new Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework, as a successor arrangement to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. The two sides are now expected to finalize the details of this agreement in principle and translate it into legal texts that will form the basis of a draft adequacy decision to be proposed by the European Commission; and\n\u25cf the legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data security continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data security issues with the potential to affect our business. For example, the CCPA contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about California residents and affords those individuals new rights relating to their personal information that may affect our ability to use personal information. Other states, including Virginia, and the federal government, have considered and/or enacted similar privacy laws that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business.\nThese privacy and data security laws and regulations could increase our cost of doing business, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could materially and negatively affect our operating results and business. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws and regulations, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal, state, and foreign privacy and data security laws and regulations may prove costly.\nIf we or our suppliers fail to comply with ongoing FDA or other foreign regulatory authority requirements, or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, these products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market.\nOnce we obtain certification or marketing authorization for our product candidates, any product for which we obtain certification, clearance or approval, and the manufacturing processes, post-market surveillance, post-certification/approval clinical data and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continued regulatory review, oversight, requirements, and periodic inspections by the FDA and other domestic and foreign regulatory authorities and notified bodies. We must comply with equivalent standards in third countries.\nIn particular, we and our suppliers are required to comply with FDA\u2019s QSR in the U.S. and other regulations enforced outside the United States which cover the manufacture of our products and the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of medical devices. Regulatory authorities, such as the FDA, and notified bodies enforce the QSR in the U.S. and other regulations through periodic inspections. The failure by us or one of our suppliers to comply with applicable statutes and regulations administered by the FDA, or the failure to timely and adequately respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues, could result in, among other things, any of the following enforcement actions:\n\u25cf untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u25cf unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions;\n\u25cf customer notifications for repair, replacement, refunds;\n\u25cf recall, detention or seizure of our products;\n\u25cf operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u25cf refusing or delaying our requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products or modified products;\n\u25cf operating restrictions;\n\u25cf withdrawal of 510(k) clearances on PMA approvals that have already been granted;\n\u25cf refusal to grant export approval for our products; or\n\u25cf criminal prosecution.\nIf any of these actions were to occur it would harm our reputation and cause our product sales and profitability to suffer and may prevent us from generating revenue. Furthermore, our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements which could result in our failure to produce our products on a timely basis and in the required quantities, if at all.\nIn addition, we are required to conduct costly post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or effectiveness of our products, and we must comply with medical device reporting requirements, including the reporting of adverse events and malfunctions related to our products. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, manufacturing problems, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements such as QSR, may result in changes to labeling, restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of the products from the market, voluntary or mandatory recalls, a requirement to repair, replace or refund the cost of any medical device we manufacture or distribute, fines, suspension of certification or regulatory approval, product seizures, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties which would adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nMoreover, we may be required to conduct costly post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or effectiveness of our products in the EEA. We must comply with medical device reporting requirements, including the reporting of adverse events and malfunctions related to our products. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, manufacturing problems, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in changes to labeling, restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of the products from the market, voluntary or mandatory recalls, a requirement to repair, replace or refund the cost of any medical device we manufacture or distribute, fines, suspension of certification, regulatory clearances or approvals, product seizures, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties which would adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nOur products may cause or contribute to adverse medical events or be subject to failures or malfunctions that we are required to report to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and if we fail to do so, we would be subject to sanctions that could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. The discovery of serious safety issues with our products, or a recall of our products either voluntarily or at the direction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, could have a negative impact on us.\nAs a commercial-stage company, we are subject to the FDA\u2019s medical device reporting regulations and similar foreign regulations, which require us to report to the FDA when we receive or become aware of information that reasonably suggests that one or more of our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that, if the malfunction were to recur, it could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. The timing of our obligation to report is triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We may fail to report adverse events of which we become aware within the prescribed timeframe. We may also fail to recognize that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of the product. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the FDA could take action, including warning letters, untitled letters, administrative actions, criminal prosecution, imposition of civil monetary penalties, revocation of our device clearance or approval, seizure of our products or delay in clearance or approval of future products.\nThe FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture of a product or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. The FDA\u2019s authority to require a recall must be based on a finding that there is reasonable probability that the device could cause serious injury or death. We may also choose to voluntarily recall a product if any material deficiency is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, malfunctions, manufacturing defects, labeling or design deficiencies, packaging defects or other deficiencies or failures to comply with applicable regulations. Product defects or other errors may occur in the future.\nDepending on the corrective action we take to redress a product\u2019s deficiencies or defects, the FDA may require, or we may decide, that we will need to obtain new clearances or approvals for the device before we may market or distribute the corrected device. Seeking such clearances or approvals may delay our ability to replace the recalled devices in a timely manner. Moreover, if we do not adequately address problems associated with our devices, we may face additional regulatory enforcement action, including FDA warning letters, product seizure, injunctions, administrative penalties or civil or criminal fines.\nCompanies are required to maintain certain records of recalls and corrections, even if they are not reportable to the FDA. We may initiate voluntary withdrawals or corrections for our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, it could require us to report those actions as recalls and we may be subject to enforcement action. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers, potentially lead to product liability claims against us and negatively affect our sales. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, will require the dedication of our time and capital, will distract management from operating our business and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nAll manufacturers placing medical devices on the market in the EEA are legally bound to report to the relevant competent authorities (a) any serious incident involving devices made available on the EEA market, except expected side-effects which are clearly documented in the product information and quantified in the technical documentation and are subject to trend reporting, and (b) any field safety corrective action in respect of devices made available on the EEA market, including any field safety corrective action undertaken in a third country in relation to a device which is also legally made available on the EEA market, if the reason for the field safety corrective action is not limited to the device made available in the third country. Reports should be submitted through the electronic system set up and managed by the European Commission in collaboration with EEA countries. Report of serious incidents will be automatically transmitted to the competent authority of the EEA country in which the incident occurred and reports on field safety corrections actions will be automatically transmitted to the competent authority of the EEA country in which the field safety corrective action is being or is to be undertaken and the EEA country in which the manufacturer has its registered place of business.\nUnder the EU MDR, a \u201cserious incident\u201d means any incident that directly or indirectly led, might have led or might lead to any of the following: (a) the death of a patient, user or other person; (b) the temporary or permanent serious deterioration of a patient\u2019s, user\u2019s or other person\u2019s state of health; or (c) a serious public health threat. A \u2018field safety corrective action\u2019 means corrective action taken by a manufacturer for technical or medical reasons to prevent or reduce the risk of a serious incident in relation to a device made available on the market.\nMalfunction of our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls, including corrections, or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement actions. If malfunctions do occur, we may be unable to correct the malfunctions adequately or prevent further malfunctions, in which case we may need to cease manufacture and distribution of the affected products, initiate voluntary recalls, and redesign the products. Regulatory authorities may also take actions against us, such as ordering recalls, imposing fines, or seizing the affected products. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nOur approved product or product candidates may in the future be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation, business and financial results.\nMedical devices can experience performance problems in the field that require review and possible corrective action. The occurrence of component failures, manufacturing errors, software errors, design defects or labeling inadequacies affecting a medical device could lead to a government-mandated or voluntary recall by the device manufacturer, in particular when such deficiencies may endanger health. The FDA requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the FDA within 10 working days after the recall is initiated. Comparable foreign regulatory authorities impose similar deadlines. Companies are required to maintain certain records of recalls, even if they are not reportable to the FDA or to comparable foreign regulatory authorities. We may initiate voluntary recalls involving our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, they could require us to report those actions as recalls. Product recalls may divert management attention and financial resources, expose us to product liability or other claims, harm our reputation with customers and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to regulatory or enforcement actions if we engage in improper marketing or promotion of our approved product or product candidates.\nOur educational and promotional activities and training methods must comply with FDA and other applicable laws, including the prohibition of the promotion of a medical device for a use that has not been cleared or approved by the FDA. Use of a device outside of its cleared or approved indications is known as \u201coff-label\u201d use. Physicians may use our products off-label in their professional medical judgment, as the FDA does not restrict or regulate a physician\u2019s choice of treatment within the practice of medicine. However, if the FDA determines that our educational and promotional activities or training constitutes promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of warning letters, untitled letters, fines, penalties, injunctions, or seizures, any of which could have an adverse impact on our reputation and financial results.\nIt is also possible that other federal, state or comparable foreign regulatory authorities might take action if they consider our educational and promotional activities or training methods to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. In that event, our reputation could be damaged, and adoption of the products could be impaired. Although our policy is to refrain from statements that could be considered off-label promotion of our products, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could disagree and conclude that we have engaged in off-label promotion. It is also possible that other federal, state or comparable foreign regulatory authorities might take action, including, but not limited to, through a whistleblower action under the FCA, if they consider our business activities constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties, including, but not limited to, criminal, civil or administrative penalties, treble damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, reporting requirements and compliance oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. In addition, the off-label use of our products may increase the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in substantial damage awards against us, and harm our reputation.\nThe advertising and promotion of our products in the EEA is subject to EEA countries\u2019 national laws implementing Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising, and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, as well as other national legislation of individual EEA country governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. EEA country legislation may also restrict or impose limitations on our ability to advertise our products directly to the general public. In addition, voluntary EU and national Codes of Conduct provide guidelines on the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals.\nWe face extensive, ongoing regulatory requirements and review, and our products may face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nThe holder of an approved PMA or cleared 510(k) also is subject to obligations to monitor and report adverse events and instances of the failure of a product to meet the specifications in the marketing application. Application holders must submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling, or manufacturing process. Legal requirements have also been enacted to require disclosure of clinical trial results on publicly available databases.\nIn addition, manufacturers of FDA regulated products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for compliance with the FDA\u2019s QSR and, as applicable, cGMP regulations. Our relationships with healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors must comply with FDA laws and regulations, the AKS, the FCA, HIPAA, various transparency laws, and similar state and foreign laws. GMPs regulations. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration and to low income patients of certain hospitals, additional laws and requirements apply. Our activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. If we or our third-party collaborators fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory authority may take any of the following actions:\n\u25cf conduct an investigation into our practices and any alleged violation of law;\n\u25cf issue warning letters or untitled letters asserting that we are in violation of the law;\n\u25cf seek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u25cf suspend or withdraw certification or regulatory approval;\n\u25cf require that we suspend or terminate any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u25cf refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us;\n\u25cf suspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements;\n\u25cf seize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or require us to initiate a product recall; or\n\u25cf exclude us from providing our products to those participating in government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and refuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing events or penalties may force us to expend significant amounts of time and money and may significantly inhibit our ability to bring to market or continue to market our products and generate revenue. Similar regulations apply in foreign jurisdictions.\nRisks Related to the Discovery and Development of Our Product Candidates\nWe are heavily dependent on the success of our product candidates, which are in various stages of clinical development. We cannot give any assurance that any of our product candidates, beyond LungFit\u00ae PH, will receive certification or regulatory approval, which is necessary before they can be commercialized.\nTo date, we have invested substantially all of our efforts and financial resources to design and develop our product candidates, including conducting clinical trials and providing general and administrative support for these operations. Our future success is dependent on our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory certification or approval for, and then successfully commercialize one or more product candidates. We currently generate no revenue from sales of any product, and we may never be able to develop or commercialize a marketable product.\nTwo of our product candidates are in the early stages of development and will require additional clinical development (and in some cases additional preclinical development), management of nonclinical, clinical and manufacturing activities, certification or regulatory approval, obtaining adequate manufacturing supply, building of a commercial organization and significant marketing efforts before we generate any revenue from product sales. To date, we have conducted 3 pilot clinical trials involving 198 patients with bronchiolitis (mainly caused by RSV) and a pilot clinical trial in nine patients with CF. In addition, Rambam healthcare campus in Israel conducted a compassionate treatment for two patients with CF who suffer from NTM infections (specifically M. abscessus). All of these trials were conducted outside the U.S. and were not conducted pursuant to an FDA IND. The results of these trials demonstrated improvements in various endpoints and clinical outcomes. The trials were small, however, and it is likely that the FDA will view them as not significant because of their size and scope. In addition, the delivery systems were different from the one that we intend to test and market, subject to FDA approval, in the U.S., further reducing the likelihood that FDA would view these test results as adequate or sufficient to support marketing applications. Two pilot clinical trials are ongoing, one in viral pneumonia and one in NTM lung infection. Both of these studies are using our LungFit\u00ae system (PRO and GO, respectively) and are being conducted outside the United States. Once completed, if the data are favorable, these trials would support our efforts towards obtaining FDA approval. We therefore intend to conduct larger clinical trials aiming for statistically and clinically significant favorable results, or we will not be able to obtain certification or regulatory approval to market such product candidates. It may be years before a pivotal trial is initiated, if at all, for such product candidates. Before a medical device clinical trial can be undertaken in the U.S., the sponsor of the trial must submit an IDE application for a medical device and the FDA must permit the trial to go forward. We cannot assure that we will obtain such agency acquiescence in a timely manner, or at all.\nWe as a company received our first PMA approval of LungFit\u00ae PH from the FDA. We can make no assurances as to what any other comparable foreign regulatory authorities and notified bodies where we are seeking certification or regulatory approval will do. We will expend significant resources to commercialize LungFit\u00ae PH in the U.S. and we can make no assurances that our efforts will be successful. We cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will be successful in clinical trials or receive certification or regulatory approval. Further, our product candidates may not receive certification or regulatory approval even if they are successful in clinical trials. If we do not receive certification or regulatory approvals for our product candidates, we may not be able to continue our operations.\nWe generally plan to seek certification or regulatory approval to commercialize our approved product and product candidates in the U.S., the EU and in additional foreign countries. To obtain certification or regulatory approvals we must comply with the numerous and varying regulatory requirements of such countries regarding safety, efficacy, chemistry, manufacturing and controls, clinical trials, commercial sales, pricing and distribution of our approved product and product candidates. Even if we are successful in obtaining marketing certification or regulatory approval in one jurisdiction, we cannot ensure that we will obtain certification or regulatory approval in any other jurisdictions. If we are unable to obtain certification, clearance or approval for our product candidates in multiple jurisdictions, our revenue and results of operations would be negatively affected.\nSome of our product candidates may be considered a drug/device combination and the process for obtaining regulatory approval in the U.S. will require compliance with complex procedures because concordance between two centers of the FDA (CDRH and CDER) is necessary for approval of this combination product. A change in the FDA\u2019s prior determination that CDRH would lead the review of a marketing application for our product candidates would adversely impact our development timeline and significantly raise our costs to complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approvals.\nThe success of our business may also depend upon our ability to identify, license or discover additional product candidates.\nAlthough a substantial amount of our effort will focus on the continued clinical testing, potential certification, regulatory approval and commercialization of LungFit\u00ae PH and our existing product candidates, the success of our business may also depend upon our ability to identify, license or discover additional product candidates. Our research programs or licensing efforts may fail to yield additional product candidates for clinical development for a number of reasons, including but not limited to the following:\n\u25cf our research or business development methodology or search criteria and process may be unsuccessful in identifying potential product candidates;\n\u25cf we may not be able or willing to assemble sufficient resources to acquire or discover additional product candidates;\n\u25cf our product candidates may not succeed in preclinical or clinical testing;\n\u25cf our potential product candidates may be shown to have harmful side effects or may have other characteristics that may make the product candidates unmarketable or unlikely to receive certification or marketing approval;\n\u25cf competitors may develop alternatives that render our product candidates obsolete or less attractive;\n\u25cf product candidates we develop may be covered by third parties\u2019 patents or other exclusive rights;\n\u25cf the market for a product candidate may change during our program so that such a product may become unreasonable to continue to develop;\n\u25cf a product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all; and\n\u25cf a product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients, the medical community or third-party payors.\nIf any of these events occur, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for a program or programs, or we may not be able to identify, license or discover additional product candidates, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and could potentially cause us to cease operations. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources. We may focus our efforts and resources on potential programs or product candidates that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful.\nThe certification or regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities and notified bodies are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable. If we are ultimately unable to obtain certification or regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed.\nThe time required to obtain certification or regulatory approval by the FDA or notified bodies in the EU is unpredictable, typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors. In addition, certification or regulatory approval policies, regulations or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain certification or regulatory approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions, which may cause delays in the certification or regulatory approval or the decision not to certify or approve an application. We have not obtained certification or regulatory approval for any product other than LungFit\u00ae PH, and it is possible that none of our existing product candidates or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain certification or regulatory approval.\nThe process required by the FDA before a new medical device may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:\n\u25cf completion of or reference to extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA\u2019s Good Laboratory Practice (\u201cGLP\u201d);\n\u25cf performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the medical device candidate for each proposed indication; and\n\u25cf submission to the FDA of a 510(k) or PMA, after completion of all pivotal clinical trials.\nApplications for our product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including but not limited to the following:\n\u25cf the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf we may be unable to demonstrate to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate\u2019s risk-benefit ratio for its proposed indication is acceptable;\n\u25cf the FDA may determine that the population studied in the clinical program was not sufficiently broad or representative to assure safety in the full population for which we seek approval;\n\u25cf the FDA may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of a PMA in the U.S. or elsewhere;\n\u25cf the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes, test procedures and specifications or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies;\n\u25cf the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities and notified bodies may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for certification or approval; and\nThis lengthy certification or regulatory approval process, as well as the unpredictability of the results of clinical trials, may result in our failing to obtain certification or regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates, which would significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nOur business and eventual sale of our approved product and product candidates are subject to extensive regulatory requirements, including compliance with labelling, manufacturing and reporting controls. If we fail or are unable to timely obtain the necessary 510(k) clearances, de-novo authorizations, or PMA, approvals for new products, or equivalent steps in third countries including the EEA, our ability to generate revenue could be materially harmed.\nOur approved product and product candidates are classified as medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the United States by the FDA and other federal, state and local authorities and by comparable foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA can delay, limit or deny 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of a device for many reasons, including:\n\u25cf we may not be able to demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction that our systems are safe and effective for its intended use;\n\u25cf the data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance or approval, where required;\n\u25cf the manufacturing process or facilities we use or contract to use may not meet applicable requirements; and\n\u25cf disruptions at the FDA caused by funding shortages or global health concerns, including the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe FDA may refuse our requests for 510(k) clearance, de-novo or PMA of new products, new intended uses or modifications to existing products.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in the United States that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing any regulatory approval or clearance that we receive in the United States. In addition, the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our test kits under development or impact our ability to modify our currently approved or cleared test kits on a timely basis.\nOur products are also subject to approval, certification and regulation by foreign regulatory and safety agencies. For example, the EU has adopted the EU MDR, which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance. Complying with the requirements of the EU MDR may require us to incur significant expenditures. Failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the EEA and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements.\nOnce commercialized, modifications to our marketed products may require new 510(k) clearances or approval of PMA supplements, or equivalent steps in other countries or regions including the EEA, or may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified products until certification, clearances or regulatory approvals are obtained.\nModifications to any of our products once they are commercialized may require new regulatory approvals or clearances, including 510(k) clearances or approval of PMA supplements, or require us to recall or cease marketing the modified systems until these clearances or approvals are obtained. The FDA requires device manufacturers to initially make and document a determination of whether or not a modification requires a new approval, supplement or clearance. A manufacturer may determine that a modification could not affect safety or efficacy and does not represent a major change in its intended use, so that no new clearance or approval is necessary. However, the FDA can review a manufacturer\u2019s decision and may disagree. The FDA may also on its own initiative determine that a new clearance or approval of a PMA Supplement is required. We may make modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require additional clearances or approvals. If the FDA disagrees and requires new clearances or approvals for the modifications, we may be required to recall and to stop marketing our products as modified, which could require us to redesign our products and/or seek new marketing authorizations and harm our operating results. In these circumstances, we may be subject to significant enforcement actions.\nFor example, if a manufacturer determines that a modification to a PMA approved device could affect its safety or effectiveness or would constitute a major change in its intended use, then the manufacturer must file for a new a new PMA or approval of a PMA supplement. Where we determine that modifications to our products require a new PMA approval, we may not be able to obtain those additional approvals for the modifications or additional indications in a timely manner, or at all. Obtaining new approvals can be a time-consuming process, and delays in obtaining required future approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our future growth.\nFor those products sold in the EEA, we must notify our EU notified body if significant changes are made to the products or if there are substantial changes to our quality assurance systems affecting those products. Obtaining certification can be a time-consuming process, and delays in obtaining required future clearances or approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our future growth.\nMedical device development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies may not be predictive of future study results.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. Product candidates that have shown promising results in early-stage clinical trials may still suffer significant setbacks in subsequent advanced clinical trials. There is a high failure rate for medical devices proceeding through clinical trials, and product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed satisfactorily through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the medical device and biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier studies. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses. We do not know whether any pivotal clinical trials we may conduct will demonstrate consistent or adequate efficacy and safety sufficient to obtain certification or regulatory approval to market our product candidates. Nor do we know whether the FDA will permit us to proceed directly to pivotal trials without performing pilot trials in the U.S. using the same delivery system that we will seek approval by the agency.\nLegislative or regulatory reforms may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain certification, regulatory clearance or approval of any future products and to manufacture, market and distribute our products after certification, clearance or approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory approval, manufacture and marketing of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof. In addition, the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions, which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our future products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently cleared products on a timely basis. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of planned or future products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.\nFDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new statutes, regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of any future products or make it more difficult to obtain clearance or approval for, manufacture, market or distribute our products. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations, statutes, legal interpretation or policies, when and if promulgated, enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future. Such changes could, among other things, require: additional testing prior to obtaining clearance or approval; changes to manufacturing methods; recall, replacement or discontinuance of our products; or additional record keeping.\nThe FDA\u2019s and comparable foreign regulatory authorities\u2019 policies may change and additional government regulations may be promulgated that could prevent, limit or delay certification, regulatory clearance or approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad. For example, the results of the upcoming mid-term Congressional elections may impact our business and industry. Any change in the laws or regulations that govern the clearance and approval processes relating to our current, planned and future products could make it more difficult and costly to obtain clearance or approval for new products or to produce, market and distribute existing products. Significant delays in receiving clearance or approval or the failure to receive clearance or approval for any new products would have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing clearance that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nIn addition, on May 25, 2017, the new EU MDR entered into force for medical devices marketed in the EEA. Implementation of the EU MDR was delayed by one year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following its entry into application on May 26, 2021, the EU MDR introduced substantial changes to the obligations with which medical device manufacturers must comply in the EEA. High risk medical devices are subject to additional scrutiny during the conformity assessment procedure. Specifically, the EU MDR repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EEA countries, the regulations is directly applicable, i.e., without the need for adoption of EEA country laws implementing them, in all EEA countries and are intended to eliminate current differences in regulation of medical devices among EEA countries. The EU MDR, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices to ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. The EU MDR entered into application on May 26, 2021 and among other things:\n\u25cf strengthens the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;\n\u25cf establishes explicit provisions on manufacturers\u2019 responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;\n\u25cf improves the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;\n\u25cf sets up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EEA; and\n\u25cf strengthens rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.\nThe EU MDR imposes a number of new requirements on manufacturers of medical devices. Notified bodies need to be accredited by the EU Member States\u2019 accreditation bodies to conduct assessment procedures for medical devices in accordance with the Regulation. There are currently a relatively small number of notified bodies that have been accredited to conduct these assessments. This may delay conformity assessment procedures in the future in the EEA. This may impact our activities in the EEA and the UK, the renewal of our existing CE Certificates of Conformity and conformity assessment related to future bodies.\nFurther, the EU MDR imposes increased compliance obligations for us to access the EEA market. Our failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, including those administered by authorities of the EEA countries, could result in enforcement actions against us, including refusal, suspension, variation, or withdrawal of our CE Certificates of Conformity by our EU notified body, which could impair our ability to market products in the EEA in the future. Any changes to the membership of the EU, such as the recent departure of the United Kingdom (Brexit), may impact the regulatory requirements for the impacted countries and impair our business operations and our ability to market products in such countries.\nBrexit, has created significant uncertainty concerning the future relationship between the UK and the EU. On 24 December 2020, the EU and UK reached an agreement in principle on the framework for their future relationship, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which took effect on May 1, 2021. The Agreement primarily focuses on ensuring free trade between the EU and the UK in relation to goods. The Agreement does not however, specifically address medical devices. The Agreement seeks to ensure that the parties ensure \u201cregulatory cooperation\u201d. Among the changes that will now occur are that Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) will be treated as a third country. Northern Ireland will, with regard to EU regulations, continue to follow the EU regulatory rules. In light of the fact that the CE marking process is set out in EU law, which no longer applies in the UK, the UK has devised a new route to market culminating in a UK Conformity Assessed (\u201cUKCA\u201d) mark to replace the CE mark. Northern Ireland will, however, continue to be covered by the regulations governing CE marks. As part of the Agreement, the EU and the UK have agreed to continue to recognize declarations of conformity based on a self-assessment in the other territory. Given the lack of comparable precedent to Brexit, it is unclear what the financial, regulatory, and legal implications of Brexit will be and how it will affect us. However, potentially changing regulatory schemes and tariffs engendered by Brexit may add additional complexity, cost and delays in marketing or selling our products in the United Kingdom.\nWe are working on NTM lung infection which is very rare.\nNTM lung infection is a very rare disease and only a small number of people suffer from this condition. As a result of these small numbers, we may not be able to complete the study related to NTM or, even if approved, the device for that indication may never be profitable.\nWe are working on bronchiolitis in infants that usually is caused by the RSV virus.\nRSV is a seasonal virus (only in the winter). In our trial, we are heavily dependent on the occurrence and the severity of this virus. Treating for RSV is highly reliant on the weather conditions in winter. The weather in the winter is not predictable. For example, if the winter is warm or short, or the RSV infection was not severe enough when we conducted our trial, or the length of stay in the hospital at the year that trial was conducted was different from previous seasons, then we might miss the season or the results can be significantly different between two seasons or between different countries or even between different sites.\nClinical trials may be necessary to support future product submissions to the FDA. The clinical trial process is lengthy and expensive with uncertain outcomes, and often requires the enrollment of large numbers of patients, and suitable patients may be difficult to identify and recruit. Delays or failures in our clinical trials will prevent us from commercializing any modified or new products and will adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nInitiating and completing clinical trials necessary to support any future PMAs, and additional safety and efficacy data beyond that typically required for a 510(k) clearance, for our possible future product candidates, will be time-consuming and expensive and the outcome uncertain. Moreover, the results of early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, and any product we advance into clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our products conducted to date and ongoing or future studies and trials of our current, planned or future products may not be predictive of the results of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Our interpretation of data and results from our clinical trials do not ensure that we will achieve similar results in future clinical trials. In addition, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to various interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their products performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and earlier clinical trials have nonetheless failed to replicate results in later clinical trials. Products in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through nonclinical studies and earlier clinical trials. Failure can occur at any stage of clinical testing. Our clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical and non-clinical testing in addition to those we have planned.\nThe initiation and completion of any of clinical trials may be prevented, delayed, or halted for numerous reasons. We may experience delays in our ongoing clinical trials for a number of reasons, which could adversely affect the costs, timing or successful completion of our clinical trials, including related to the following:\n\u25cf we may be required to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing certain human clinical trials of medical devices, and the FDA may reject our IDE application and notify us that we may not begin clinical trials;\n\u25cf regulators and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree as to the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf regulators and/or an IRB, or other reviewing bodies may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial, or to conduct or continue a clinical trial at a prospective or specific trial site;\n\u25cf we may not reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u25cf clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u25cf the number of subjects or patients required for clinical trials may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be insufficient or slower than we anticipate, and the number of clinical trials being conducted at any given time may be high and result in fewer available patients for any given clinical trial, or patients may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u25cf our third-party contractors, including those manufacturing products or conducting clinical trials on our behalf, may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u25cf we might have to suspend or terminate clinical trials for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u25cf we may have to amend clinical trial protocols or conduct additional studies to reflect changes in regulatory requirements or guidance, which we may be required to submit to an IRB and/or regulatory authorities for re-examination;\n\u25cf regulators, IRBs, or other parties may require or recommend that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including safety signals or noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf the cost of clinical trials may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u25cf clinical sites may not adhere to the clinical protocol or may drop out of a clinical trial;\n\u25cf we may be unable to recruit a sufficient number of clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf regulators, IRBs, or other reviewing bodies may fail to approve or subsequently find fault with our manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we enter into agreement for clinical and commercial supplies, the supply of devices or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials may be insufficient, inadequate or not available at an acceptable cost, or we may experience interruptions in supply;\n\u25cf approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for certification or approval;\n\u25cf our current or future products may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics; and\n\u25cf impacts of regional or global public health crises including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect any clinical trials we are conducting or plan to conduct, including delays or difficulties in enrolling or onboarding patients, initiating clinical sites, or obtaining the requisite certification or regulatory approvals, interruption of key clinical trial activities, or supply chain disruptions that delay or make it more difficult or costly to obtain the supplies and materials we need for clinical trials.\nAny of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of certification or regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nClinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the laws and regulations of the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities\u2019 legal requirements, regulations or guidelines, and are subject to oversight by these governmental authorities and IRBs at the medical institutions where the clinical trials are conducted. Conducting successful clinical trials will require the enrollment of large numbers of patients, and suitable patients may be difficult to identify and recruit. Patient enrollment in clinical trials and completion of patient participation and follow-up depends on many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the attractiveness of, or the discomforts and risks associated with, the treatments received by enrolled subjects, the availability of appropriate clinical trial investigators, support staff, and proximity of patients to clinical sites and able to comply with the eligibility and exclusion criteria for participation in the clinical trial and patient compliance. For example, patients may be discouraged from enrolling in our clinical trials if the trial protocol requires them to undergo extensive post-treatment procedures or follow-up to assess the safety and effectiveness of our products or if they determine that the treatments received under the trial protocols are not attractive or involve unacceptable risks or discomforts.\nWe depend on our collaborators and on medical institutions and CROs to conduct our clinical trials in compliance with GCP requirements. To the extent our collaborators or the CROs fail to enroll participants for our clinical trials, fail to conduct the study to GCP standards or are delayed for a significant time in the execution of trials, including achieving full enrollment, we may be affected by increased costs, program delays or both. In addition, clinical trials that are conducted in countries outside the United States may subject us to further delays and expenses as a result of increased shipment costs, additional regulatory requirements and the engagement of non-U.S. CROs, as well as expose us to risks associated with clinical investigators who are unknown to the FDA, and different standards of diagnosis, screening and medical care.\nDevelopment of sufficient and appropriate clinical protocols to demonstrate safety and efficacy are required and we may not adequately develop such protocols to support clearance and approval. Further, the FDA may require us to submit data on a greater number of patients than we originally anticipated and/or for a longer follow-up period or change the data collection requirements or data analysis applicable to our clinical trials. Delays in patient enrollment or failure of patients to continue to participate in a clinical trial may cause an increase in costs and delays in the approval and attempted commercialization of our products or result in the failure of the clinical trial. In addition, despite considerable time and expense invested in our clinical trials, the FDA may not consider our data adequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Such increased costs and delays or failures could adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nEven if our products are approved or cleared in the United States and CE marked in the EEA, comparable regulatory authorities of additional foreign countries must also approve the manufacturing and marketing of our products in those countries. Certification, approval and clearance procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the United States or the EEA, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nIn the EEA, we consider that our products would be classified as a medical device. However, competent regulatory authorities in EEA countries or notified bodies could disagree and consider our products to be a drug-delivery combination product composed of a medical device and a medicinal product. In the EEA, a drug-delivery systems can fall within the scope of the medical device legislation or the pharmaceutical legislation depending on their combination with the relevant medicinal substance.\nIf our device is considered as being intended to administer a medicinal product and our device and the medicinal product are placed on the market in such a way that they form a single integral product which is intended exclusively for use in the given combination and which is not reusable, that single integral product shall be governed by Directive 2001/83/EC and be subject to a marketing authorization. The medical device part of the drug-delivery combination product would not need to be CE marked. However, the relevant general safety and performance requirements set out in Annex I to the EU MDR would apply as far as the safety and performance of the device part of the single integral product are concerned. As a result, we would need to pursue different regulatory pathways for placing our product on the EEA market which may lead to additional costs and time.\nWe may find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical trials. Difficulty in enrolling patients could delay or prevent clinical trials of our product candidates.\nIdentifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates is critical to our success. The timing of our clinical trials depends in part on the speed at which we can recruit patients to participate in testing our product candidates, and we may experience delays in our clinical trials if we encounter difficulties in enrollment.\nSome of the conditions for which we plan to evaluate our current product candidates are for rare diseases. For example, we estimate that 15,000 patients suffer from refractory NTM lung infection in the U.S. Accordingly, there is a limited patient pool from which to draw for clinical trials. Further, the eligibility criteria of our clinical trials will further limit the pool of available study participants as we will require that patients have specific characteristics that we can measure or to assure their disease is either severe enough or not too advanced to include them in a study.\nAdditionally, the process of finding patients may prove costly. We also may not be able to identify, recruit and enroll a sufficient number of patients to complete our clinical trials because of the perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study, particularly the toxicity of NO in certain doses, the availability and efficacy of competing therapies and clinical trials, the proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients and the patient referral practices of physicians. If patients are unwilling to participate in our studies for any reason, the timeline for recruiting patients, conducting studies and obtaining certification or regulatory approval of potential products will be delayed.\nIf we experience delays in the completion or termination of any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenue from any of these product candidates could be delayed or prevented. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and certification or approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of certification or regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nWe may encounter substantial delays in our clinical trials, or we may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.\nBefore obtaining certification or marketing approval from regulatory authorities and notified bodies for the sale of our product candidates, we must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, time consuming and uncertain as to outcome. We cannot guarantee that any clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. Our clinical trials involve infants, children, and adults and, before we are permitted to enroll them in clinical trials, we must demonstrate that although the research may pose a risk to the subjects, there is a prospect of direct benefit to each patient. We must do so to the satisfaction of each research site\u2019s IRB. If we fail to adequately demonstrate this to the satisfaction of the relevant IRB, it will decline to approve the research, which could have significant adverse consequences for us.\nA failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing, and our future clinical trials may not be successful. Events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include but are not limited to:\n\u25cf inability to generate sufficient preclinical, toxicology or other in vivo or in vitro data to support the initiation of human clinical trials;\n\u25cf delays in reaching a consensus with regulatory authorities on study design;\n\u25cf delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf delays in obtaining required IRB approval at each clinical trial site;\n\u25cf imposition of a clinical hold by regulatory authorities, after review of an IDE application, or equivalent application, or an inspection of our clinical trial operations or study sites;\n\u25cf delays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in our clinical trials;\n\u25cf difficulty collaborating with patient groups and investigators;\n\u25cf failure by our CROs, other third parties or us to adhere to clinical trial requirements;\n\u25cf failure to perform in accordance with the FDA\u2019s GPC requirements, or applicable regulatory guidelines in other foreign countries;\n\u25cf delays in having patients complete participation in a study or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u25cf occurrence of serious adverse events associated with the product candidate that are viewed to outweigh its potential benefits;\n\u25cf changes in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols;\n\u25cf the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates being greater than we anticipate;\n\u25cf clinical trials of our product candidates producing negative or inconclusive results, which may result in us deciding, or regulators requiring us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs; and\n\u25cf delays in manufacturing, testing, releasing, validating or importing/exporting sufficient stable quantities of our product candidates for use in clinical trials or the inability to do any of the foregoing.\nAny inability to successfully complete preclinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenue. We may also be required to conduct additional safety, efficacy and comparability studies before we will be allowed to start clinical trials. Clinical trial delays could also shorten any periods during which our products have patent protection and may allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their certification or regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive marketing label or the delay or denial of certification or regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities. There is currently limited data regarding possible side effects for an antimicrobial dosage of NO treatments, such as our product candidates. Potential side effects of NO treatments may include high MetHb, NO2 toxicity, nose bleeding and low blood pressure. Results of our studies may identify unacceptable severity and prevalence of these or other side effects. In such an event, our studies could be suspended or terminated, and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities or notified bodies could order us to cease further development of or deny certification or approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications.\nNO-related side effects could affect patient recruitment, the ability of enrolled patients to complete the study or result in potential product liability claims.\nAdditionally, if our product candidates receive certification or marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf regulatory authorities and notified bodies may withdraw certification or approvals of such product;\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label;\n\u25cf we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u25cf our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials and perform other tasks for us. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or comply with regulatory requirements, we may not be able to obtain certification or regulatory approval for or commercialize our approved product or product candidates and our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon third-party CROs to monitor and manage data for our ongoing preclinical and clinical programs. We rely on these parties for execution of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and we directly control only certain aspects of their activities, although from a regulatory perspective we are responsible for their actions. We are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs and other vendors are required to comply with GCP, QSR and GLP, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the competent authorities of the EEA countries, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these regulations through periodic inspections of study sponsors, principal investigators, study sites and other contractors. If we or any of our CROs or vendors fail to comply with applicable regulations, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with products that are produced under QSR regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the certification or regulatory approval process, or have other adverse consequences.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or do so on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, our CROs are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs, we cannot control whether they devote sufficient time and resources to our on-going clinical, nonclinical and preclinical programs. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain certification or regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our approved product or product candidates. CROs may also generate higher costs than anticipated. As a consequence, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our approved product or product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.\nSwitching or adding additional CROs involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays may occur, which could materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture our NO generator and delivery system. Our business could be harmed if those third parties fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of our needed supplies, or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices.\nWe do not currently have the infrastructure or capability internally to manufacture the components of our NO generator and delivery system, and we lack the resources and the capability to manufacture our approved product or any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. We plan to rely on third parties for such supplies. There are a limited number of manufacturers who have the ability to produce our delivery system, and there may be a need to identify alternate manufacturers to prevent a possible disruption of our clinical trials. Any significant delay or discontinuity in the supply of these components could considerably delay commercialization of our approved product, completion of our clinical trials, product testing and potential certification or regulatory approval of our product candidates, which could harm our business and results of operations.\nWe and our collaborators and contract manufacturers are subject to significant regulation with respect to manufacturing our approved product or product candidates. The manufacturing facilities on which we rely may not continue to meet regulatory requirements and have limited capacity.\nAll entities involved in the preparation of medical devices for clinical trials or commercial sale, including our existing contract manufacturers for our approved product and product candidates, are subject to extensive regulation. Components of a finished medical device product approved for commercial sale or used in late-stage clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with QSR in the U.S., and similar requirements in foreign countries. These regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures (including record keeping) and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of investigational products and products approved for sale. Poor control of production processes can lead to the introduction of contaminants or to inadvertent changes in the properties or stability of our approved product or product candidates that may not be detectable in final product testing. We, our collaborators or our contract manufacturers must supply all necessary documentation in support of any marketing application on a timely basis and must adhere to GLP and QSR regulations enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities through their facilities inspection program. The facilities and quality systems of some or all of our collaborators and third-party contractors must pass a pre-approval inspection for compliance with the applicable regulations as a condition of certification or regulatory approval of our product candidates or any of our other potential products. In addition, the regulatory authorities may, at any time, audit or inspect a manufacturing facility involved with the preparation of our approved product, product candidates or our other potential products or the associated quality systems for compliance with the regulations applicable to the activities being conducted. We do not control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with the regulatory requirements. If these facilities do not pass a pre-approval plant inspection, certification or regulatory approval of the products may not be granted or may be substantially delayed until any violations are corrected to the satisfaction of the regulatory authority, if ever.\nThe regulatory authorities also may, at any time following certification or approval of a product for sale, audit the manufacturing facilities of our collaborators and third-party contractors. If any such inspection or audit identifies a failure to comply with applicable regulations or if a violation of our product specifications or applicable regulations occurs independent of such an inspection or audit, we or the relevant regulatory authority may require remedial measures that may be costly and/or time consuming for us or a third party to implement, and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical trial or commercial sales, or the temporary or permanent closure of a facility. Any such remedial measures imposed upon us or third parties with whom we contract could materially harm our business. If we, our collaborators, or any of our third-party manufacturers fail to maintain regulatory compliance, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities can impose regulatory sanctions including, among other things, refuse to approve a pending application for a new drug product, withdrawal of a certification or approval, suspend production, suspend clinical trials, require a recall or suspension of production. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nAdditionally, if supply from one approved manufacturer is interrupted, an alternative manufacturer would need to be qualified through a PMA Supplement or Marketing Authorization Application amendment, or equivalent foreign regulatory filing, which could result in further delays. The regulatory authorities may also require additional studies if a new manufacturer is relied upon for commercial production. Switching manufacturers may involve substantial costs and is likely to result in a delay in our desired clinical and commercial timelines.\nThese factors could cause us to incur higher costs and could cause the delay or termination of clinical trials, regulatory submissions, required certification or approvals or commercialization of our approved product or product candidates. Furthermore, if our suppliers fail to meet contractual requirements and we are unable to secure one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, our clinical trials may be delayed or we could lose potential revenue.\nIf we encounter issues with our contract manufacturers or suppliers, we may need to qualify alternative manufacturers or suppliers, which could impair our ability to sufficiently and timely manufacture and supply LungFit\u00ae PH.\nWe currently depend on contract manufacturers and suppliers for LungFit\u00ae PH and its components. Although we could obtain each of these components from other third-party suppliers, we would need to qualify and obtain FDA approval for another contract manufacturer or supplier as an alternative source for each such component, which could be costly and cause significant delays. Each of our current commercial manufacturing and supply agreements include limitations on our ability to utilize alternative manufacturers or suppliers for these components above certain specified thresholds during the terms of the agreements, which impairs our ability to fully implement any future manufacturing strategies to prevent supply shortages or quality issues.\nIn addition, some of our suppliers and contract manufacturers, including Spartronics and Medisize, conduct their manufacturing operations for us at a single facility. Unless and until we qualify additional facilities, we may face limitations in our ability to respond to manufacturing and supply issues. For example, if regulatory, manufacturing or other problems require one of these manufacturers or suppliers to discontinue production at their respective facility, or if the equipment used for the production of LungFit\u00ae PH in these facilities is significantly damaged or destroyed by fire, flood, earthquake, power loss or similar events, the ability of such manufacturer or supplier to provide components needed for LungFit\u00ae PH, or to manufacture LungFit\u00ae PH may be significantly impaired. In the event that these parties suffer a temporary or protracted loss of its facility or equipment, we would still be required to obtain FDA approval to qualify a new manufacturer or supplier, as applicable, as an alternate manufacturer or source for the respective component before any components manufactured by such manufacturer or by such supplier could be sold or used.\nAny production shortfall that impairs the supply of LungFit\u00ae PH or any of these components could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for LungFit\u00ae PH, which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results materially.\nWe depend on third-party manufacturers, including sole source suppliers, to manufacture LungFit\u00ae PH and our product candidates and the materials we require for our clinical trials. We may not be able to maintain these relationships and could experience supply disruptions outside of our control.\nWe rely on a network of third-party manufacturers to manufacture and supply LungFit\u00ae PH for commercial sale and post-certification/approval clinical trials, and our drug candidates for clinical trials and any commercial sales if they are approved. As a result of our reliance on these third-party manufacturers and suppliers, including sole source suppliers of certain components of LungFit\u00ae PH and our product candidates, we could be subject to significant supply disruptions. Our supply chain for sourcing raw materials and manufacturing drug product ready for distribution is a multi-step endeavor. Third-party contract manufacturers supply us with raw materials, and contract manufacturers in the United States convert these raw materials into drug substance and convert the drug substance into final dosage form. Establishing and managing this supply chain requires a significant financial commitment and the creation and maintenance of numerous third-party contractual relationships. Although we attempt to effectively manage the business relationships with companies in our supply chain, we do not have control over their operations.\nWe require a supply of LungFit\u00ae PH for sale in the United States, and we will require a supply of LungFit\u00ae PH for sale in international markets if we obtain certification or marketing approvals outside of the United States. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on sole source third-party manufacturers to produce starting materials, drug substance, and final drug product, and to package and label LungFit\u00ae PH and our product candidates. While we have identified and expect to qualify and engage back-up third party manufacturers as additional or alternative suppliers for the commercial supply of LungFit\u00ae PH, we currently do not have such arrangements in place. Moreover, some of these alternative manufacturers will have to be approved by the FDA before we can use them for manufacturing LungFit\u00ae PH. It is also possible that supplies of materials that cannot be second-sourced can be managed with inventory planning. There can be no assurance, however, that failure of any of our original sole source third party manufacturers to meet our commercial demands for LungFit\u00ae PH in a timely manner, or our failure to engage qualified additional or back-up suppliers for the commercial supply of LungFit\u00ae PH, would not have a material adverse effect on commercialization of LungFit\u00ae and our business.\nSupply disruptions may result from a number of factors, including shortages in product raw materials, labor or technical difficulties, regulatory inspections or restrictions, shipping or customs delays or any other performance failure by any third-party manufacturer on which we rely. Any supply disruptions could disrupt sales of LungFit\u00ae PH and/or the timing of our clinical trials, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Furthermore, we may be required to modify our production methods to permit us to economically manufacture our drugs for sale and our drug candidates for clinical trials. These modifications may require us to re-evaluate our resources and the resources of our third-party manufacturers, which could result in abrupt changes in our production methods and supplies.\nIn the course of providing its services, a contract manufacturer may develop process technology related to the manufacture of our products or drug candidates that the manufacturer owns, either independently or jointly with us. This would increase our reliance on that manufacturer or require us to obtain a license from that manufacturer in order to have LungFit\u00ae PH or our drug candidates manufactured by other suppliers utilizing the same process.\nThe failure of our third party manufacturers to meet our commercial demands for LungFit\u00ae PH in a timely manner, or our failure to engage qualified additional or back-up suppliers for the commercial supply of LungFit\u00ae PH, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nOur reliance on third parties requires us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed.\nBecause we rely on third parties to develop and manufacture LungFit\u00ae PH and our product candidates, we must, at times, share trade secrets with them. We seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, collaborative research agreements, consulting agreements or other similar agreements with our collaborators, advisors, employees and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, such as trade secrets. Despite the contractual provisions employed when working with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how and trade secrets, a competitor\u2019s discovery of our trade secrets or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain effective patent rights for LungFit\u00ae PH, our product candidates or any future product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our technologies, approved product and product candidates. Our success depends in large part on our and our licensors\u2019 ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection in the U.S. and in other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products.\nWe have sought to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the U.S. and abroad related to our novel technologies and products that are important to our business. This process is expensive and time consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. We may also fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection.\nThe patent position of medical device, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions for which legal principles remain unsolved. The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover our approved product or product candidates in the U.S. or in other foreign countries. There is no assurance that all potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found, which can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application. Even if patents do successfully issue, and even if such patents cover our approved product or product candidates, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability or scope, which may result in such patents being narrowed, found unenforceable or invalidated. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property, provide exclusivity for our approved product or product candidates or prevent others from designing around our claims. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe have filed several patent applications directed to various aspects of our approved product and product candidates. We cannot offer any assurances about which, if any, patents will issue, the breadth of any such patent or whether any issued patents will be found invalid and unenforceable or will be threatened by third parties. Any successful opposition to these patents or any other patents owned by or licensed to us after patent issuance could deprive us of rights necessary for the successful commercialization of our approved product or any product candidates that we may develop. Further, if we encounter delays in certification or regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market a product candidate under patent protection could be reduced. In addition, some or all of our patent applications may not result in issued patents.\nIf we cannot obtain and maintain effective patent rights for our approved product or product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business and results of operations would be harmed.\nIntellectual property rights of third parties could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our approved product or product candidates, and we might be required to litigate or obtain licenses from third parties in order to develop or market our approved product or product candidates. Such litigation or licenses could be costly or not available on commercially reasonable terms.\nGiven the number of companies developing various types of NO devices, it is difficult to conclusively assess our freedom to operate without infringing on third party rights. There are numerous companies that have pending patent applications and issued patents in the field of therapeutic NO delivery. Our competitive position may suffer if patents issued to third parties or other third-party intellectual property rights cover our products or elements thereof, or our manufacture or uses relevant to our development plans. In such cases, we may not be in a position to develop or commercialize our approved product or product candidates unless we successfully pursue litigation to nullify or invalidate the third-party intellectual property right concerned, or enter into a license agreement with the intellectual property right holder, if available on commercially reasonable terms. There may be pending patent applications of which we are not aware, that if they result in issued patents, could be alleged to be infringed by our approved product or product candidates. If such an infringement claim should be brought and be successful, we may be required to pay substantial damages, be forced to abandon our approved product or product candidates or seek a license from any patent holders. No assurances can be given that a license will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nIt is also possible that we have failed to identify relevant third-party patents or applications. Patent applications in the U.S. and elsewhere are published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing for which priority is claimed, with such earliest filing date being commonly referred to as the priority date. Therefore, patent applications covering our approved product, product candidates or platform technology could have been filed by others without our knowledge. Additionally, pending patent applications which have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our platform technologies, our approved product or product candidates or the use of our approved product or product candidates. Third-party intellectual property right holders may also actively bring infringement claims against us. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully settle or otherwise resolve such infringement claims. If we are unable to successfully settle future claims on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to engage in or continue costly, unpredictable and time-consuming litigation and may be prevented from or experience substantial delays in pursuing the development of and/or marketing our approved product or product candidate. If we fail in any such dispute, in addition to being forced to pay damages, we may be temporarily or permanently prohibited from commercializing our approved product or product candidate that is held to be infringing. We might, if possible, also be forced to redesign our approved product or product candidate so that we no longer infringe the third-party intellectual property rights. Any of these events, even if we were ultimately to prevail, could require us to divert substantial financial and management resources that we would otherwise be able to devote to our business.\nPatent terms are limited and we may not be able to effectively protect our products and business.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the U.S., the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed. Although various extensions may be available, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited.\nIn addition, upon issuance in the U.S., the patent term may be extended based on certain delays caused by the applicant(s) or the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d). Even if we obtain effective patent rights for our approved product or product candidates, we may not have sufficient patent terms or regulatory exclusivity to protect our products, and our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nPatent policy and rule changes could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nChanges in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the U.S. and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. We therefore cannot be certain that we or our licensor were the first to make the invention claimed in our owned and licensed patents or pending applications, or that we or our licensor were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. Assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, in the U.S. prior to March 15, 2013, the first to invent the claimed invention is entitled to the patent, while outside the U.S., the first to file a patent application is entitled to the patent. After March 15, 2013, under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (\u201cLeahy-Smith Act\u201d), enacted on September 16, 2011, the U.S. has moved to a first to file system. The Leahy-Smith Act also includes a number of significant changes that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The effects of these changes are currently unclear as the USPTO must still implement various regulations, the courts have yet to address these provisions and the applicability of the act and new regulations on specific patents discussed herein have not been determined and would need to be reviewed. In general, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective proprietary rights for our approved product, product candidates or any future product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable or that we elect not to patent, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our product candidate discovery and development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.\nAll of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology enter into confidentiality agreements and we expect they will assign all rights in their inventions to us pursuant to the terms of such agreements; however, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed or that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets could impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating the trade secret.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There have been many lawsuits and other proceedings involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including with respect to NO delivery systems and formulations, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions and reexamination proceedings before the USPTO and corresponding foreign patent offices. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our approved product or product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties.\nThird parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our approved product or product candidates. We do not know whether there are any third-party patents that would impair our ability to commercialize our approved product or such product candidates. We also cannot be sure that we have identified each and every patent and pending patent application in the U.S. and abroad that is relevant or necessary to the commercialization of our approved product and product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents that our approved product or product candidates may infringe. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of our approved product or any of our product candidates, any molecules formed during the manufacturing process or any final product itself, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize our approved product or such product candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire or are finally determined to be invalid or unenforceable.\nSimilarly, if any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations, processes for manufacture or methods of use, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize our approved product or the applicable product candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires or is finally determined to be invalid or unenforceable. In either case, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nParties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize our approved product or one or more of our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining necessary rights to our approved product or product candidates through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nWe currently own and have in-licensed rights to intellectual property through licenses from third parties and under patents that we own, to develop our approved product and product candidates. Because our programs may require the use of proprietary rights held by third parties, the growth of our business will likely depend in part on our ability to acquire, in-license or use these proprietary rights. In addition, our approved product or product candidates may require specific formulations to work effectively and efficiently and the rights to these formulations may be held by others. We may be unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, processes or other third-party intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify as necessary for our approved product or product candidates. The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities.\nFor example, we sometimes collaborate with U.S. and foreign academic institutions to accelerate our preclinical research or development underwritten agreements with these institutions. Typically, these institutions provide us with an option to negotiate a license to any of the institution\u2019s rights in technology resulting from the collaboration. Regardless of such option, we may be unable to negotiate a license within the specified timeframe or under terms that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to do so, the institution may offer the intellectual property rights to other parties, potentially blocking our ability to pursue our program.\nIn addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property rights, we may have to abandon development of that program and our business and financial condition could suffer.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license intellectual property and other rights from third parties or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe are currently a party to intellectual property license agreements that are important to our business, and we may enter into additional license agreements in the future. Our existing license agreements impose, and we expect that future license agreements will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty and other obligations on us.\nLicensing of intellectual property is of critical importance to our business and involves complex legal, business and scientific issues. Disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u25cf the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n\u25cf the sublicensing of patent and other rights;\n\u25cf our diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n\u25cf the ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our collaborators; and\n\u25cf the priority of invention of patented technology.\nIf disputes over intellectual property and other rights that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected approved product or product candidates.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits or post-grant proceedings to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensor, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe the patents of our licensor. If our licensing partner were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidate is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the U.S., defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable.\nPending patent applications may be subject to third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the USPTO, and any patents issuing thereon may become involved in derivation, reexamination, inter parties review, post grant review, interference proceedings or other patent office proceedings in the U.S. challenging our patent rights.\nProceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us or declared by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensor. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our defense of litigation or proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our research programs, license necessary technology from third parties or enter into development partnerships that would help us bring our approved product and product candidates to market.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties or that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and independent contractors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any of our employee\u2019s former employer or other third parties. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, which could adversely impact our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship of our patents and other intellectual property.\nWe may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in or right to compensation with respect to our patents or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. For example, we may have inventorship disputes arise from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our approved product or product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or claiming the right to compensation. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees. To the extent that our employees have not effectively waived the right to compensation with respect to inventions that they helped create, they may be able to assert claims for compensation with respect to our future revenue may be successful. As a result, we may receive less revenue from future products if such claims are successful which in turn could impact our future profitability.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nAs is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biotechnology industry involves both technological and legal complexity. Therefore, obtaining and enforcing biotechnology patents is costly, time consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the U.S. has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our approved product or product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the U.S. can be less extensive than those in the U.S. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the U.S.\nCompetitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may also export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the U.S. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nWe manage our business through a small number of employees and key consultants.\nAs of March 31, 2022, we had a total of 62 full-time employees and a number of dedicated consultants, of whom work for us on a part-time basis. In addition, any of our employees and consultants may leave our company at any time, subject to certain notice periods. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or any key employees or consultants would adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results.\nWe do not currently carry \u201ckey person\u201d insurance on the lives of members of management.\nWe will need to expand our organization and we may experience difficulties in recruiting needed additional employees and consultants, which could disrupt our operations.\nAs our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, we will need additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial, legal and other resources. The competition for qualified personnel in the life sciences field is intense. Due to this intense competition, we may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to recruit suitable replacement personnel. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in higher employee costs, increased attrition and significant shifts in the labor market and employee expectations. We may experience difficulty retaining and motivating existing employees and attracting qualified personnel to fill key positions. In addition, labor shortages and employee mobility may make it more difficult to hire and retain employees.\nOur management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of additional product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate and/or grow revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our approved product and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth.\nInternational expansion of our business exposes us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the U.S., the EEA or Israel.\nOther than our operations that are located in the EEA and Israel (as further described below), we currently have limited international operations, but our business strategy incorporates potentially significant international expansion, particularly in anticipation of certification or regulatory approval of our product candidates. We plan to maintain non-commercial infrastructure and conduct physician and patient association outreach activities, as well as clinical trials, outside of the U.S., the EEA and Israel. Doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf multiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as privacy regulations, tax laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, regulatory requirements and other governmental certification, approvals, permits and licenses;\n\u25cf failure by us to obtain certification or regulatory approvals for the use of our products in various countries;\n\u25cf additional potentially relevant third-party patent rights;\n\u25cf complexities and difficulties in obtaining protection and enforcing our intellectual property;\n\u25cf difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf complexities associated with managing multiple payor reimbursement regimes, government payors or patient self-pay systems;\n\u25cf limits on our ability to penetrate international markets;\n\u25cf financial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable, the impact of local and regional financial crises on demand and payment for our products and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u25cf natural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism and political unrest, outbreak of disease, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions;\n\u25cf certain expenses including, among others, expenses for travel, translation and insurance; and\n\u25cf regulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over sales and activities that may fall within the purview of the FCPA, its books and records provisions or its anti-bribery provisions.\nAny of these factors could significantly harm our future international expansion and operations and, consequently, our results of operations.\nThe use of any of our products could result in product liability or similar claims that could be expensive, damage our reputation and harm our business.\nOur business exposes us to an inherent risk of potential product liability or similar claims. The medical device industry has historically been litigious, and we face financial exposure to product liability or similar claims if the use of any of our products were to cause or contribute to injury or death. There is also the possibility that defects in the design or manufacture of any of our products might necessitate a product recall. Although we plan to maintain product liability insurance, the coverage limits of these policies may not be adequate to cover future claims. In the future, we may be unable to maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms or at reasonable costs and such insurance may not provide us with adequate coverage against potential liabilities. A product liability claim, regardless of merit or ultimate outcome, or any product recall could result in substantial costs to us, damage to our reputation, customer dissatisfaction and frustration and a substantial diversion of management attention. A successful claim brought against us in excess of, or outside of, our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face business disruption and related risks resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, which could have a material adverse effect on our business plan.\nThe development of our product candidates or commercialization of our approved product could be further disrupted and adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The spread of COVID-19 resulted in the Director General of the World Health Organization declaring COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The Company has assessed the impact COVID-19 may have on our business plans and its ability to conduct the preclinical studies and clinical trials as well as on our reliance on third-party manufacturing and our supply chain. The Company experienced significant delays in the supply chain for LungFit\u00ae PH due to the redundancy in parts and suppliers for ventilator manufacturing, which has since been remedied. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to further avoid part or all of any impact from COVID-19 or its consequences. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and global efforts to contain its spread may impact our operations will depend on future developments.\nWe are dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including from cybersecurity breaches and data leakage.\nWe rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems to operate our businesses, some of which are managed, hosted provided and/or used for third-parties or their vendors. We collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information (including personal information and pseudonymized information), and we deploy and operate an array of technical and procedural controls to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. A significant breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction, interruption, or unavailability of critical information technology systems or infrastructure, by our workforce, others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations. Hardware, software, or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other supply chain problems that could unexpectedly compromise our information and network security.\nThe ever-increasing use and evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing, creates opportunities for the unintentional dissemination or intentional destruction of confidential information stored in our or our third-party providers\u2019 systems, portable media or storage devices. We could also experience a business interruption, theft of confidential information or reputational damage from industrial espionage attacks, malware or other cyber-attacks (including ransomware), which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers. While we have invested in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches. Any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. In addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of our Common Stock\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for (A) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us; (B) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders; (C) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or our Bylaws; or (D) any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. In addition, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or any other claim for which the federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction.\nThe choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nRecent trading in our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future.\nThe stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. The market prices of the securities of biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies, particularly companies like ours without product revenues and earnings, have been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future. This volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.\nThe following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:\n\u25cf announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf announcement of FDA approval, disapproval or delay of approval of our product candidates or other product-related actions;\n\u25cf developments involving our discovery efforts and clinical trials;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights, including announcements of infringement, interference or other litigation against us or our potential licensees;\n\u25cf developments involving our efforts to commercialize our products, including developments impacting the timing of commercialization;\n\u25cf announcements concerning our competitors, or the biotechnology, pharmaceutical or drug delivery industry in general;\n\u25cf public concerns as to the safety or efficacy of our approved product or product candidates or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u25cf changes in government regulation of the pharmaceutical or medical industry;\n\u25cf changes in the reimbursement policies of third party insurance companies or government agencies;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf developments involving corporate collaborators, if any;\n\u25cf changes in accounting principles; and\n\u25cf the loss of any of our key scientific or management personnel. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies that experience volatility in the market price of their securities. Whether or not meritorious, litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe cannot assure you that our common stock price and volume will remain at current levels in which case investors may sustain large losses.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the stocks of small-cap biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The realization of any of the above risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in these \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nAntidilution provisions in certain of our outstanding warrants may affect the interests of our common stockholders.\nOn March 16, 2018, Empery Asset Master, Ltd., Empery Tax Efficient, LP and Empery Tax Efficient II, LP, (collectively, \u201cEmpery\u201d) filed a complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York (the \u201cTrial Court\u201d) against us relating to the notice of adjustment of both the exercise price of and the number of warrant shares issuable under warrants issued to Empery in January 2017. Empery alleges that, as a result of certain circumstances in connection with a February 2018 financing transaction, the 166,672 warrants issued to Empery in January 2017 provide for adjustments to both the exercise price of the warrants and the number of warrant shares issuable upon such exercise.\nOn August 20, 2020, the Trial Court denied our summary judgment motion as to the first and third claims for relief, but dismissed the second claim for declaratory judgment as moot (the \u201cAugust 20 Decision\u201d). The Appellate Division First Department denied our appeal of the August 20 Decision on September 30, 2021. Following a three-day bench trial, the Trial Court issued a decision on October 14, 2021, finding in favor of Empery on the two remaining claims, granting reformation of the Warrant Agreement, and awarding Empery damages in the aggregate amount of approximately $5.8 million. On November 12, 2021, we filed a notice of appeal. Pending appeal, we are required to use approximately $7.4 million of cash as collateral to secure a supersedeas bond for the full amount of damages and interest in case we are unsuccessful in our appeal. On September 30, 2021, we recorded an estimate for a contingent loss of $2.4 million related to the Empery litigation. In consultation with outside legal counsel, we believe that we have several meritorious defenses against the claims, and the decision of the Trial Court.\nOn December 28, 2021 Hudson Bay Master Fund (\u201cHudson\u201d) filed a lawsuit against us related to the notice of adjustment of the exercise price of and the number of warrant shares issuable under warrants issued to Hudson in January 2017. Hudson received 83,334 warrants in connection with the January 2017 offering.\nHudson\u2019s complaint alleges breach of contract and that Hudson is entitled to damages estimated at approximately $2.6 million as a result of certain adjustments to the exercise price and number of warrant shares issuable following the February 2018 financing transaction. In consultation with outside legal counsel, we believe that we have several meritorious defenses against Hudson\u2019s claims. We believe that Hudson\u2019s claims have no merit and we will vigorously defend such lawsuit.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our Board of Directors or management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that may depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our Board of Directors or our management. Our corporate governance documents include provisions:\n\u25cf providing that directors may be removed by stockholders with or without cause;\n\u25cf limiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings and to take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting;\n\u25cf requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors;\n\u25cf authorizing blank check preferred stock, which could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock; and\n\u25cf limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from engaging in certain business combinations with us. Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters\nOur business could suffer if we lose the services of key members of our senior management, key advisors or personnel.\nWe are dependent upon the continued services of key members of our senior management and a limited number of key advisors and personnel. The loss of any one of these individuals could disrupt our operations or our strategic plans. Additionally, our future success will depend on, among other things, our ability to continue to hire and retain the necessary qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel, for whom we compete with numerous other companies, academic institutions and organizations. The loss of members of our management team, key advisors or personnel, or our inability to attract or retain other qualified personnel or advisors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Though members of our sales force generally enter into noncompetition agreements that restrict their ability to compete with us, most of the members of our executive management team are not subject to such agreements. Accordingly, the adverse effect resulting from the loss of certain executives could be compounded by our inability to prevent them from competing with us.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, to provide accurate information to the FDA, to comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, to report financial information or data accurately, to disclose unauthorized activities to us or to comply with our code of business conduct and ethics. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, false claims, inappropriate promotion, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. The precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nEmployee litigation and unfavorable publicity could negatively affect our future business.\nOur employees may, from time to time, bring lawsuits against us regarding injury, creating a hostile work place, discrimination, wage and hour disputes, sexual harassment, or other employment issues. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of discrimination and harassment claims generally. Coupled with the expansion of social media platforms and similar devices that allow individuals access to a broad audience, these claims have had a significant negative impact on some businesses. Certain companies that have faced employment- or harassment-related lawsuits have had to terminate management or other key personnel, and have suffered reputational harm that has negatively impacted their business. If we were to face any employment-related claims, our business could be negatively affected.\nUnder applicable employment laws, we may not be able to enforce covenants not to compete and therefore may be unable to prevent our competitors from benefiting from the expertise of some of our former employees.\nWe generally enter into non-competition agreements with our employees and certain key consultants. These agreements prohibit our employees and certain key consultants, if they cease working for us, from competing directly with us or working for our competitors or clients for a limited period of time. We may be unable to enforce these agreements under the laws of the jurisdictions in which our employees work and it may be difficult for us to restrict our competitors from benefitting from the expertise our former employees or consultants developed while working for us. For example, Israeli courts have required employers seeking to enforce non-compete undertakings of a former employee to demonstrate that the competitive activities of the former employee will harm one of a limited number of material interests of the employer which have been recognized by the courts, such as the secrecy of a company\u2019s confidential commercial information or the protection of its intellectual property. If we cannot demonstrate that such interests will be harmed, we may be unable to prevent our competitors from benefiting from the expertise of our former employees or consultants and our ability to remain competitive may be diminished.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe increasing use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges.\nSocial media is increasingly being used to communicate about our research, development candidates, investigational medicines, and the diseases our development candidates and investigational medicines are being developed to treat. Social media practices in the biopharmaceutical industry continue to evolve and regulations relating to such use are not always clear. This evolution creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business, resulting in potential regulatory actions against us. For example, subjects may use social media channels to comment on their experience in an ongoing blinded clinical trial or to report an alleged adverse event. When such disclosures occur, there is a risk that we fail to monitor and comply with applicable adverse event reporting obligations or we may not be able to defend our business or the public\u2019s legitimate interests in the face of the political and market pressures generated by social media due to restrictions on what we may say about our development candidates and investigational medicines. There is also a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking website. If any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face regulatory actions, or incur other harm to our business.\nUnfavorable U.S. or global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and financial markets, including by the current COVID-19 pandemic, recent geopolitical events, unfavorable changes related to interest rates and rising inflation. The most recent global financial crisis caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn, such as the most recent global financial crisis, could result in a variety of risks to our business, including weakened demand for our investigational medicines and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on favorable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy could strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause delays in payments for our services by third-party payors or our collaborators. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.", "PERMNO": 18643, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "XAIR"}
