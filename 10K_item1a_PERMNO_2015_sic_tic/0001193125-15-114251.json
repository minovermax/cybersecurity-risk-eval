Risk Factors\nThe following important factors, among others, in some cases have affected, and in the future could affect, the Company\u2019s actual results and could cause the Company\u2019s actual consolidated results for the Company\u2019s current year and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.\nRisks Related to the Company\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition depended principally on the success of Three Lions, which recorded substantial unanticipated losses and has liquidated. Accordingly, we have recorded the total loss of our $8.5 million investment in Three Lions and did not receive any proceeds from Three Lions\u2019 liquidation. This has resulted in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe have not had an operating business since 2002. Since 2002, our Board of Directors has considered various alternative courses of action for our company, including possibly acquiring or combining with one or more operating businesses, and it has reviewed and analyzed a number of proposed transactions. In March 2013, we invested our remaining cash assets in the acquisition of a majority economic interest in Three Lions, a start-up television production company with a particular emphasis on branded entertainment and special events. In October 2013, we consummated a $5 million rights offering of our common stock to our existing shareholders to fund our remaining $3.5 million capital contribution to Three Lions and to provide working capital for us until Three Lions was projected to be able to provide us with distributions to help pay our operating costs. As a result of these transactions, since March 2013, our business has consisted almost entirely of acting as the majority equityholder of, and holding a membership interest in, Three Lions.\nThree Lions held its initial Fashion RocksTM broadcast on September 9, 2014 and experienced a ratings performance well below expectations. As a result of the poor ratings and sponsorship revenue that fell well short of projections, Three Lions recorded unanticipated losses of $7.5 million in connection with the broadcast. Three Lions sought out new financing sources to provide the necessary funding for Three Lions next production, but was not successful and unable to secure a new source of working capital. In a meeting held on October 27, 2014, and after reviewing financial information and projections provided by Three Lions and its advisors, the Executive Board of Three Lions considered and unanimously approved a plan proposed by Three Lions\u2019 management, with the assistance of its advisors, to proceed with the voluntary liquidation and dissolution of Three Lions in accordance with Delaware law. On January 30, 2015, Three Lions was dissolved with the filing of its Certificate of Cancellation with the state of Delaware. No amounts were distributed to us or to the other members of Three Lions in the liquidation.\nAccordingly, we have suffered the loss of our entire $8.5 million capital investment in Three Lions. We also lost our $199,583 cash collateralized bank letter of credit that we provided to support payments on an office lease obtained by Three Lions, and we incurred additional legal and other professional fees and associated costs in connection with Three Lions\u2019 liquidation totaling approximately $20,000. These losses have had and will continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur investment in Three Lions constituted our primary asset on our financial statement and we have no other assets with the potential of generating positive cash flow for us. Considering our current cash position of $1.0 million at December 31, 2014, our average historical spending to support continuing operations, and a short-term funding commitment from our largest shareholder, our management believes we have sufficient capital resources and liquidity to continue to operate in a manner consistent with our recent operations for at least one year. However, given our lack of an operating business or other revenue generating opportunities, our management believes that we will deplete our remaining cash resources in a little over one year. There can be no assurances that we will be able to secure financing or an operating business before our remaining cash is depleted. To the extent that we are unable to identify and obtain an alternate source of funds, we will likely be forced to liquidate.\nWe have a long history of net losses, no recent history of profitability, and no current operations or investments that would enable us to become profitable in the future.\nWe reported net losses of $3.6 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. These losses have increased significantly in 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a net loss of $7.0 million. We have not had an operating business since 2002. Our management had expected that our investment in Three Lions would eventually provide us with positive cash flow to help fund our operations. In light of the liquidation of Three Lions, we currently have no operations or investments that would enable us to become profitable in the future. While our Board of Directors has instructed management to explore all possible strategic options for us to secure additional financing and/or an operating business, there can be no assurances whatsoever that we will be able to identify a viable strategic option to enable us to continue operations. If we are unable to identify such a viable funding source, we will likely have to liquidate.\nWe only have sufficient cash to meet our operating needs for approximately 12 months and will likely need to liquidate if we are unable to secure new financing.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had a cash balance of approximately $1.0 million. Considering our average spending to support continuing operations and a short-term funding commitment from our largest shareholder, our management believes we have sufficient capital resources and liquidity to operate in a manner consistent with our recent operations for at least one year. However, given our lack of an operating business or other revenue generating opportunities, our management believes that we will deplete our remaining cash resources in a little over one year. There can be no assurances that we will be able to secure financing or an operating business before our remaining cash is depleted. To the extent that we are unable to identify and obtain an alternate source of funds, we will likely be forced to liquidate.\nAffiliates of Overseas Toys control us and may have conflicts of interest with our other stockholders.\nOverseas Toys beneficially owns approximately 87.6% of our common stock. As a result, Overseas Toys is able to control the election of our directors, determine our corporate and management policies and determine, without the consent of our other stockholders, the approval of any corporate transaction or the outcome of any other matter submitted to our stockholders for approval, including potential mergers, capital issues and other significant corporate transactions. This concentrated ownership position limits other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial.\nOverseas Toys is controlled by an affiliate of The Yucaipa Companies, or Yucaipa. Four of our six directors are also current or former directors or executive officers of, or advisors to, Yucaipa or certain of its portfolio companies. Overseas Toys also has sufficient voting power to amend our organizational documents. The interests of Overseas Toys may not coincide with the interests of other holders of our common stock. Additionally, Yucaipa and its affiliates are in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Yucaipa and its affiliates may also pursue, for their own account, acquisition opportunities that may be appropriate for us, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as Overseas Toys continues to own a significant amount of the outstanding shares of our common stock, it will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions, including potential mergers or acquisitions, asset sales, liquidation and dissolution, and other significant corporate transactions that our other stockholders may desire.\nWe may have a limited ability to use some or all of our net operating loss carryforwards in the future.\nAs a result of prior operating losses, we have net operating loss, or \u201cNOL,\u201d carryforwards for federal income tax purposes. The ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards to reduce taxable income in future years could become subject to significant limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code if we undergo an ownership change. We would undergo an ownership change if, among other things, the stockholders who own, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of our common stock, or are otherwise treated as \u201c5% shareholders\u201d under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, increase their aggregate percentage ownership of our stock by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock owned by these stockholders at any time during the testing period, which is generally the three-year period preceding the potential ownership change.\nIn the event of an ownership change, Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income a corporation may offset with NOL carryforwards. The annual limitation is generally equal to the value of the stock of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate for the month in which the ownership change occurs (the long-term tax-exempt rate for March 2015 is 2.67%). Any unused annual limitation may generally be carried over to later years until the NOL carryforwards expire. While we do not believe that our 2013 rights offering and the issuance of shares pursuant to exercised subscription rights triggered an ownership change upon the consummation of the rights offering, they could increase the likelihood that we may undergo an ownership change for purposes of Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code in the future.\nWe are dependent on certain key personnel.\nWe are dependent on several key personnel, including our directors. In light of our uncertain outlook, there is no assurance that our key personnel can be retained. The loss of the services of our key personnel would harm us. In addition, we have a limited number of personnel. As such, this presents a challenge in maintaining compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If Section 404 compliance is not properly maintained, our internal control over financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our auditors are not required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. As a result, investors may become less comfortable with the effectiveness of our internal controls and the risk that material weakness or other deficiencies in internal controls go undetected may increase.\nRisks Related to the Securities Markets and Ownership of our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate in the future and may continue to decline substantially.\nThe market price for our common stock has fluctuated in the past, and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate or decline substantially in the future, including:\n\u2022\nthe material adverse effect that the losses associated with our investment in Three Lions and the liquidation of Three Lions has had on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects;\n\u2022\nstockholder sentiment regarding the failure of our investment in Three Lions and the significant losses incurred by us in connection therewith;\n\u2022\nthe liquidation of Three Lions and the inability of Three Lions to generate revenue or distribute dividends to us and its other members;\n\u2022\nannouncements of developments related to our business or prospects;\n\u2022\nour dwindling cash resources, lack of any income generating assets and dim prospects for obtaining alternative sources of capital or debt financing;\n\u2022\nthe likelihood that we will need to liquidate in the near future if we do not obtain additional working capital;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our operations;\n\u2022\nissuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock into the marketplace, including upon the exercise of subscription rights;\n\u2022\ngeneral conditions in the domestic economy or the worldwide economy;\n\u2022\na shortfall in earnings compared to our stockholders\u2019 expectations;\n\u2022\nannouncements of new acquisitions or dispositions; and\n\u2022\nan outbreak of war or hostilities.\nDue to these factors, the price of our stock may decline even further or become worthless and investors may be unable to resell their shares of our stock for a profit or for any amount at all. If we do have to liquidate, it is likely that our shareholders will lose all or a substantial portion of their respective investments in our stock. In addition, the stock market experiences extreme volatility that often is unrelated to the performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may cause our stock price to decline regardless of our performance.\nThe trading volume of our common stock is very limited and if you invest you may have difficulty selling your shares in the future at the times and in the amounts you might want.\nWhile our common stock is quoted on the OTCQB Marketplace under the symbol \u201cSWWI,\u201d our stock is not listed on any stock exchange. The trading volume of our common stock is very limited. The limited trading market for our common stock may lead to exaggerated fluctuations in market prices and possible market inefficiencies, as compared to a more actively traded stock. It may also make it more difficult to dispose of our common stock at expected prices or at all, especially for holders seeking to dispose of a large number of shares of our stock.\nForward Looking Information\nFrom time to time, the Company may provide forward looking information such as forecasts of expected future performance or statements about the Company\u2019s plans and objectives. This information may be contained in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases, or oral statements by the officers of the Company. The Company desires to take advantage of the \u201cSafe Harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and these risk factors are intended to do so.", "PERMNO": 79376, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "SWWI"}
