{"cik": "1690680", "company": "NEWMARK GROUP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-20", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in shares of our Class A common stock involves risks and uncertainties, including the potential loss of all or a part of your investment. The following are important risks and uncertainties that could affect our business, but we do not ascribe any particular likelihood or probability to them unless specifically indicated. Before making an investment decision to purchase our common stock, you should carefully read and consider all of the risks and uncertainties described below, as well as other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included herein. The occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties that are currently immaterial or unknown could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, result of operations, cash flows or prospects.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nGlobal Economic and Market Conditions\nNegative general economic conditions and commercial real estate market conditions (including perceptions of such conditions) can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nCommercial real estate markets are cyclical. They relate to the condition of the economy or, at least, to the perceptions of investors and users as to the relevant economic outlook. For example, companies may be hesitant to expand their office space or enter into long-term real estate commitments if they are concerned about the general economic environment. Companies that are under financial pressure for any reason, or are attempting to more aggressively manage their expenses, may reduce the size of their workforces, limit capital expenditures, including with respect to their office space, permit more of their staff to work from home and/or seek corresponding reductions in office space and related management or other services.\nNegative general economic conditions and declines in the demand for commercial real estate brokerage and related management services in several markets or in significant markets could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects as a result of the following factors:\n\u2022\nA general decline in acquisition and disposition activity can lead to a reduction in the commissions and fees we receive for arranging such transactions, as well as in commissions and fees we earn for arranging the financing for acquirers.\n\u2022\nA general decline in the value and performance of commercial real estate and in rental rates can lead to a reduction in management and leasing commissions and fees. Additionally, such declines can lead to a reduction in commissions and fees that are based on the value of, or revenue produced by, the properties for which we provide services. This may include commissions and fees for appraisal and valuation, sales and leasing, and property and facilities management.\n\u2022\nCyclicality in the commercial real estate markets may lead to volatility in our earnings, and the commercial real estate business can be highly sensitive to market perception of the economy generally and our industry specifically. Real estate markets are also thought to \u201clag\u201d the broader economy. This means that, even when underlying economic fundamentals improve in a given market, it may take additional time for these improvements to translate into strength in the commercial real estate markets.\n\u2022\nIn weaker economic environments, income-producing multifamily real estate may experience higher property vacancies, lower investor and tenant demand and reduced values. In such environments, we could experience lower transaction volumes and transaction sizes as well as fewer loan originations with lower relative principal amounts, as well as potential credit losses arising from risk-sharing arrangements with respect to certain GSE loans.\n\u2022\nPeriods of economic weakness or recession, significantly rising interest rates, fiscal uncertainty, declining employment levels, declining demand for commercial real estate, falling real estate values, disruption to the global capital or credit markets, political uncertainty or the public perception that any of these events may occur, may negatively affect the performance of some or all of our business lines.\n\u2022\nOur ability to raise funding in the long-term or short-term debt capital markets or the equity capital markets, or to access secured lending markets could in the future be adversely affected by conditions in the United States and international economy and markets, with the cost and availability of funding adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads and changes in interest rates.\nWhile the U.S. commercial property market continues to display strength despite slowing growth of commercial property prices, according to Real Capital Analytics (which we refer to as \u201cRCA\u201d) as of January 25, 2018, there can be no assurances that such strength will continue. Although Newmark Research estimates that the spreads between commercial property capitalization rates for all property types and 10-year U.S. Treasuries remain around their long-term average, as of December 31, 2017, interest rates rose across the U.S. benchmark yield curve in 2017, due in part to expectations of increased economic growth due to recently enacted tax cuts. We would expect these expectations to fuel continued demand for commercial real estate for as long as the U.S. economy continues to expand at a moderate pace but there can be no assurances that such sentiment will continue.\nBusiness Concentration Risks\nOur business is geographically concentrated and could be significantly affected by any adverse change in the regions in which we operate.\nOur current business operations are primarily located in the United States. While we are expanding our business to new geographic areas, and operate internationally through our alliance with Knight Frank, we are still highly concentrated in the United States. Because we derived substantially all of our total revenues on a consolidated basis for the year ended December 31, 2017 from our operations in the United States, we are exposed to adverse competitive changes and economic downturns and changes in political conditions domestically. If we are unable to identify and successfully manage or mitigate these risks, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nThe concentration of business with corporate clients can increase business risk, and our business can be adversely affected due to the loss of certain of these clients.\nWe value the expansion of business relationships with individual corporate clients because of the increased efficiency and economics that can result from developing recurring business from performing an increasingly broad range of services for the same client. Although our client portfolio is currently highly diversified-for the year ended December 31, 2017, our top 10 clients, collectively, accounted for approximately 7% of our total revenue on a consolidated basis, and our largest client accounted for less than 2% of our total revenue on a consolidated basis. As we grow our business, relationships with certain corporate clients may increase, and our client portfolio may become increasingly concentrated. For example, part of our strategy is to increase our GCS revenues which may lead to an increase in corporate clients and therefore greater concentration of revenues. Having increasingly large and concentrated clients also can lead to greater or more concentrated risks if, among other possibilities, any such client;\n\u2022\nexperiences its own financial problems;\n\u2022\nbecomes bankrupt or insolvent, which can lead to our failure to be paid for services we have previously provided or funds we have previously advanced;\n\u2022\ndecides to reduce its operations or its real estate facilities;\n\u2022\nmakes a change in its real estate strategy, such as no longer outsourcing its real estate operations;\n\u2022\ndecides to change its providers of real estate services; or\n\u2022\nmerges with another corporation or otherwise undergoes a change of control, which may result in new management taking over with a different real estate philosophy or in different relationships with other real estate providers.\nWhere we provide real estate services to firms in the financial services industry, including banks and investment banks, we are experiencing indirectly the increasing extent of the regulatory environment to which they are subject in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. This increases the cost of doing business with them, which we are not always able to pass on, as the result of the additional resources and processes we are required to provide as a critical supplier.\nCompetition\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry with numerous competitors, some of which may have greater financial and operational resources than we do.\nWe compete to provide a variety of services within the commercial real estate industry. Each of these business disciplines is highly competitive on a local, regional, national and global level. We face competition not only from other national real estate service companies, but also from global real estate services companies, boutique real estate advisory firms, and consulting and appraisal firms. Depending on the product or service, we also face competition from other real estate service providers, institutional lenders, insurance companies, investment banking firms, commercial banks, investment managers and accounting firms, some of which may have greater financial resources than we do. Although many of our competitors are local or regional firms that are substantially smaller than we are, some of our competitors are substantially larger than us on a local, regional, national or international basis and have similar service competencies to ours. Such competitors include CBRE Group, Inc., Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated, Cushman & Wakefield, Savills Studley, Inc. and Colliers International. In addition, specialized firms like Walker & Dunlop, Inc., Berkadia Commercial Mortgage, LLC, HFF, Inc., Marcus & Millichap Inc. and Eastdil Secured, LLC compete with us in certain product offerings. Our industry has continued to consolidate, and there is an inherent risk that competitive firms may be more successful than we are at growing through merger and acquisition activity. See \u201cItem 1 - Business-Competition.\u201d In general, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete effectively with respect to any of our commercial real estate business lines or on an overall basis, to maintain current commission and fee levels or margins, or to maintain or increase our market share.\nAdditionally, competitive conditions, particularly in connection with increasingly large clients, may require us to compromise on certain contract terms with respect to the extent of risk transfer, acting as principal rather than agent in connection with supplier relationships, liability limitations and other terms and conditions. Where competitive pressures result in higher levels of potential liability under our contracts, the cost of operational errors and other activities for which we have indemnified our clients will be greater and may not be fully insured.\nNew Opportunities/Possible Transactions and Hires\nIf we are unable to identify and successfully exploit new product, service and market opportunities, including through hiring new brokers, salespeople, managers and other professionals, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nBecause of significant competition in our market, our strategy is to broker more transactions, manage more properties, increase our share of existing markets and seek out new clients and markets. We may face enhanced risks as these efforts to expand our business result in our transacting with a broader array of clients and expose us to new products and services and markets. Pursuing this strategy may also require significant management attention and hiring expense and potential costs and liability in any litigation or arbitration that may result. We may not be able to attract new clients or brokers, salespeople, managers, or other professionals or successfully\nenter new markets. If we are unable to identify and successfully exploit new product, service and market opportunities, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may pursue strategic alliances, acquisitions, joint ventures or other growth opportunities (including hiring new brokers), which could present unforeseen integration obstacles or costs and could dilute our stockholders. We may also face competition in our acquisition strategy, and such competition may limit our number of strategic alliances, acquisitions, joint ventures and other growth opportunities (including hiring new brokers).\nWe have explored a wide range of strategic alliances, acquisitions and joint ventures with other real estate services firms, including maintaining or developing relationships with independently owned offices, and with other companies that have interests in businesses in which there are brokerage, management or other strategic opportunities. We continue to evaluate and potentially pursue possible strategic alliances, acquisitions, joint ventures and other growth opportunities (including hiring new brokers). Such transactions may be necessary in order for us to enter into or develop new products or services or markets, as well as to strengthen our current ones.\nStrategic alliances, acquisitions, joint ventures and other growth opportunities (including hiring new brokers) specifically involve a number of risks and challenges, including:\n\u2022\npotential disruption of our ongoing business and product, service and market development and distraction of management;\n\u2022\ndifficulty retaining and integrating personnel and integrating administrative, operational, financial reporting, internal control, compliance, technology and other systems;\n\u2022\nthe necessity of hiring additional management and other critical personnel and integrating them into current operations;\n\u2022\nincreasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;\n\u2022\nthe risks relating to integrating accounting and financial systems and accounting policies and the related risk of having to restate our historical financial statements;\n\u2022\npotential dependence upon, and exposure to liability, loss or reputational damage relating to systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control;\n\u2022\naddition of business lines in which we have not previously engaged;\n\u2022\npotential unfavorable reaction to our strategic alliance, acquisition or joint venture strategy by our clients;\n\u2022\nto the extent that we pursue opportunities outside the United States, exposure to political, economic, legal, regulatory, operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in a foreign country, including risks of possible nationalization and/or foreign ownership restrictions, expropriation, price controls, capital controls, foreign currency fluctuations, regulatory and tax requirements, economic and/or political instability, geographic, time zone, language and cultural differences among personnel in different areas of the world, exchange controls and other restrictive government actions, as well as the outbreak of hostilities;\n\u2022\nthe upfront costs associated with pursuing transactions and recruiting personnel, which efforts may be unsuccessful in the increasingly competitive marketplace for the most talented producers and managers;\n\u2022\nconflicts or disagreements between any strategic alliance or joint venture partner and us;\n\u2022\nexposure to potential unknown liabilities of any acquired business, strategic alliance or joint venture that are significantly larger than we anticipate at the time of acquisition, and unforeseen increased\nexpenses or delays associated with acquisitions, including costs in excess of the cash transition costs that we estimate at the outset of a transaction;\n\u2022\nreduction in availability of financing due to credit rating downgrades or defaults by us in connection with strategic alliances, acquisitions, joint ventures and other growth opportunities;\n\u2022\na significant increase in the level of our indebtedness in order to generate significant cash resources that may be required to effect acquisitions;\n\u2022\ndilution resulting from any issuances of shares of our common stock or limited partnership units in connection with strategic alliances, acquisitions, joint ventures and other growth opportunities;\n\u2022\nadverse effects on our liquidity as a result of payment of cash resources and/or issuance of shares of our common stock or limited partnership units of Newmark OpCo; and\n\u2022\na lag in the realization of financial benefits from these transactions and arrangements.\nWe face competition for acquisition targets, which may limit our number of acquisitions and growth opportunities and may lead to higher acquisition prices or other less favorable terms. To the extent that we choose to grow internationally from acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures or other growth opportunities, we may experience additional expenses or obstacles, including the short-term contractual restrictions contained in our agreement with Knight Frank, which such agreement could both affect and be affected by such choice. See \u201cItem 1 - Business-Our Knight Frank Partnership.\u201d There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, acquire or profitably manage additional businesses or integrate successfully any acquired businesses without substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial difficulties.\nAny future growth will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable transactional candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions, which may not be available to us, as well as sufficient liquidity and credit to fund these transactions. Future transactions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transaction-related expenses, which include payment of break-up fees, assumption of liabilities, including compensation, severance and lease termination costs, and transaction and deferred financing costs, among others. In addition, there can be no assurance that such transactions will be accretive or generate favorable operating margins. The success of these transactions will also be determined in part by the ongoing performance of the acquired companies and the acceptance of acquired employees of our partnership compensation structure and other variables which may be different from the existing industry standards or practices at the acquired companies.\nWe will need to successfully manage the integration of recent acquisitions and future growth effectively. The integration and additional growth may place a significant strain upon our management, administrative, operational, financial reporting, internal control and compliance infrastructure. Our ability to grow depends upon our ability to successfully hire, train, supervise and manage additional employees, expand our operational, financial reporting, compliance and other control systems effectively, allocate our human resources optimally, maintain clear lines of communication between our transactional and management functions and our finance and accounting functions, and manage the pressure on our management, administrative, operational, financial reporting, internal control and compliance infrastructure. Additionally, managing future growth may be difficult due to our new geographic locations, markets and business lines. As a result of these risks and challenges, we may not realize the full benefits that we anticipate from strategic alliances, acquisitions, joint ventures or other growth opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to accurately anticipate and respond to the changing demands we will face as we integrate and continue to expand our operations, and we may not be able to manage growth effectively or to achieve growth at all. Any failure to manage the integration of acquisitions and other growth opportunities effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRegulatory/Legal\nWe may have liabilities in connection with our business, including appraisal and valuation, sales and leasing and property and facilities management activities.\nAs a licensed real estate broker and provider of commercial real estate services, we and our licensed sales professionals and independent contractors that work for us are subject to statutory due diligence, disclosure and standard-of-care obligations. Failure to fulfill these obligations could subject us or our sales professionals or independent contractors to litigation from parties who purchased, sold or leased properties that we brokered or managed.\nWe could become subject to claims by participants in real estate sales and leasing transactions, as well as building owners and companies for whom we provide management services, claiming that we did not fulfill our obligations. We could also become subject to claims made by clients for whom we provided appraisal and valuation services and/or third parties who perceive themselves as having been negatively affected by our appraisals and/or valuations. We also could be subject to audits and/or fines from various local real estate authorities if they determine that we are violating licensing laws by failing to follow certain laws, rules and regulations. While these liabilities have been insignificant in the past, we have no assurance that this will continue to be the case.\nIn our property and facilities management business, we hire and supervise third-party contractors to provide services for our managed properties. We may be subject to claims for defects, negligent performance of work or other similar actions or omissions by third parties we do not control. Moreover, our clients may seek to hold us accountable for the actions of contractors because of our role as property or facilities manager or project manager, even if we have technically disclaimed liability as a contractual matter, in which case we may be pressured to participate in a financial settlement for purposes of preserving the client relationship. While these liabilities have been insignificant in the past, we have no assurance that this will continue to be the case.\nBecause we employ large numbers of building staff in facilities that we manage, we face risk in potential claims relating to employment injuries, termination and other employment matters. While these risks are generally passed back to the building owner, we have no assurance it will continue to be the case.\nIn connection with a limited number of our facilities management agreements, we have guaranteed that the client will achieve certain savings objectives. In the event that these objectives are not met, we are obligated to pay the shortfall amount to the client. In most instances, the obligation to pay such amount is limited to the amount of fees (or the amount of a subset of the fees) earned by us under the contract, but no assurance can be given that we will be able to mitigate against these payments or that the payments, particularly if aggregated with those required under other agreements, would not have a material adverse effect on our ongoing arrangements with particular clients or our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. The percentage of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 subject to such obligations under our current facilities management agreements is less than 1%. While these liabilities have been immaterial to date, we have no assurance that this will continue to be the case.\nAdverse outcomes of property and facilities management disputes or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, particularly to the extent we may be liable on our contracts, or if our liabilities exceed the amounts of the insurance coverage procured and maintained by us. Some of these litigation risks may be mitigated by any commercial insurance we maintain in amounts we believe are appropriate. However, in the event of a substantial loss or certain types of claims, our insurance coverage and/or self-insurance reserve levels might not be sufficient to pay the full damages. Additionally, in the event of grossly negligent or intentionally wrongful conduct, insurance policies that we may have may not cover us at all. Further, the value of otherwise valid claims we hold under insurance policies could become uncollectible in the event of the covering insurance company\u2019s insolvency, although we seek to limit this risk by placing our commercial insurance only with highly rated companies. Any of these events could materially\nnegatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. While these liabilities have been insignificant in the past, we have no assurance that this will continue to be the case.\nIf we fail to comply with laws, rules and regulations applicable to commercial real estate brokerage, valuation and appraisal and mortgage transactions and our other business lines, then we may incur significant financial penalties.\nDue to the broad geographic scope of our operations throughout North America and the commercial real estate services we perform, we are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations specific to our services. For example, the brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and other related activities require us to maintain brokerage licenses in each state in which we conduct activities for which a real estate license is required. We also maintain certain state licenses in connection with our lending, servicing and brokerage of commercial and multifamily mortgage loans. If we fail to maintain our licenses or conduct brokerage activities without a license or violate any of the laws, rules and regulations applicable to our licenses, then we may be subject to audits, required to pay fines (including treble damages in certain states) or be prevented from collecting commissions owed, be compelled to return commissions received or have our licenses suspended or revoked.\nIn addition, because the size and scope of commercial real estate transactions have increased significantly during the past several years, both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with the numerous state licensing and regulatory regimes and the possible loss resulting from non-compliance have increased. Furthermore, the laws, rules and regulations applicable to our business lines also may change in ways that increase the costs of compliance. The failure to comply with federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations could result in significant financial penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe loss of relationships with the GSEs and HUD would, and changes in such relationships could, adversely affect our ability to originate commercial real estate loans through such programs. Compliance with the minimum collateral and risk-sharing requirements of such programs, as well as applicable state and local licensing agencies, could reduce our liquidity.\nCurrently, through Berkeley Point, we originate a significant percentage of our loans for sale through the GSEs and HUD programs. Berkeley Point is approved as a Fannie Mae DUS lender, a Freddie Mac Program Plus seller/servicer, a Freddie Mac Targeted Affordable Housing Seller, a HUD MAP lender nationwide, and a Ginnie Mae issuer. Our status as an approved lender affords us a number of advantages, which may be terminated by the applicable GSE or HUD at any time. Although we intend to take all actions to remain in compliance with the requirements of these programs, as well as applicable state and local licensing agencies, the loss of such status would, or changes in our relationships with the GSEs and HUD could, prevent us from being able to originate commercial real estate loans for sale through the particular GSE or HUD, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. It could also result in a loss of similar approvals from the GSEs or HUD. As of December 31, 2017, we exceeded the most restrictive applicable net worth requirement of these programs by approximately $347.4 million. In addition, over the last 10 years, Berkeley Point has achieved better 60 day+ delinquency rates than the industry average.\nWe are subject to risk of loss in connection with defaults on loans sold under the Fannie Mae DUS program that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity.\nUnder the Fannie Mae DUS program, we originate and service multifamily loans for Fannie Mae without having to obtain Fannie Mae\u2019s prior approval for certain loans, as long as the loans meet the underwriting guidelines set forth by Fannie Mae. In return for the delegated authority to make loans and the commitment to purchase loans by Fannie Mae, we must maintain minimum collateral and generally are required to share risk of loss on loans sold through Fannie Mae. With respect to most loans, we are generally required to absorb\napproximately one-third of any losses on the unpaid principal balance of a loan at the time of loss settlement. Some of the loans that we originate under the Fannie Mae DUS program are subject to reduced levels or no risk-sharing. However, we generally receive lower servicing fees with respect to such loans. Although our Berkeley Point business\u2019s average annual losses from such risk-sharing programs have been a minimal percentage of the aggregate principal amount of such loans to date, if loan defaults increase, actual risk-sharing obligation payments under the Fannie Mae DUS program could increase, and such defaults could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, a material failure to pay our share of losses under the Fannie Mae DUS program could result in the revocation of Berkeley Point\u2019s license from Fannie Mae and the exercise of various remedies available to Fannie Mae under the Fannie Mae DUS program.\nA change to the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and related actions, along with any changes in laws and regulations affecting the relationship between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the U.S. federal government or the existence of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nEach GSE has been created under a conservatorship established by its regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, since 2008. The conservatorship is a statutory process designed to preserve and conserve the GSEs\u2019 assets and property and put them in a sound and solvent condition. The conservatorships have no specified termination dates. There has been significant uncertainty regarding the future of the GSEs, including how long they will continue to exist in their current forms. Changes in such forms could eliminate or substantially reduce the number of loans we originate with the GSEs. Policymakers and others have focused significant attention in recent years on how to reform the nation\u2019s housing finance system, including what role, if any, the GSEs should play. Such reforms could significantly limit the role of the GSEs in the nation\u2019s housing finance system. Any such reduction in the loans we originate with the GSEs could lead to a reduction in fees related to the loans we originate or service. These effects could cause our Berkeley Point business to realize significantly lower revenues from its loan originations and servicing fees, and ultimately could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nEnvironmental regulations may adversely impact our commercial real estate business and/or cause us to incur costs for cleanup of hazardous substances or wastes or other environmental liabilities.\nFederal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations impose various environmental zoning restrictions, use controls, and disclosure obligations which impact the management, development, use and/or sale of real estate. Such laws and regulations tend to discourage sales and leasing activities, as well as mortgage lending availability, with respect to some properties. A decrease or delay in such transactions may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, a failure by us to disclose environmental concerns in connection with a real estate transaction may subject us to liability to a buyer/seller or lessee/lessor of property. While historically we have not incurred any significant liability in connection with these types of environmental issues, there is no assurance that this will not occur.\nIn addition, in our role as property or facilities manager, we could incur liability under environmental laws for the investigation or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes relating to properties we currently or formerly managed. Such liability may be imposed without regard to the lawfulness of the original disposal activity, or our knowledge of, or fault for, the release or contamination. Further, liability under some of these laws may be joint and several, meaning that one liable party could be held responsible for all costs related to a contaminated site. Insurance for such matters may not be available or sufficient. While historically we have not incurred any significant liability under these laws, this may not always be the case.\nCertain requirements governing the removal or encapsulation of asbestos-containing materials, as well as recently enacted local ordinances obligating property or facilities managers to inspect for and remove lead-based paint in certain buildings, could increase our costs of legal compliance and potentially subject us to violations or\nclaims. More stringent enforcement of existing regulations could cause us to incur significant costs in the future, and/or materially and adversely impact our commercial real estate brokerage and management services business.\nOur operations are affected by federal, state and/or local environmental laws in the jurisdictions in which we maintain office space for our own operations and where we manage properties for clients, and we may face liability with respect to environmental issues occurring at properties that we occupy or manage.\nVarious laws, rules and regulations restrict the levels of certain substances that may be discharged into the environment by properties and such laws, rules and regulations may impose liability on current or previous real estate owners or operators for the cost of investigating, cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at the property. We may face costs or liabilities under these laws as a result of our role as an on-site property manager. While we believe that we have taken adequate measures to prevent any such losses, no assurances can be given that these events will not occur. Within our own operations, we face additional costs from rising costs of environmental compliance, which make it more expensive to operate our corporate offices. Our operations are generally conducted within leased office building space, and, accordingly, we do not currently anticipate that regulations restricting the emissions of greenhouse gases, or taxes that may be imposed on their release, would result in material costs or capital expenditures. However, we cannot be certain about the extent to which such regulations will develop as there are higher levels of understanding and commitments by different governments in the United States and around the world regarding risks related to the climate and how they should be mitigated.\nWe may be adversely affected by the impact of recent income tax regulations.\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (which we refer to as the \u201cIRS\u201d) recently released final and temporary regulations regarding the treatment of certain related-party corporate debt as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These regulations include provisions that may adversely affect the tax consequences of common transactions, including intercompany obligations and/or financing, and may impact many companies in the real estate services sector, including several of our clients and competitors. These regulations could have an adverse impact on our income tax position or could possibly cause us to change the manner in which we conduct certain activities in ways that impose other costs on us. These regulations were issued recently, are highly complex and there is limited guidance regarding their application. Accordingly, we are unable to predict the extent, if any, to which such regulations would have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOn December 22, 2017, \u201cH.R.1,\u201d formerly known as the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d)\u201d was signed into law in the U.S. The Tax Act is expected to have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate and net income as reported under generally accepted accounting principles both in the first quarter of 2018 and subsequent reporting periods to which the Tax Act is effective. The final impact of the Tax Act may differ from our estimate for the provision for income taxes, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations, additional guidance that may be issued, unexpected negative changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits, and actions taken by us as a result of the Tax Act.\nIntellectual Property\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights or may be prevented from using intellectual property used in our business.\nOur success is dependent, in part, upon our intellectual property. We rely primarily on trade secret, contract, patent, copyright and trademark law in the United States and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights to proprietary technologies, products, services or methods, and our brand.\nUnauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results. We cannot ensure that our intellectual property rights are sufficient to protect our competitive\nadvantages or that any particular patent, copyright or trademark is valid and enforceable, and all patents ultimately expire. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws in the United States, or at all. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete.\nProtecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Although we have taken steps to protect ourselves, there can be no assurance that we will be aware of all patents, copyrights or trademarks that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services. Generally, it is not economically practicable to determine in advance whether our products or services may infringe the present or future rights of others.\nAccordingly, we may face claims of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights that could interfere with our ability to use intellectual property or technology that is material to our business. The number of such third-party claims may grow. Our technologies may not be able to withstand such third-party claims or rights against their use.\nWe may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of the rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. For example, we recently responded to a claim by Newmark Realty Capital, Inc. (which we refer to as \u201cRealty Capital\u201d) against us alleging, among other things, trademark infringement under Section 32 of the Lanham Act. In connection with our answer, we filed counterclaims alleging that Realty Capital has infringed our trademarks and seeking an order cancelling Realty Capital\u2019s registered trademarks. We also separately initiated an action before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office seeking invalidation of Realty Capital\u2019s registration of a design mark that includes the stand-alone name \u201cNewmark.\u201d On November 16, 2017, a federal court in the Northern District of California issued an order denying Realty Capital\u2019s motion to enjoin us from using the name \u201cNewmark\u201d generally as a trademark, which supported Newmark\u2019s rights and longstanding goodwill in relation to the use of the \u201cNewmark\u201d name. The same order temporarily enjoined Newmark from using the name \u201cNewmark\u201d for \u201cmortgage banking, mortgage brokerage, loan servicing, investment brokerage, and investment consulting services in the field of commercial real estate.\u201d This order is in effect until a decision at trial, which is currently scheduled for January 2019. We have moved the court for an order reconsidering the injunction and lifting it in its entirety, and may eventually file an appeal if necessary. In response to our request that the court stay the injunction pending reconsideration, the court ruled in our favor and has suspended the injunction as to the categories of \u201cinvestment consulting\u201d and \u201cinvestment brokerage.\u201d In advance of the motion for reconsideration hearing, Realty Capital filed a motion for a new injunction prohibiting the use of \u201cNewmark\u201d for \u201cany commercial real estate services\u201d and demanding relief more expansive than the request the Court previously denied on November 16, 2017. We believe this latest submission is legally and factually meritless and filed in bad faith and have taken, and will continue to take, appropriate action to address it. No assurance can be given as to whether these cases will ultimately be determined in our favor or that our ability to use the \u201cNewmark\u201d name will be impacted by the proceedings. Any such claims or litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs, the diversion of resources and the attention of management, any of which could materially negatively affect our business. Responding to these claims could also require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming infringement, stop selling or redesign affected products or services or pay damages on our own behalf or to satisfy indemnification commitments with our clients. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if available, may not be available on terms acceptable to us, and may negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Despite these potential risks, even if we are permanently enjoined from using the \u201cNewmark\u201d name in the sectors described in the preliminary injunction order or in connection with commercial real estate services generally, we do not believe such an order would significantly affect our long-term prospects.\nIf our software licenses from third parties are terminated or adversely changed or amended or contain material defects or errors, or if any of these third parties were to cease doing business, or if products or services offered by third parties were to contain material defects or errors, our ability to operate our businesses may be materially adversely affected.\nWe license databases and software from third parties, much of which is integral to our systems and our business. The licenses are terminable if we breach our obligations under the license agreements. If any material licenses were terminated or adversely changed or amended, if any of these third parties were to cease doing business or if any licensed software or databases licensed by these third parties were to contain material defects or errors, we may be forced to spend significant time and money to replace the licensed software and databases, and our ability to operate our business may be materially adversely affected. Further, any errors or defects in third-party services or products (including hardware, software, databases, cloud computing and other platforms and systems) or in services or products that we develop ourselves, could result in errors in, or a failure of our services or products, which could harm our business. Although we take steps to locate replacements, there can be no assurance that the necessary replacements will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. There can be no assurance that we will have an ongoing license to use all intellectual property which our systems require, the failure of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIT Systems and Cyber-security Risks\nDefects or disruptions in our technology or services could diminish demand for our products and service and subject us to liability.\nBecause our technology, products and services are complex and use or incorporate a variety of computer hardware, software and databases, both developed in-house and acquired from third-party vendors, our technology, products and services may have errors or defects. Errors and defects could result in unanticipated downtime or failure, and could cause financial loss and harm to our reputation and our business. Furthermore, if we acquire companies, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies and maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our technology, products and services.\nIf we experience computer systems failures or capacity constraints, our ability to conduct our business operations could be materially harmed.\nIf we experience computer systems failures or capacity constraints, our ability to conduct our business operations could be harmed. We support and maintain many of our computer systems and networks internally. Our failure to monitor or maintain these systems and networks or, if necessary, to find a replacement for this technology in a timely and cost-effective manner, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAlthough all of our business critical systems have been designed and implemented with fault tolerant and/or redundant clustered hardware and diversely routed network connectivity, our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans may prove to be inadequate. We may be subject to system failures and outages that might impact our revenues and relationships with clients. In addition, we will be subject to risk in the event that systems of our clients, business partners, vendors and other third parties are subject to failures and outages.\nWe rely on various third parties for computer and communications systems, such as telephone companies, online service providers, data processors, and software and hardware vendors. Our systems, or those of our third-party providers, may fail or operate slowly, causing one or more of the following, which may not in all cases be covered by insurance:\n\u2022\nunanticipated disruptions in service to our clients;\n\u2022\nslower response times;\n\u2022\nfinancial losses;\n\u2022\nlitigation or other client claims; and\n\u2022\nregulatory actions.\nWe may experience additional systems failures in the future from power or telecommunications failures, acts of God or war, weather-related events, terrorist attacks, human error, natural disasters, fire, power loss, sabotage, cyber-attacks, hardware or software malfunctions or defects, computer viruses, intentional acts of vandalism and similar events. Any system failure that causes an interruption in service or decreases the responsiveness of our service could damage our reputation, business and brand name.\nMalicious cyber-attacks and other adverse events affecting our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses or regulatory penalties.\nDeveloping and maintaining our operational systems and infrastructure is challenging, particularly as a result of rapidly evolving legal and regulatory requirements and technological shifts. Our financial, accounting, data processing or other operating and compliance systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as a malicious cyber-attack or other adverse events, which may adversely affect our ability to provide services.\nIn addition, our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures such as software programs, firewalls and similar technology, to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our and our clients\u2019 information, and endeavor to modify these protective measures as circumstances warrant, the nature of cyber threats continues to evolve. As a result, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability or disruption of service, computer viruses, acts of vandalism, or other malicious code, cyber-attack and other adverse events that could have an adverse security impact. Despite the defensive measures we have taken, these threats may come from external factors such as governments, organized crime, hackers, and other third parties such as outsource or infrastructure-support providers and application developers, or may originate internally from within us.\nWe also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities. Such parties could also be the source of a cyber-attack on or breach of our operational systems, data or infrastructure.\nThere have been an increasing number of cyber-attacks in recent years in various industries, and cyber-security risk management has been the subject of increasing focus by our regulators. If one or more cyber-attacks occur, it could potentially jeopardize the confidential, proprietary and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, as well as our clients\u2019 or other third parties\u2019, operations, which could result in reputational damage, financial losses and/or client dissatisfaction, which may not in all cases be covered by insurance. Any such cyber incidents involving our computer systems and networks, or those of third parties important to our business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nNatural Disasters, Weather-Related Events, Terrorist Attacks and Other Disruptions to Infrastructure\nOur ability to conduct our business may be materially adversely impacted by catastrophic events, including natural disasters, weather-related events, terrorist attacks and other disruptions.\nWe may encounter disruptions involving power, communications, transportation or other utilities or essential services depended on by us or by third parties with whom we conduct business. This could include\ndisruptions as the result of natural disasters, pandemics or weather-related or similar events, such as fires, hurricanes, earthquakes and floods, political instability, labor strikes or turmoil or terrorist attacks. For example, during 2012, our own operations and properties we manage for clients in the northeastern United States, and in particular New York City, were impacted by Hurricane Sandy, in some cases significantly. In 2017, several parts of the United States, including Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, sustained significant damage from hurricanes. We continue to assess the impact on our borrowers and other clients and what impact, if any, these hurricanes could have on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThese disruptions may occur, for example, as a result of events affecting only the buildings in which we operate (such as fires), or as a result of events with a broader impact on the communities where those buildings are located. If a disruption occurs in one location and persons in that location are unable to communicate with or travel to or work from other locations, our ability to service and interact with our clients and others may suffer, and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communications or travel.\nSuch events can result in significant injuries and loss of life, which could result in material financial liabilities, loss of business and reputational harm. They can also impact the availability and/or loss of commercial insurance policies, both for our own business and for those clients whose properties we manage and who may purchase their insurance through the insurance buying programs we make available to them.\nThere can be no assurance that the disaster recovery and crisis management procedures we employ will suffice in any particular situation to avoid a significant loss. Given that our employees are increasingly mobile and less reliant on physical presence in our offices, our disaster recovery plans increasingly rely on the availability of the Internet (including \u201ccloud\u201d technology) and mobile phone technology, so the disruption of those systems would likely affect our ability to recover promptly from a crisis situation. Although we maintain insurance for liability, property damage and business interruption, subject to deductibles and various exceptions, no assurance can be given that our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will not be materially negatively affected by such events in the future.\nKey Employees\nOur ability to retain our key employees and the ability of certain key employees to devote adequate time to us are critical to the success of our business, and failure to do so may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur people are our most important resource. We must retain the services of our key employees and strategically recruit and hire new talented employees to attract clients and transactions that generate most of our revenues.\nHoward W. Lutnick, who serves as our Chairman, is also the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of our indirect parent, Cantor, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CFGM, which is the managing general partner of Cantor, and Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of our direct parent, BGC Partners. In addition, Mr. Lutnick holds offices at various other affiliates of Cantor and provides services to BGC U.S. OpCo, BGC Global OpCo, Cantor operating entities, and Newmark OpCo. Mr. Lutnick is not subject to an employment agreement with us or any of our subsidiaries.\nCurrently, Mr. Lutnick spends significant amounts of his BGC Partners time on our matters, although this percentage may vary depending on business developments at Newmark or Cantor, BGC Partners or any of our or their respective affiliates. As a result, Mr. Lutnick dedicates only a portion of his professional efforts to our business and operations, and there is no contractual obligation for Mr. Lutnick to spend a specific amount of his time with us and/or BGC Partners or Cantor. Mr. Lutnick may not be able to dedicate adequate time to our business and operations, and we could experience an adverse effect on our operations due to the demands placed on our management team by other professional obligations. In addition, Mr. Lutnick\u2019s other responsibilities could cause conflicts of interest with us. The Newmark Holdings limited partnership agreement, which includes\nnon-competition and other arrangements applicable to our key employees who are limited partners of Newmark Holdings, may not prevent certain of our key employees, including Mr. Lutnick, whose employment by Cantor and BGC Partners is not subject to these provisions in the Newmark Holdings limited partnership agreement, from resigning or competing against us.\nShould Mr. Lutnick leave or otherwise become unavailable to render services to us, ultimate control of us would likely pass to Cantor, and indirectly pass to the then-controlling stockholder of CFGM (which is currently Mr. Lutnick), Cantor\u2019s managing general partner, or to such other managing general partner as CFGM would appoint, and as a result control could remain with Mr. Lutnick.\nIn addition, our success has largely been dependent on executive officers such as Barry M. Gosin, who serves as our Chief Executive Officer, and other key employees, including some who have been hired in connection with acquisitions. If any of our key employees were to join an existing competitor, form a competing company, offer services to BGC Partners or Cantor that compete with our services or otherwise leave us, some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor or another competitor instead of our services, which could adversely affect our revenues and as a result could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nSeasonality\nOur business is generally affected by seasonality, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period.\nDue to the strong desire of many market participants to close real estate transactions prior to the end of a calendar year, our business exhibits certain seasonality, with our revenue tending to be lowest in the first quarter and strongest in the fourth quarter. This could have a material effect on our results of operations in any given period.\nThe seasonality of our business makes it difficult to determine during the course of the year whether planned results will be achieved and to adjust to changes in expectations. To the extent that we are not able to identify and adjust for changes in expectations or we are confronted with negative conditions that inordinately impact seasonal norms, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nOther General Business Risks\nIf we experience difficulties in collecting accounts receivable or experience defaults by multiple clients, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe face challenges in our ability to efficiently and/or effectively collect accounts receivable. Any of our clients or other parties obligated to make payments to us may experience a downturn in their business that may weaken their results of operations and financial condition. As a result, a client or other party obligated to make payments to us may fail to make payments when due, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy. A bankruptcy of a client or other party obligated to make payments to us would delay or preclude full collection of amounts owed to us. In addition, certain corporate services and property and facilities management agreements require that we advance payroll and other vendor costs on behalf of clients. If such a client or other party obligated to make payments to us were to file for bankruptcy, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for those costs or for the severance obligations we would incur. Any such failure to make payments when due or the bankruptcy or insolvency of a large number of our clients (e.g., during an economic downturn) could result in disruption to our business and material losses to us. While historically we have not incurred material losses as a result of the difficulties described above, this may not always be the case.\nWe may not be able to replace partner offices when affiliation agreements are terminated, which may decrease our scope of services and geographic reach.\nWe have agreements in place to operate on a collaborative and cross-referral basis with certain offices in the United States and elsewhere in the Americas in return for contractual and referral fees paid to us and/or certain mutually beneficial co-branding and other business arrangements. These independently owned offices generally use some variation of Newmark in their names and marketing materials. These agreements are normally multi-year contracts, and generally provide for mutual referrals in their respective markets, generating additional contract and brokerage fees. Through these independently owned offices, our clients have access to additional brokers with local market research capabilities as well as other commercial real estate services in locations where we do not have a physical presence. From time to time our arrangement with these independent firms may be terminated pursuant to the terms of the individual affiliation agreements. The opening of a Company-owned office to replace an independent office requires us to invest capital, which in some cases could be material. There can be no assurance that, if we lose additional independently owned offices, we will be able to identify suitable replacement affiliates or fund the establishment or acquisition of an owned office. In addition, although we do not control the activities of these independently owned offices and are not responsible for their liabilities, we may face reputational risk if any of these independently owned offices are involved in or accused of illegal, unethical or similar behavior. Failure to maintain coverage in important geographic markets may negatively impact our operations, reputation and ability to attract and retain key employees and expand domestically and internationally and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nDeclines in or terminations of servicing engagements or breaches of servicing agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe expect that loan servicing fees will continue to constitute a significant portion of our revenues from the Berkeley Point business for the foreseeable future. Nearly all of these fees are derived from loans that Berkeley Point originates and sells through the agencies\u2019 programs or places with institutional investors. A decline in the number or value of loans that we originate for these investors or terminations of our servicing engagements will decrease these fees. HUD has the right to terminate Berkeley Point\u2019s current servicing engagements for cause. In addition to termination for cause, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may terminate Berkeley Point\u2019s servicing engagements without cause by paying a termination fee. Institutional investors typically may terminate servicing engagements with Berkeley Point at any time with or without cause, without paying a termination fee. We are also subject to losses that may arise from servicing errors, such as a failure to maintain insurance, pay taxes, or provide notices. If we breach our servicing obligations to the agencies or institutional investors, including as a result of a failure to perform by any third parties to which we have contracted certain routine back-office aspects of loan servicing, the servicing engagements may be terminated. Significant declines or terminations of servicing engagements or breaches of such obligations, in the absence of replacement revenue sources, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nReductions in loan servicing fees as a result of defaults or prepayments by borrowers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition to exposure to potential loss sharing, our loan servicing business is also subject to potential reductions in loan servicing fees if the borrower defaults on a loan originated thereby, as the generation of loan servicing fees depends upon the continued receipt and processing of periodic installments of principal, interest and other payments such as amounts held in escrow to pay property taxes and other required expenses. The loss of such loan servicing fees would reduce the amount of cash actually generated from loan servicing and from interest on amounts held in escrow. The expected loss of future loan servicing fees would also result in non-cash impairment charges to earnings. Such cash and non-cash charges could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nReal Estate LP may engage in a broad range of commercial real estate activities, and we will have limited influence over the selection or management of such activities.\nIn the BP Transaction, we acquired approximately 27% of the capital in Real Estate LP. Cantor controls the remaining 73% of its capital and controls the general partner of Real Estate LP, who will manage Real Estate LP. Real Estate LP collaborates with Cantor\u2019s significant existing real estate finance business, and Real Estate LP may conduct activities in any real estate-related business or asset-backed securities-related business or any extensions thereof and ancillary activities thereto. See \u201cItem 13 - Certain Relationships and Related-Party Transactions-BP Transaction Agreement and Real Estate LP Limited Partnership Agreement.\u201d Accordingly, we will have limited to no influence on the selection or management of the activities conducted by Real Estate LP, each of which may have different risks and uncertainty associated with it and that are each beyond our control. See \u201c-Risks Related to Our Relationship with BGC Partners, Cantor and Their Respective Affiliates-We are controlled by BGC Partners (which is controlled by Cantor). Upon completion of the distribution, we will be controlled by Cantor. BGC Partners\u2019 and Cantor\u2019s respective interests may conflict with our interests, and BGC Partners and Cantor may exercise their control in a way that favors their respective interests to our detriment.\u201d\nLiquidity, Funding and Indebtedness\nLiquidity is essential to our business, and insufficient liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. Our liquidity could be impaired due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects our clients, other third parties or us.\nWe are a holding company with no direct operations. We conduct substantially all of our operations through our operating subsidiaries. We do not have any material assets other than our direct and indirect ownership in the equity of our subsidiaries. As a result, our operating cash flow is dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries. In addition, we are dependent on the distribution of earnings, loans or other payments by our subsidiaries to us. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or similar proceeding with respect to any of our subsidiaries, we, as an equity owner of such subsidiary, and therefore holders of our securities, including our Class A common stock, will be subject to the prior claims of such subsidiary\u2019s creditors, including trade creditors, and any preferred equity holders. Any dividends declared by us, any payment by us of our indebtedness or other expenses, and all applicable taxes payable in respect of our net taxable income, if any, are paid from cash on hand and funds received from distributions, loans or other payments from Newmark OpCo. Regulatory, tax restrictions or elections, and other legal or contractual restrictions may limit our ability to transfer funds freely from our subsidiaries. These laws, regulations and rules may hinder our ability to access funds that we may need to meet our obligations. Certain debt and security agreements entered into by our subsidiaries contain or may contain various restrictions, including restrictions on payments by our subsidiaries to us and the transfer by our subsidiaries of assets pledged as collateral. To the extent that we need funds to pay dividends, repay indebtedness and meet other expenses, or to pay taxes on our share of Newmark OpCo\u2019s net taxable income, and Newmark OpCo or its subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions under applicable law, regulations, or agreements, or are otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, including our ability to raise additional funding, including through access to the debt and equity capital markets.\nOur ability to raise funding in the long-term or short-term debt capital markets or the equity capital markets, or to access secured lending markets could in the future be adversely affected by conditions in the United States and international economy and markets, with the cost and availability of funding adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads and changes in interest rates. To the extent we are not able to access the debt capital markets on acceptable terms in the future, we may seek to raise funding and capital through equity issuances or other means.\nTurbulence in the U.S. and international economy and markets may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the willingness of certain clients to do business with each other or with us. Acquisitions and financial reporting obligations related thereto may impact our ability to access capital markets on a timely basis and may necessitate greater short-term borrowing in the interim, which in turn may adversely affect the interest rates on our debt and our credit ratings and associated outlooks.\nWe generally have had limited need for short-term unsecured funding. We may, however, have need to access short-term capital sources in order to meet business needs from time to time, including financing acquisitions, conducting operations or hiring or retaining real estate brokers, salespeople, managers and other professionals. Our inability to secure such short-term capital could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe require a significant amount of short-term funding capacity for loans we originate through Berkeley Point. As of December 31, 2017, Berkeley Point had $950 million of committed loan funding available through three commercial banks and an uncommitted $325 million Fannie Mae loan repurchase facility. Consistent with industry practice, Berkeley Point\u2019s existing warehouse facilities are short-term, requiring annual renewal. If any of the committed facilities are terminated or are not renewed or the uncommitted facility is not honored, we would be required to obtain replacement financing, which we may be unable to find on favorable terms, or at all, and, in such event, we might not be able to originate loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe are subject to the risk of failed loan deliveries, and even after a successful closing and delivery, may be required to repurchase the loan or to indemnify the investor if there is a breach of a representation or warranty made by us in connection with the sale of loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe bear the risk that a borrower will not close on a loan that has been pre-sold to an investor and the amount of such borrower\u2019s rate lock deposit and any amounts recoverable from such borrower for breach of its obligations are insufficient to cover the investor\u2019s losses. In addition, the investor may choose not to take delivery of the loan if a catastrophic change in the condition of a property occurs after we fund the loan and prior to the investor purchase date. We also have the risk of errors in loan documentation which prevent timely delivery of the loan prior to the investor purchase date. A complete failure to deliver a loan could be a default under the warehouse line used to finance the loan. No assurance can be given that we will not experience failed deliveries in the future or that any losses will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nWe must make certain representations and warranties concerning each loan we originate for the GSEs\u2019 and HUD\u2019s programs or securitizations. The representations and warranties relate to our practices in the origination and servicing of the loans and the accuracy of the information being provided by it. In the event of a material breach of representations or warranties concerning a loan, even if the loan is not in default, investors could, among other things, require us to repurchase the full amount of the loan and seek indemnification for losses from it, or, for Fannie Mae DUS loans, increase the level of risk-sharing on the loan. Our obligation to repurchase the loan is independent of our risk-sharing obligations. Our ability to recover on a claim against the borrower or any other party may be contractually limited and would also be dependent, in part, upon the financial condition and liquidity of such party. Although these obligations have not had a significant impact on our results to date, significant repurchase or indemnification obligations imposed on us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe have debt, which could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and activities, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or the commercial real estate services industry, expose us to interest rate risk and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $1,123.2 million in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding. The remaining balance of $270.7 million under the Term Loan was repaid in full subsequent to December 31, 2017. On March 19, 2018, Newmark borrowed $150.0 million from BGC pursuant to the existing Intercompany Credit Agreement. The amount of debt we incur may have important, adverse consequences to us and our investors, including that:\n\u2022\nit may limit our ability to borrow money, dispose of assets or sell equity to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments, debt service, strategic initiatives or other obligations or purposes;\n\u2022\nit may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the economy, the markets, regulatory requirements, our operations or our business;\n\u2022\nwe may be more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022\nit may make us more vulnerable to downturns in the economy or our business;\n\u2022\nit may require a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest payments;\n\u2022\nit may make it more difficult for us to satisfy other obligations;\n\u2022\nit may increase the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of us, which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase common stock; and\n\u2022\nthere would be a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects if we were unable to service our indebtedness or obtain additional financing or refinance our existing debt on terms acceptable to us.\nTo the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above could increase. In addition, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to service our outstanding debt or to repay the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to service or refinance our debt.\nWe may incur substantially more debt or take other actions which would intensify the risks discussed herein.\nWe may incur substantial additional debt in the future, some of which may be secured debt. Under the terms of our existing debt, we are permitted under certain circumstances to incur additional debt, grant liens on our assets to secure existing or future debt, recapitalize our debt or take a number of other actions that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on our debt when due. To the extent that we borrow additional funds, the terms of such borrowings may contain more stringent financial covenants, change of control provisions, make-whole provisions or other terms that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nThe Term Loan Credit Agreement and the Revolving Credit Agreement, each as amended, contain covenants that could impose operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things and subject to certain exceptions:\n\u2022\ncreate liens on certain assets;\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\nmake significant investments and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets;\n\u2022\npay additional dividends on or make additional distributions in respect of our capital stock or make restricted payments;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and\n\u2022\nplace restrictions on certain distributions from subsidiaries.\nIndebtedness that we may enter into in the future, if any, could also potentially contain similar or additional covenants or restrictions. Any of these restrictions could limit our ability to adequately plan for or react to market conditions and could otherwise restrict certain of our corporate activities. Any material failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the Term Loan Credit Agreement or the Revolving Credit Agreement, each as amended, as well as instruments governing our future indebtedness. Upon a material default, unless such default were cured by us or waived by lenders in accordance with the applicable agreements, the lenders under such agreements could elect to invoke various remedies under the agreements, including potentially accelerating the payment of unpaid principal and interest, terminating their commitments or, however unlikely, potentially forcing us into bankruptcy or liquidation. In addition, a default or acceleration under any of such agreements could trigger a cross default under the other agreements, including potential future debt arrangements. As long as we are a subsidiary of BGC Partners, we will remain subject to restrictions under the Revolving Credit Agreement even if we have no outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Agreement. Although we believe that our operating results will be more than sufficient to cover all of these obligations, including potential future indebtedness, no assurance can be given that our operating results will be sufficient to service our indebtedness or to fund all of our other expenditures or to obtain additional or replacement financing on a timely basis and on reasonable terms in order to meet these requirements when due.\nCredit rating downgrades or defaults by us could adversely affect us.\nThe credit ratings and associated outlooks of companies may be critical to their reputation and operational and financial success. A company\u2019s credit ratings and associated outlooks are influenced by a number of factors, including: operating environment, earnings and profitability trends, the prudence of funding and liquidity management practices, balance sheet size/composition and resulting leverage, cash flow coverage of interest, composition and size of the capital base, available liquidity, outstanding borrowing levels, the company\u2019s competitive position in the industry and its relationships in the industry. A credit rating and/or the associated outlook can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances of that company or related companies warrant such a change. Any adverse ratings or reduction in the credit ratings of Newmark, BGC Partners, Cantor or any of their other affiliates, and/or the associated outlook could adversely affect the availability of debt financing to us on acceptable terms, as well as the cost and other terms upon which we may obtain any such financing. In addition, credit ratings and associated outlooks may be important to clients in certain markets and in certain transactions. A company\u2019s contractual counterparties may, in certain circumstances, demand collateral in the event of a credit ratings or outlook downgrade of that company.\nOur acquisitions may require significant cash resources and may lead to a significant increase in the level of our indebtedness.\nPotential future acquisitions may lead to a significant increase in the level of our indebtedness. We may enter into short- or long-term financing arrangements in connection with acquisitions which may occur from time to time. In addition, we may incur substantial nonrecurring transaction costs, including break-up fees, assumption\nof liabilities and expenses and compensation expenses and we would likely incur similar expenses. The increased level of our consolidated indebtedness in connection with potential acquisitions may restrict our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms, and such leverage, and any resulting liquidity or credit issues, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may not be able to realize the full value of the Nasdaq payment, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOn June 28, 2013, BGC Partners sold eSpeed to Nasdaq in the Nasdaq Transaction. The total consideration paid or payable by Nasdaq in the Nasdaq Transaction included an earn-out of up to 14,883,705 shares of common stock of Nasdaq to be paid ratably over 15 years after the closing of the Nasdaq Transaction, provided that Nasdaq produces at least $25 million in gross revenues for the applicable year. As of December 31, 2017, up to 9,922,470 Nasdaq shares remained payable by Nasdaq under this earn-out. In connection with the separation prior to the completion of our IPO, BGC transferred to Newmark the right to receive the remainder of the Nasdaq payment. We recognized the receipt of the first of these payments of Nasdaq shares in the quarter ended September 30, 2017, and expect to recognize the receipt of shares ratably in the third quarter of future fiscal years. This earn-out presents market risk to us as the value of consideration related to the Nasdaq payment is subject to fluctuations based on the stock price of Nasdaq common stock. Therefore, if Nasdaq were to experience financial difficulties or a significant downturn, the value of the Nasdaq payment may decline and we may receive fewer or no additional Nasdaq shares pursuant to this earn-out, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR CORPORATE AND PARTNERSHIP STRUCTURE\nWe are a holding company, and accordingly we are dependent upon distributions from Newmark OpCo to pay dividends, taxes and indebtedness and other expenses and to make repurchases.\nWe are a holding company with no direct operations, and we will be able to pay dividends, taxes and other expenses, and to make repurchases of shares of our Class A common stock and purchases of Newmark Holdings limited partnership interests or other equity interests in our subsidiaries, only from our available cash on hand and funds received from distributions, loans or other payments from Newmark OpCo. Tax restrictions or elections and other legal or contractual restrictions may limit our ability to transfer funds freely from our subsidiaries. In addition, any unanticipated accounting, tax or other charges against net income could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends and to make repurchases.\nIn March 2018, our board of directors and audit committee authorized repurchases of shares of our Class A common stock and redemptions or repurchases of limited partnership interests or other equity interests in our subsidiaries up to $100 million. This authorization includes repurchases of stock or units from executive officers, other employees and partners, including of BGC and Cantor, as well as other affiliated persons or entities. From time to time, we may repurchase shares or redeem or repurchase units. See-Liquidity, Funding and Indebtedness \u201c-Liquidity is essential to our business, and insufficient liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\u201d\nWe may not pay a dividend and may not pay the same dividend paid by Newmark OpCo to its equity holders.\nWe currently intend to pay dividends on a quarterly basis. Our ability to pay dividends is dependent upon our available cash on hand and funds received from distributions, loans or other payments from Newmark OpCo. Newmark OpCo intends to distribute to its limited partners, including us, on a pro rata and quarterly basis, cash in an amount that will be determined by Newmark Holdings, its general partner, of which we are the general partner. Newmark OpCo\u2019s ability, and in turn our ability, to make such distributions will depend upon the continuing profitability and strategic and operating needs of our business. We may not pay the same dividend to our shares as the dividend paid by Newmark OpCo to its limited partners.\nWe may also repurchase shares of our common stock or purchase Newmark Holdings limited partnership interests or other equity interests in our subsidiaries, including from BGC Partners, Cantor or our executive\nofficers, other employees, partners and others, or cease to make such repurchases or purchases, from time to time. In addition, from time to time, we may reinvest all or a portion of the distributions we receive in Newmark OpCo\u2019s business. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that future dividends will be paid or that dividend amounts will be maintained at current or future levels. See \u201cItem 5 - Market for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities-Dividend Policy.\u201d\nBecause our voting control is concentrated among the holders of our Class B common stock, the market price of our Class A common stock may be materially adversely affected by its disparate voting rights.\nThe holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock have substantially identical economic rights, but their voting rights are different. Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share, while holders of Class B common stock are entitled to 10 votes per share on all matters to be voted on by stockholders in general.\nAs of December 31, 2017, BGC Partners held 115,593,786 shares of our Class A common stock which represented approximately 83.4% of our outstanding Class A common stock. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, BGC Partners held 15,840,049 shares of our Class B common stock which represented all of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. Together, the shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock held by BGC Partners as of December 31, 2017 represented approximately 92.3% of our total voting power. Upon the completion of the distribution, Cantor (including CFGM) will beneficially own all of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock, representing approximately 53.3% of our total voting power. In addition, Cantor has the right to exchange exchangeable partnership interests in Newmark Holdings into additional shares of Class A or Class B common stock, and pursuant to the exchange agreement, BGC Partners, Cantor, CFGM and other Cantor affiliates entitled to hold Class B common stock under our certificate of incorporation have the right to exchange from time to time, on a one-to-one basis, subject to adjustment, shares of our Class A common stock now owned or subsequently acquired by such persons for shares of our Class B common stock, up to the number of shares of Class B common stock that are authorized but unissued under our certificate of incorporation. Prior to the distribution, however, without the prior consent of BGC Partners, the Cantor entities may not exchange such shares of our Class A common stock into shares of our Class B common stock. We expect to retain our dual class structure, and there are no circumstances under which the holders of Class B common stock would be required to convert their shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock.\nAs long as BGC Partners or, after the distribution, Cantor, beneficially owns a majority of our total voting power, it will have the ability, without the consent of the other holders of our Class A common stock, to elect all of the members of our board of directors and to control our management and affairs. In addition, it will be able to in its sole discretion determine the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders for approval and will be able to cause or prevent a change of control of us. In certain circumstances, the shares of Class B common stock issued to BGC Partners or, after the distribution, Cantor, may be transferred without conversion to Class A common stock, such as when the shares are transferred to an entity controlled by Cantor, BGC Partners or Mr. Lutnick.\nThe Class B common stock is controlled by BGC Partners or, after the distribution, will be controlled by Cantor, and will not be subject to conversion or redemption by us. Our certificate of incorporation does not provide for automatic conversion of shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock upon the occurrence of any event. Furthermore, the Class B common stock is only issuable to Cantor, Mr. Lutnick or certain persons or entities controlled by them or BGC Partners. The difference in the voting rights of Class B common stock could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock may adversely affect the trading market for our Class A common stock.\nS&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell have recently announced changes to their eligibility criteria for inclusion of shares of public companies on certain indices, including the S&P 500, namely, to exclude companies with\nmultiple classes of shares of common stock from being added to such indices. In addition, several shareholder advisory firms have announced their opposition to the use of multiple class structures. As a result, the dual class structure of our common stock may prevent the inclusion of our Class A common stock in such indices and may cause shareholder advisory firms to publish negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or otherwise seek to cause us to change our capital structure. Any such exclusion from indices could result in a less active trading market for our Class A common stock. Any actions or publications by shareholder advisory firms critical of our corporate governance practices or capital structure could also adversely affect the value of our Class A common stock.\nDelaware law may protect decisions of our board of directors that have a different effect on holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock.\nStockholders may not be able to challenge decisions that have an adverse effect upon holders of our Class A common stock compared to holders of our Class B common stock if our board of directors acts in a disinterested, informed manner with respect to these decisions, in good faith and in the belief that it is acting in the best interests of our stockholders. Delaware law generally provides that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all stockholders, regardless of class or series, and does not have separate or additional duties to different groups of stockholders, subject to applicable provisions set forth in a corporation\u2019s certificate of incorporation and general principles of corporate law and fiduciary duties.\nIf we or Newmark Holdings were deemed an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (which we refer to as the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d), the Investment Company Act\u2019s restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business and structure as contemplated and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nGenerally, an entity is deemed an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act if it is primarily engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities, and is deemed an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act if it owns \u201cinvestment securities\u201d having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We believe that neither we nor Newmark Holdings should be deemed an \u201cinvestment company\u201d as defined under Section 3(a)(1)(A) because neither of us is primarily engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities. Rather, through our operating subsidiaries, we and Newmark Holdings are primarily engaged in the operation of various types of commercial real estate services businesses as described in this prospectus. Neither we nor Newmark Holdings is an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under Section 3(a)(1)(C) because more than 60% of the value of our total assets on an unconsolidated basis are interests in majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves \u201cinvestment companies.\u201d In particular, Berkeley Point, a significant majority-owned subsidiary, is entitled to rely on, among other things, the mortgage banker exemption in Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act.\nTo ensure that we and Newmark Holdings are not deemed \u201cinvestment companies\u201d under the Investment Company Act, we need to be primarily engaged, directly or indirectly, in the non-investment company businesses of our operating subsidiaries. If we were to cease participation in the management of Newmark Holdings, if Newmark Holdings, in turn, were to cease participation in the management of Newmark OpCo, or if Newmark OpCo, in turn, were to cease participation in the management of our operating subsidiaries, that would increase the possibility that we and Newmark Holdings could be deemed \u201cinvestment companies.\u201d Further, if we were deemed not to have a majority of the voting power of Newmark Holdings (including through our ownership of the Special Voting Limited Partnership Interest), if Newmark Holdings, in turn, were deemed not to have a majority of the voting power of Newmark OpCo (including through its ownership of the Special Voting Limited Partnership Interest), or if Newmark OpCo, in turn, were deemed not to have a majority of the voting power of our operating subsidiaries, that would increase the possibility that we and Newmark Holdings could be deemed \u201cinvestment companies.\u201d Finally, if any of our operating subsidiaries were deemed \u201cinvestment companies,\u201d our interests in Newmark Holdings and Newmark OpCo, and Newmark Holdings\u2019 interests in Newmark OpCo, could be deemed \u201cinvestment securities,\u201d and we and Newmark Holdings could be deemed \u201cinvestment companies.\u201d\nWe expect to take all legally permissible action to ensure that we and Newmark Holdings are not deemed investment companies under the Investment Company Act, but no assurance can be given that this will not occur.\nThe Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder contain detailed prescriptions for the organization and operations of investment companies. Among other things, the Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder limit or prohibit transactions with affiliates, limit the issuance of debt and equity securities, prohibit the issuance of stock options and impose certain governance requirements. If anything were to happen that would cause us or Newmark Holdings to be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, the Investment Company Act would limit our or its capital structure, ability to transact business with affiliates (including BGC Partners, Cantor, Newmark Holdings or Newmark OpCo, as the case may be) and ability to compensate key employees. Therefore, if we or Newmark Holdings became subject to the Investment Company Act, it could make it impractical to continue our business in this structure, impair agreements and arrangements and impair the transactions contemplated by those agreements and arrangements, between and among us, Newmark Holdings and Newmark OpCo, or any combination thereof, and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE SEPARATION AND THE DISTRIBUTION\nBecause we closed our IPO on December 19, 2017, we have limited operating history as a separate public company, and our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nOur historical financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of BGC Partners through December 13, 2017. Accordingly, the historical financial information included herein does not necessarily reflect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future primarily as a result of the following factors:\n\u2022\nPrior to the separation, our business has been operated by BGC Partners as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. BGC Partners or one of its affiliates has performed various corporate functions for us, including legal services, treasury, accounting, auditing, risk management, information technology, human resources, corporate affairs, tax administration, certain governance functions (including internal audit and compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) and external reporting. Our historical financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from BGC Partners for these and similar functions. These allocations are likely less than the comparable expenses we believe we would have incurred had we operated as a separate public company.\n\u2022\nUntil the completion of our IPO, our business was integrated with the other businesses of BGC Partners. Historically, we have shared economies of scale in costs, employees and vendor relationships. While we have entered into transitional arrangements that govern certain commercial and other relationships between BGC Partners and us after the separation, those transitional arrangements may not fully capture the benefits our business has enjoyed as a result of being integrated with the other businesses of BGC Partners. The loss of these benefits could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects following the completion of the separation.\n\u2022\nGenerally, our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and capital expenditures, have historically been satisfied as part of the enterprise-wide cash management policies of BGC Partners. We may need to obtain additional financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, strategic relationships or other arrangements.\n\u2022\nThe cost of capital for our business may be higher than BGC Partners\u2019 cost of capital prior to the separation.\nOther significant changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financing and business operations as a result of operating as a public company separate from BGC Partners. The adjustments and allocations we have made in preparing our historical financial statements may not appropriately reflect our operations during those periods as if we had in fact operated as a stand-alone entity, or what the actual effect of our separation from BGC Partners will be. For additional information about the presentation of our historical financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, see \u201cItem 6 - Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and \u201cItem 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nWe may experience increased costs resulting from a decrease in the purchasing power as a result of our recent separation from BGC Partners.\nHistorically, we have been able to take advantage of BGC Partners\u2019 size and purchasing power in procuring goods, technology and services, including insurance, employee benefit support and audit services. As a separate public company, we are a smaller and less diversified company than BGC Partners, and we may not have access to financial and other resources comparable to those available to BGC Partners prior to the IPO. As a separate, stand-alone company, we may be unable to obtain goods, technology and services at prices and on terms as favorable as those available to us prior to the IPO, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe separation may adversely affect our business, and we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation.\nWe may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the separation, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. These benefits include the following:\n\u2022\nimproving strategic planning, increasing management focus and streamlining decision-making by providing the flexibility to implement our strategic plan and to respond more effectively to different client needs and the changing economic environment;\n\u2022\nallowing us to adopt the capital structure, investment policy and dividend policy best suited to our financial profile and business needs, as well as resolving the current competition for capital among BGC Partners\u2019 businesses;\n\u2022\ncreating an independent equity structure that will facilitate our ability to effect future acquisitions utilizing our Class A common stock; and\n\u2022\nfacilitating incentive compensation arrangements for employees more directly tied to the performance of our business, and enhancing employee hiring and retention by, among other things, improving the alignment of management and employee incentives with performance and growth objectives.\nWe may not achieve the anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons. There also can be no assurance that the separation will not adversely affect our business.\nThere is no assurance that the distribution will occur. If the distribution does not occur, our business and common stock may suffer.\nAs of December 31, 2017, BGC Partners held 115,593,786 shares of our Class A common stock representing approximately 83.4% of our outstanding Class A common stock. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, BGC Partners held 15,840,049 shares of our Class B common stock representing all of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. In addition, on March 7, 2018, BGC, including through its subsidiary BGC Partners, L.P., purchased 16,606,726 newly issued exchangeable limited partnership units of Newmark Holdings. BGC Partners has advised us that it currently expects to pursue a distribution to its stockholders of all of the shares of our common stock that it then owns in a manner that is intended to qualify as generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The shares of our common stock that BGC Partners owns are subject to the 180-day\n\u201clock-up\u201d restriction contained in the underwriting agreement for the IPO. Further, there is no assurance that BGC Partners will complete the distribution. The distribution is subject to a number of conditions, and even though BGC Partners may distribute those shares in a tax-efficient manner to the stockholders of BGC Partners, BGC Partners may determine not to proceed with the distribution if the BGC Partners board of directors determines, in its sole discretion, that the distribution is not in the best interest of BGC Partners and its stockholders. Accordingly, the distribution may not occur on the expected timeframe, or at all.\nIf the distribution does not occur, we may not be able to obtain some of the benefits that we expect as a result of the distribution, including greater strategic focus, increased agility and speed and the other benefits. The separation and the distribution will permit us to build a management team that can focus solely on our strategic initiatives and future growth.\nIf, following the completion of the distribution, there is a determination that the distribution is taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes because the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings underlying the tax opinion with respect to the distribution are incorrect or for any other reason, then BGC Partners and its stockholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities, and we could incur significant liabilities.\nIt is a condition to the distribution that BGC Partners receive an opinion of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, outside counsel to BGC Partners, to the effect that the distribution, together with certain related transactions, will qualify as a transaction that is described in Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which we refer to as the \u201cCode\u201d). The opinion will rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from BGC Partners and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, BGC Partners and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel. Moreover, notwithstanding this opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine on audit that the separation or the distribution is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of BGC Partners or us after the separation or distribution. If the separation or distribution is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, BGC Partners and its stockholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities and we may be required to indemnify BGC Partners for all or a portion of any such tax liabilities under the tax matters agreement. Any such liabilities could be substantial, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. For a description of the sharing of such liabilities between BGC Partners and us, see \u201cItem 13 - Certain Relationships and Related-Party Transactions-Tax Matters Agreement.\u201d\nWe may be required to pay Cantor for a significant portion of the tax benefit, if any, relating to any additional tax depreciation or amortization deductions we claim as a result of any step up in the tax basis of the assets of BGC U.S., BGC Global or Newmark OpCo resulting from exchanges of interests in BGC Holdings (together with, prior to the distribution, interests in Newmark Holdings for our common stock.\nCertain partnership interests in BGC Holdings (together with, prior to the distribution, certain interests in Newmark Holdings) may be exchanged for shares of BGC Partners common stock. In the vast majority of cases, the partnership units that become exchangeable for shares of BGC common stock are units that have been granted as compensation, and, therefore, the exchange of such units will not result in an increase in BGC\u2019s share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of BGC U.S., BGC Global and/or Newmark OpCo. However, exchanges of other partnership units-including non-tax-free exchanges of units by Cantor-could result in an increase in the tax basis of such tangible and intangible assets that otherwise would not have been available, although the Internal Revenue Service may challenge all or part of that tax basis increase, and a court could sustain such a challenge by the Internal Revenue Service. These increases in tax basis, if sustained, may reduce the amount of tax that BGC would otherwise be required to pay in the future. In such circumstances, the\ntax receivable agreement that BGC entered into with Cantor provides for the payment by BGC to Cantor of 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in the U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that BGC actually realizes as a result of these increases in tax basis and certain other tax benefits related to its entering into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. It is expected that BGC will benefit from the remaining 15% cash savings, if any, in income tax that we realize.\nWe may not be able to execute transactions that are outside of Treasury Regulations safe harbors.\nUnder current law, a spin-off can be rendered taxable to the parent corporation and its stockholders as a result of certain post-spin-off acquisitions of shares or assets of the spun-off corporation. For example, a spin-off may result in taxable gain to the parent corporation under Section 355(e) of the Code if the spin-off were later deemed to be part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, shares representing a 50% or greater interest (by vote or value) in the spun-off corporation. To preserve the tax-free treatment of the separation and the distribution, and in addition to our other indemnity obligations, the tax matters agreement between us and BGC Partners will restrict us, through the end of the two-year period following the distribution, except in specific circumstances, from: (i) entering into any transaction pursuant to which all or a portion of the shares of our common stock would be acquired, whether by merger or otherwise, (ii) issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds, (iii) repurchasing shares of our common stock other than in certain open-market transactions, and (iv) ceasing to actively conduct certain of our businesses. The tax matters agreement will also prohibit us from taking or failing to take any other action that would prevent the distribution and certain related transactions from qualifying as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. In the absence of the availability of a safe harbor under applicable Treasury Regulations, these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions, equity issuances or repurchases or other transactions that we may believe to be in the best interests of our stockholders or that might increase the value of our business. Current Treasury Regulations allow for a number of safe harbors. For more information, see \u201cItem 13 - Certain Relationships and Related-Party Transactions-Tax Matters Agreement.\u201d\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH BGC PARTNERS, CANTOR AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES\nWe are controlled by BGC Partners (which is controlled by Cantor). Upon completion of the distribution, we will be controlled by Cantor. BGC Partners\u2019 and Cantor\u2019s respective interests may conflict with our interests, and BGC Partners and Cantor may exercise their control in a way that favors their respective interests to our detriment.\nAs of December 31, 2017, BGC Partners held 115,593,786 shares of our Class A common stock which represented approximately 83.4% of our outstanding Class A common stock. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, BGC Partners held 15,840,049 shares of our Class B common stock which represented all of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. Together, the shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock held by BGC Partners as of December 31, 2017 represented approximately 92.3% of our total voting power. BGC Partners is controlled by Cantor. If the distribution occurs, Cantor will beneficially own 6,671,146 shares of our Class A common stock representing approximately 4.8% of our outstanding Class A common stock, and all of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock, together representing approximately 55.6% of our total voting power. Following its March 7, 2018 acquisition of 16,606,726 exchangeable limited partnership units of Newmark Holdings, if BGC were to exchange such units into shares of our Class B common stock, BGC would have 95.0% of our total voting power as of March 7, 2018 (92.7% if BGC were to exchange such units into shares of our Class A common stock). We expect to retain our dual class structure, and there are no circumstances under which the holders of Class B common stock would be required to convert their shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock.\nAs a result, BGC Partners, directly through its ownership of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock, and Cantor, indirectly through its control of BGC Partners, are each able to exercise\ncontrol over our management and affairs and all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of our directors and determinations with respect to acquisitions and dispositions, as well as material expansions or contractions of our business, entry into new lines of business and borrowings and issuances of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock or other securities. BGC Partners\u2019 voting power, prior to the completion of the distribution, and Cantor\u2019s voting power, indirectly prior to the completion of the distribution and directly after the completion of the distribution, may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us.\nBGC Partners\u2019 and Cantor\u2019s ability to exercise control over us could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest. Conflicts of interest may arise between us and each of BGC Partners and Cantor in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships, including:\n\u2022\npotential acquisitions and dispositions of businesses;\n\u2022\nthe issuance or disposition of securities by us;\n\u2022\nthe election of new or additional directors to our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe payment of dividends by us (if any), distribution of profits by Newmark OpCo and/or Newmark Holdings and repurchases of shares of our Class A common stock or purchases of Newmark Holdings limited partnership interests or other equity interests in our subsidiaries, including from BGC Partners, Cantor or our executive officers, other employees, partners and others;\n\u2022\nbusiness operations or business opportunities of ours and BGC Partners\u2019 or Cantor\u2019s that would compete with the other party\u2019s business opportunities;\n\u2022\nintellectual property matters;\n\u2022\nbusiness combinations involving us; and\n\u2022\nthe nature, quality and pricing of administrative services and transition services to be provided to or by BGC Partners or Cantor or their respective affiliates.\nPotential conflicts of interest could also arise if we decide to enter into any new commercial arrangements with BGC Partners or Cantor in the future or in connection with BGC Partners\u2019 or Cantor\u2019s desire to enter into new commercial arrangements with third parties.\nWe also expect each of BGC Partners and Cantor to manage its respective ownership of us so that it will not be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, including by maintaining its voting power in us above a majority absent an applicable exemption from the Investment Company Act. This may result in conflicts with us, including those relating to acquisitions or offerings by us involving issuances of shares of our Class A common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into shares of Class A common stock, that would dilute BGC Partners\u2019 or Cantor\u2019s voting power in us.\nIn addition, each of BGC Partners and Cantor has from time to time in the past and may in the future consider possible strategic realignments of its own businesses and/or of the relationships that exist between and among BGC Partners and/or Cantor and their other respective affiliates and us. Any future material related-party transaction or arrangement between BGC Partners and/or Cantor and their other respective affiliates and us is subject to the prior approval by our audit committee, but generally does not require the separate approval of our stockholders, and if such stockholder approval is required, BGC Partners and/or Cantor may retain sufficient voting power to provide any such requisite approval without the affirmative consent of our other stockholders. Further, our regulators may require the consolidation, for regulatory purposes, of BGC Partners, Cantor and/or their other respective affiliates and us or require other restructuring of the group. There is no assurance that such consolidation or restructuring would not result in a material expense or disruption to our business.\nCantor has existing real estate-related businesses, and Newmark and Cantor are partners in a real estate-related joint venture, Real Estate LP. While these businesses do not currently compete with Newmark, it is\npossible that, in the future, real estate-related opportunities in which Newmark would be interested may also be pursued by Cantor and/or Real Estate LP, and Real Estate LP may conduct activities in any real estate-related business or asset-backed securities-related business or any extensions thereof and ancillary activities thereto. For example, Cantor\u2019s commercial lending business has historically offered conduit loans to the multifamily market. While conduit loans have certain key differences versus multifamily agency loans, such as those offered by Berkeley Point, there can be no assurance that Cantor\u2019s and/or Real Estate LP\u2019s lending businesses will not seek to offer multifamily loans to our existing and potential multifamily customer base.\nMoreover, the service of officers or partners of BGC Partners or Cantor as our executive officers and directors, and those persons\u2019 ownership interests in and payments from BGC Partners or Cantor and their respective affiliates, could create conflicts of interest when we and those directors or executive officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and them.\nWe also have entered into agreements that provide certain rights to the holder of a majority of the Newmark Holdings exchangeable limited partnership interest, which is currently Cantor. For example, the separation and distribution agreement provides that any quarterly dividend to our common stockholders that is 25% or more of our post-tax Adjusted Earnings per fully diluted share shall require the consent of the holder of a majority of the Newmark Holdings exchangeable limited partnership interests. In addition, the separation and distribution agreement requires Newmark to contribute any reinvestment cash (i.e., any cash that Newmark retains, after the payment of taxes, as a result of distributing a smaller percentage than Newmark Holdings from the distributions they receive from Newmark OpCo), as an additional capital contribution with respect to its existing limited partnership interest in Newmark OpCo, unless Newmark and the holder of a majority of the Newmark Holdings exchangeable limited partnership interests agree otherwise. See \u201cItem 13 - Certain Relationships and Related-Party Transactions-Adjustment to Exchange Ratio\u201d and \u201cItem 13 - Certain Relationships and Related-Party Transactions-Use of Reinvestment Cash.\u201d It is possible that Cantor, as the holder of a majority of the Newmark Holdings exchangeable limited partnership interest, will not agree to a higher dividend percentage or a different use of reinvestment cash, even if doing so might be more advantageous to the Newmark stockholders.\nOur agreements and other arrangements with BGC Partners and Cantor, including the separation and distribution agreement, may be amended upon agreement of the parties to those agreements and approval of our audit committee. During the time that we are controlled by BGC Partners and/or Cantor, BGC Partners and/or Cantor may be able to require us to agree to amendments to these agreements. We may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts, and, even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party. Additionally, pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, for so long as BGC Partners beneficially owns at least 50% of the total voting power of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote in the election of directors, we will not, and will cause our subsidiaries to not (without BGC Partners\u2019 prior written consent) take certain actions, including, without limitation, acquiring any other businesses or assets or disposing of any of our assets, in each case with an aggregate value for all such transactions in excess of $100 million, or incurring any indebtedness, other than indebtedness not in excess of $50 million in the aggregate or any indebtedness some or all of the proceeds of which are used to repay the Term Loan, the Converted Term Loan or the BGC Notes. See \u201cItem 13 - Certain Relationships and Related-Party Transactions-Separation and Distribution Agreement-Operating Covenants.\u201d\nIn order to address potential conflicts of interest between or among BGC Partners, Cantor and their respective representatives and us, our certificate of incorporation will contain provisions regulating and defining the conduct of our affairs as they may involve BGC Partners and/or Cantor and their respective representatives, and our powers, rights, duties and liabilities and those of our representatives in connection therewith. Our certificate of incorporation provides that, to the greatest extent permitted by law, no Cantor Company or BGC Partners Company, each as defined in our certificate of incorporation, or any of the representatives, as defined in our certificate of incorporation, of a Cantor Company or BGC Partners Company will, in its capacity as our stockholder or affiliate, owe or be liable for breach of any fiduciary duty to us or any of our stockholders. In addition, to the greatest extent permitted by law, none of any Cantor Company, BGC Partners Company or any of\ntheir respective representatives will owe any duty to refrain from engaging in the same or similar activities or lines of business as us or our representatives or doing business with any of our or our representatives\u2019 clients or customers. If any Cantor Company, BGC Partners Company or any of their respective representatives acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter that may be a corporate opportunity (as defined in our certificate of incorporation) for any such person, on the one hand, and us or any of our representatives, on the other hand, such person will have no duty to communicate or offer such corporate opportunity to us or any of our representatives, and will not be liable to us, any of our stockholders or any of our representatives for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that they pursue or acquire such corporate opportunity for themselves, direct such corporate opportunity to another person or do not present such corporate opportunity to us or any of our representatives, subject to the requirement described in the following sentence. If a third party presents a corporate opportunity to a person who is both our representative and a representative of a BGC Partners Company and/or a Cantor Company, expressly and solely in such person\u2019s capacity as our representative, and such person acts in good faith in a manner consistent with the policy that such corporate opportunity belongs to us, then such person will be deemed to have fully satisfied and fulfilled any fiduciary duty that such person has to us as our representative with respect to such corporate opportunity, provided that any BGC Partners Company, any Cantor Company or any of their respective representatives may pursue such corporate opportunity if we decide not to pursue such corporate opportunity.\nThe corporate opportunity policy that is included in our certificate of incorporation is designed to resolve potential conflicts of interest between us and our representatives and BGC Partners, Cantor and their respective representatives. The Newmark Holdings limited partnership agreement contains similar provisions with respect to us and/or BGC Partners and Cantor and each of our respective representatives, and the Newmark OpCo limited partnership agreement will contain similar provisions with respect to us and/or Newmark Holdings and each of our respective representatives. This policy, however, could make it easier for BGC Partners or Cantor to compete with us. If BGC Partners or Cantor competes with us, it could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nSee \u201cItem 13 - Certain Relationships and Related-Party Transactions-Potential Conflicts of Interest and Competition with BGC Partners and Cantor.\u201d\nMr. Lutnick has actual or potential conflicts of interest because of his positions with BGC Partners and/or Cantor.\nMr. Lutnick serves as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of BGC Partners, as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Cantor, and holds offices at various other affiliates of Cantor. In addition, Mr. Lutnick owns BGC Partners common stock, options to purchase BGC Partners common stock, other BGC Partners\u2019 equity awards or partnership interests in BGC Holdings, or equity interests in Cantor. These interests may be significant compared to his total assets. His positions at BGC Partners and/or Cantor and the ownership of any such equity or equity awards create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when he is faced with decisions that could have different implications for BGC Partners or Cantor than the decisions have for us.\nAgreements between us and BGC Partners and/or Cantor are between related parties, and the terms of these agreements may be less favorable to us than those that we could negotiate with third parties and may subject us to litigation.\nOur relationship with BGC Partners and/or Cantor may result in agreements with BGC Partners and/or Cantor that are between related parties. For example, we provide to and receive from Cantor and BGC Partners and their respective affiliates various administrative services and transition services, respectively. As a result, the prices charged to us or by us for services provided under agreements with BGC Partners and Cantor may be higher or lower than prices that may be charged by third parties, and the terms of these agreements may be less favorable to us than those that we could have negotiated with third parties. Any future material related-party transaction or arrangement between us and BGC Partners and/or Cantor is subject to the prior approval by our\naudit committee, but generally does not require the separate approval of our stockholders, and if such stockholder approval were required, BGC Partners and/or Cantor may retain sufficient voting power to provide any such requisite approval without the affirmative consent of our other stockholders. These related-party relationships may also from time to time subject us to litigation.\nWe are controlled by BGC Partners, which is controlled by Cantor. Cantor controls its wholly owned subsidiary, CF&Co, which was an underwriter of our IPO and may provide us with additional investment banking services. From time to time, in addition, Cantor, CF&Co and their affiliates may provide us with advice and services from time to time.\nWe are controlled by BGC Partners, which is controlled by Cantor. Cantor, in turn, controls its wholly owned subsidiary, CF&Co, which was an underwriter of our IPO. Pursuant to the underwriting agreement, we paid CF&Co 5.5% of the gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our Class A common stock in connection with the IPO. In addition, Cantor, CF&Co and their affiliates may provide investment banking services to us and our affiliates, including acting as our financial advisor in connection with business combinations, dispositions or other transactions, and placing or recommending to us various investments, stock loans or cash management vehicles. They would receive customary fees and commissions for these services. They may also receive brokerage and market data and analytics products and services from us and our respective affiliates.\nWe could be affected by threats, demands, actions or lawsuits from third parties or governmental authorities, including those against Cantor or BGC Partners, for matters that occurred prior to the IPO.\nFrom time to time in the ordinary course of business, we have in the past and may in the future be affected by threats, demands, actions, subpoenas, or legal actions and/or proceedings commenced or threatened against Cantor or BGC Partners for matters that occurred prior to the IPO, when Newmark was a reporting segment of BGC Partners.\nWhile not directly related to Newmark or its real estate business, for example, we learned from Cantor that a former manager in Cantor\u2019s tax department, who was employed for only five months before being terminated in October 2016, had in October 2017 made allegations that BGC Partners overstated its non-GAAP post-tax distributable earnings measure. The employee sought money from Cantor. Cantor, BGC Partners and the Company each respectively undertook a review of these matters, which were assisted by external counsel. Based on these reviews, Cantor and BGC Partners have advised the Company that they believe the allegations of wrongdoing made by the former employee were false, inaccurate and without merit. While none of the claims were directed at the Company, there can be no assurance that the Company will not be subject to similar or different such threats, letters or demands and the costs of investigations, counsel and other advisers in the future.\nRISKS RELATED TO, OWNERSHIP OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK AND OUR STATUS AS A PUBLIC COMPANY\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of an investment in our Class A common stock to decline.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u2022\ndifferences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;\n\u2022\nchanges in analysts\u2019 recommendations or estimates or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022\nthe prospects of our competition and of the commercial real estate market in general;\n\u2022\nchanges in general valuations for companies in our industry; and\n\u2022\nchanges in business, legal or regulatory conditions, or other general economic or market conditions and overall market fluctuations.\nIn particular, the realization of any of the risks described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d or under \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d could have a material adverse impact on the market price of our Class A common stock in the future and cause the value of an investment in our Class A common stock to decline. In addition, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These types of broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nIn the past, stockholders of other companies have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against issuers following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. Any similar litigation against us could result in substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention and our other resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. There is no assurance that such a suit will not be brought against us.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We also incur costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and related rules implemented or to be implemented by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (which we refer to as the \u201cSEC\u201d) and the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC. Prior to the completion of our IPO, these costs have been incurred by BGC Partners on a consolidated basis. The expenses incurred by public companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. We expect the rules and regulations associated with being a public company to result in substantial legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly, although we are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept constraints on policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as our executive officers and may divert management\u2019s attention.\nIf we fail to implement and maintain an effective internal control environment, our operations, reputation and stock price could suffer, we may need to restate our financial statements and we may be delayed in or prevented from accessing the capital markets.\nAs a public company, we are required, under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the first\nfull fiscal year beginning after the effective date of the IPO. This assessment is required to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. To achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period, we will be engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging.\nInternal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, internal controls over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the internal controls. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As such, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and stock price.\nOur ability to identify and remediate any material weaknesses in our internal controls could affect our ability to prepare financial reports in a timely manner, control our policies, procedures, operations and assets, assess and manage our operational, regulatory and financial risks, and integrate our acquired businesses. Similarly, we need to effectively manage any growth that we achieve in such a way as to ensure continuing compliance with all applicable internal control, financial reporting and legal and regulatory requirements. Any failures to ensure full compliance with internal control and financial reporting requirements could result in restatement, delay or prevent us from accessing the capital markets and harm our reputation and the market price for our Class A common stock.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NASDAQ Stock Market rules and we qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. We do not currently expect or intend to rely on any of these exemptions, but there is no assurance that we will not rely on these exemptions in the future.\nBecause BGC Partners controls more than a majority of the total voting power of our common stock, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NASDAQ Stock Market rules. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by another person or group of persons acting together is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain stock exchange rules regarding corporate governance, including:\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that its director nominees be selected or recommended for the board\u2019s selection by a majority of the board\u2019s independent directors in a vote in which only independent directors participate or by a nominating committee comprised solely of independent directors, in either case, with a formal written charter or board resolutions, as applicable, addressing the nominations process and such related matters as may be required under the federal securities laws; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement that its compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities.\nWe do not currently expect or intend to rely on any of these exemptions, but there is no assurance that we will not rely on these exemptions in the future. If we were to utilize some or all of these exemptions, an investor in our Class A Common Stock may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NASDAQ Stock Market rules regarding corporate governance.\nFuture sales of shares of Class A common stock, could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock. Our stockholders could be diluted by such future sales and be further diluted upon exchange of Newmark Holdings limited partnership interests into our common stock and upon issuance of additional Newmark OpCo limited partnership interests to Newmark Holdings as a result of future issuances of Newmark Holdings limited partnership interests.\nFuture sales of our shares could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock. If our existing stockholders sell a large number of shares, or if we issue a large number of shares of our common stock in connection with future acquisitions, strategic alliances, third-party investments and private placements or otherwise, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline significantly. Moreover, the perception in the public market that these stockholders might sell shares could depress the market price of our Class A common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2017, BGC Partners held 115,593,786 shares of our Class A common stock, representing approximately 83.4% of our outstanding Class A common stock. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, BGC Partners held 15,840,049 shares of our Class B common stock representing all of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. Together, the shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock held by BGC Partners represent approximately 92.3% of our total voting power as of December 31, 2017. Following its March 7, 2018 acquisition of 16,606,726 exchangeable limited partnership units of Newmark Holdings, if BGC group were to exchange such units into shares of our Class B common stock, BGC would have 95.0% of our total voting power as of March 7, 2018 (92.7% if BGC were to exchange such units into shares of our Class A common stock).\nBGC Partners has advised us that it currently expects to pursue a distribution to its stockholders of all of the shares of our common stock that it then owns in a manner that is intended to qualify as generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The determination of whether, when and how to proceed with any such distribution is entirely within the discretion of BGC Partners. The shares of our common stock that BGC Partners and our executive officers and directors own are subject to the 180-day \u201clock-up\u201d restriction contained in the underwriting agreement for our IPO. If the distribution occurs, the distributed shares of Class A common stock would be eligible for immediate resale in the public market, except for those held by Cantor and other affiliates of ours, which distributed shares could be sold pursuant to a registered offering or pursuant to an exemption under the Securities Act. We are unable to predict whether significant amounts of our Class A common stock will be sold in the open market in anticipation of, or following, the distribution. Any potential sale, disposition or distribution of our Class A common stock, or the perception that such sale, disposition or distribution could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Class A common stock.\nEven if BGC Partners does not distribute the shares of our common stock that it owns by means of the distribution, BGC Partners may sell all or a portion of such shares to the public or in one or more private transactions after the expiration of the \u201clock-up\u201d restriction on June 13, 2018. We have entered into a registration rights agreement with BGC Partners and Cantor that grants them registration rights to facilitate their sale of shares of our Class A common stock in the market. Any sale or distribution, or expectations in the market of a possible sale or distribution, by BGC Partners or Cantor of all or a portion of our shares of Class A common stock through the distribution, in a registered offering, pursuant to an exemption under the Securities Act or otherwise could depress or reduce the market price for our Class A common stock or cause our shares to trade below the prices at which they would otherwise trade.\nMoreover, the shares of our Class A common stock sold in our IPO are freely tradable without restriction, except for any shares acquired by an affiliate of ours, which shares can be sold under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, subject to various volume and other limitations. Subject to certain limited exceptions, we, our executive officers and directors and BGC Partners have agreed with the underwriters not to directly or indirectly sell, dispose of or hedge any shares of our Class A common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our Class A common stock without the prior written consent of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and\nMerrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated for the period ending on June 13, 2018. After the expiration of the 180-day \u201clock-up\u201d restriction, our executive officers and directors and BGC Partners could dispose of all or any part of their shares of our Class A common stock through a public offering, sales under Rule 144 or other transactions. In addition, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated may, in their sole discretion, release all or some portion of the shares subject to lock-up agreements at any time and for any reason. Sales of a substantial number of such shares upon expiration of the lock-up restriction and market stand-off agreements, the perception that such sales may occur, or early release of these agreements, could cause our market price to fall or make it more difficult for you to sell your Class A common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate.\nWe have registered under the Securities Act 50 million of 400 million shares of Class A common stock which are reserved for issuance upon exercise of options, restricted stock and other equity awards granted under our Long-Term Incentive Plan (which we refer to as the \u201cEquity Plan\u201d) and expect to register the balance from time to time in the future. These shares can be sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to restrictions under the securities laws applicable to resales by affiliates. We may in the future register additional shares of Class A common stock under the Securities Act that become reserved for issuance under other equity incentive plans.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2017, there were outstanding 76,431,000 limited partnership interests of Newmark Holdings. Some of those limited partnership interests will be exchangeable with us for shares of our common stock based on the exchange ratio (which is currently one, but is subject to adjustment as set forth in the separation and distribution agreement). See \u201cItem 13 - Certain Relationships and Related-Party Transactions-Adjustment to Exchange Ratio.\u201d Prior to the distribution, however, such exchanges are subject to the limitation as described below under \u201cItem 13 - Certain Relationships and Related-Party Transactions-Amended and Restated Newmark Holdings Limited Partnership Agreement-Exchanges.\u201d Shares of Class A common stock issued upon such exchange would be eligible for resale in the public market. See \u201cItem 13 - Certain Relationships and Related-Party Transactions-Amended and Restated Newmark Holdings Limited Partnership Agreement-Exchanges.\u201d\nWe may register for resale the shares of our Class A common stock for which the Newmark Holdings limited partnership interests are exchangeable. In light of the number of shares of our common stock issuable in connection with the full exchange of the Newmark Holdings exchangeable limited partnership interests, the price of our Class A common stock may decrease and our ability to raise capital through the issuance of equity securities may be adversely impacted as these exchanges occur and any transfer restrictions lapse.\nPrior to the distribution, to the extent that BGC Partners receives any Newmark OpCo units as a result of any exchange of Newmark Holdings exchangeable limited partnership interests or as a result of any contribution by BGC Partners to Newmark OpCo or purchase by BGC Partners of Newmark OpCo units, then, in each case, BGC Partners will contribute such Newmark OpCo units to Newmark in exchange for an equal number of newly issued shares of Newmark common stock, which would dilute the other stockholders of Newmark. See \u201cItem 13 - Certain Relationships and Related-Party Transactions-Separation and Distribution Agreement-BGC Partners Contribution of Newmark OpCo Units Prior to the Distribution.\u201d\nAny such potential sale, disposition or distribution of our common stock, or the perception that such sale, disposition or distribution could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Class A common stock.\nDelaware law, our corporate organizational documents and other requirements may impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, which could deprive our investors of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (which we refer to as the \u201cDGCL\u201d), our certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws (which\nwe refer to as our \u201cbylaws\u201d) impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our Class A stockholders.\nThese provisions, summarized below, may discourage coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions may also encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with our board of directors. We believe that the benefits of increased protection give us the potential ability to negotiate with the initiator of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us and outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging those proposals because negotiation of them could result in an improvement of their terms.\nOur bylaws will provide that special meetings of stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of our board of directors, or in the event the Chairman of our board of directors is unavailable, by the Chief Executive Officer or by the holders of a majority of the voting power of our Class B common stock, which will be held by BGC Partners before the distribution and by Cantor and CFGM after the distribution. In addition, our certificate of incorporation will permit us to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock.\nOur bylaws will require advance written notice prior to a meeting of our stockholders of a proposal or director nomination which a stockholder desires to present at such a meeting, which generally must be received by our Secretary not later than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of our proxy statement for the preceding year\u2019s annual meeting. In the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not later than the close of business on the later of the 120th day prior to the date of such proxy statement or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by us. Our bylaws will provide that all amendments to our bylaws must be approved by either the holders of a majority of the voting power of all of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote or by a majority of our board of directors.\nWe have elected in our certificate of incorporation not to be subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which generally prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination, such as a merger, with a person or group owning 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s voting stock, for a period of three years following the date on which the person became an interested stockholder, unless (with certain exceptions) the business combination or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder is approved in accordance with Section 203. Accordingly, we are not subject to the anti-takeover effects of Section 203. However, our certificate of incorporation contains provisions that have the same effect as Section 203, except that they provide that each of the Qualified Class B Holders and certain of their direct transferees will not be deemed to be \u201cinterested stockholders,\u201d and accordingly will not be subject to such restrictions.\nFurther, our Equity Plan contains provisions pursuant to which grants that are unexercisable or unvested may automatically become exercisable or vested as of the date immediately prior to certain change of control events. Additionally, change in control and employment agreements between us and our named executive officers also provide for certain grants, payments and grants of exchangeability in the event of certain change of control events.\nThe foregoing factors, as well as the significant common stock ownership by BGC Partners before the distribution and Cantor after the distribution, including shares of our Class B common stock, and rights to acquire additional such shares, and the provisions of any debt agreements could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential investor from making a tender offer for our Class A common stock that could result in a premium over the market price for shares of Class A common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that a state court located within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent to the selection of an alternative forum, a state court located within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a claim for or based on a breach of duty or obligation owed by any current or former director, officer, employee or agent of ours to us or to our stockholders, including any claim alleging the aiding and abetting of such a breach; any action asserting a claim against us or any current or former director, officer, employee or agent of ours arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws; any action asserting a claim related to or involving us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine; or any action asserting an \u201cinternal corporate claim\u201d as that term is defined in Section 115 of the DGCL. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees and agents. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.", "PERMNO": 17126, "SIC": 6531, "TIC": "NMRK"}
