RISK FACTORS\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks, including those described below, which in turn may affect the value of our securities. In addition, other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, perhaps materially. The\nrisks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and actual results and events may differ substantially from those discussed or highlighted in these forward-looking statements. Before making an investment decision with respect to any of our securities, you should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this annual report. See also \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Business\nUnfavorable general economic conditions have adversely affected our business and potential deterioration in conditions in the U.S. and globally could result in decreased demand for VOIs and our ability to obtain future financing.\nThere have been periods, including from 2008 through 2010, in which our business has been materially adversely affected by unfavorable general economic conditions, including effects of weak domestic and world economies resulting, in part, from the instability of global financial markets and regional economies caused by the recent European debt crisis, high unemployment, a decrease in discretionary spending, a decline in housing and real estate values, limited availability of financing and geopolitical conflicts. Future volatility and disruption in worldwide capital and credit markets and any declines in economic conditions in the U.S., Europe and in other parts of the world could adversely impact our business and results of operations, particularly if the availability of financing for us or for our customers is limited, or if general economic conditions adversely affect our customers' ability to pay amounts owed under our loans to them or for maintenance fees or assessments. If the HOAs and Collection Associations are unable to collect maintenance fees or assessments from our customers, not only would our management fee revenue be adversely affected, but the resorts we manage could fall into disrepair and fail to comply with the quality standards associated with the Diamond Resorts brand, which could decrease customer satisfaction, tarnish our reputation and impair our ability to sell our VOIs.\nOur revenues are highly dependent on the travel industry and declines in or disruptions to the travel industry, such as those caused by adverse economic conditions, terrorism and man-made disasters may adversely affect us.\nA substantial amount of our VOI sales activities occur at the managed resort locations in our network, and the volume of our sales correlates directly with the number of prospective customers who visit these resorts each year. The number of visitors to these resorts depends upon travel industry conditions, on an overall basis and in the specific geographic areas in which our resorts are located. Such conditions may be adversely affected by a variety of factors, such as weather conditions, general travel patterns and the potential impact of natural disasters and crises.\nActual or threatened war, terrorist activity, political unrest or civil strife and other geopolitical uncertainty could have a similar effect. In addition, any increased concern about terrorist acts directed against the U.S. and foreign citizens, transportation facilities and assets, and travelers' fears of exposure to contagious diseases may reduce the number of tourists willing to fly or travel in the future, particularly if new significant terrorist attacks or disease outbreaks occur or are threatened.\nMore generally, the travel industry has been hurt by various events occurring in prior years, including the effects of weak domestic and global economies. A sustained downturn in travel patterns, including as a result of increases in travel expenses such as higher airfares or gasoline prices, could cause a reduction in the number of potential customers who visit the managed resorts in our network. If we experience a substantial decline in visitors to these resorts, our VOI sales would likely decline.\nOur future success depends on our ability to market VOIs successfully and efficiently, including sales to new members, as well as sales of additional points to our existing ownership base.\nWe compete for customers with hotel and resort properties and with other vacation ownership resorts and other vacation options such as cruises. The identification of sales prospects and leads, and the marketing of our products to those leads, are essential to our success. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses associated with marketing programs in advance of closing sales to the leads that we identify. If our lead identification and marketing efforts do not yield enough leads or we are unable to successfully convert sales leads to a sufficient number of sales, our growth, including from our efforts to expand Club revenue, and our overall financial performance may be adversely affected. Recently, we have expanded our use of hospitality-focused marketing methods, such as enhanced mini-vacation packages focused on small groups of potential customers. These marketing methods are more expensive and require a greater commitment of resources than traditional marketing activities, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in continuing to expand these efforts.\nIn addition, a significant portion of our sales are additional points purchased by existing members who previously purchased points from us, and our results of operations depend in part on our ability to continue making sales to these members. Our recent rate of sales of additional points to existing owners who previously purchased points from us may not be sustainable in future periods. Furthermore, we do not receive all of the same benefits from sales of additional points to these existing members as we do from sales of points to new members, such as new Club members paying the associated fees and to whom\nwe can offer services, activities and upgrade opportunities and an expanded ownership base to which we can potentially sell additional points.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain an optimal level of points or intervals in inventory for sales to customers.\nOur ability to maintain an optimal level of points or intervals in inventory for sale to customers is dependent on a number of factors, including fluctuations in our sales levels and the amount of inventory recovered through consumer loan and association fee defaults.\nIf we experience a significant decline in our inventory of points available for sale, we may be required to expend more capital to acquire or build inventory.\nWe have entered into inventory recovery agreements with substantially all of the Diamond Collections and HOAs for our managed resorts in North America, together with similar arrangements with the European Collections and a majority of our European managed resorts. Pursuant to these agreements and arrangements, we have the option to recapture VOIs either in the form of points or intervals, and bring them into our inventory for sale to customers. During each of the past six years, approximately 2% to 5% of the outstanding points or intervals were recovered by us pursuant to these agreements. We need to maintain such level of recovery to provide us with our relatively low-cost inventory of VOIs for sales to our customers. However, the volume of points or intervals recovered by us could decline in the future for a variety of reasons, including as a result of termination or non-renewal of our inventory recovery agreements. In addition, if a viable VOI resale market were to develop in the future, our members may choose to resell their interests to third parties. Further, in the event applicable state law makes it more difficult to recover points or intervals, it could extend the time required to consummate a recovery or otherwise make it more difficult to consummate such recoveries. An increased level of VOI sales would also reduce our inventory available for sale. If our inventory available for sale were to decline significantly, generally or in a particular Diamond Collection, we may need to make significant capital expenditures to replenish our inventory by purchasing points or intervals or building or acquiring new inventory at existing resorts, including through arrangements with financial sponsors. Alternatively, we would need to substantially reduce the volume of our VOI sales.\nIf the volume of our inventory of points held by us were to significantly increase, our carrying costs with respect to that inventory would increase.\nIf VOI sales levels do not keep pace with inventory recovery levels, the volume of our inventory of points or intervals may become higher than desired. Also, if the amount of customer defaults increases and we repurchase more VOI inventory than desired pursuant to our inventory recovery agreements, our carrying costs will increase due to the maintenance fees on the recovered VOI inventory that we are required to pay.\nOur recent strategic acquisitions have provided us with additional VOI inventory, and potential future acquisitions may include additional inventory. Further, as part of some of our recent acquisitions, we have incurred additional obligations to repurchase defaulted inventory (either by taking back defaulted consumer loans or repurchasing the inventory that collateralizes such loans). We incur carrying costs associated with our VOI inventory, as we are obligated to pay annual maintenance fees and assessments on any VOIs held in inventory, and higher-than-desired VOI inventory levels would result in increases in these carrying costs. If our inventory available for sale were to increase significantly, we may need to sell some of this excess inventory at significantly discounted prices. In addition, the inventory recovery agreements we enter into with the HOAs and Diamond Collections are subject to annual renewal, and as a result, we may not always repurchase VOI inventory from customers in default. If we do not repurchase such inventory, the annual maintenance fees and assessments are allocated among the remaining non-defaulting owners of units in the HOA and the Diamond Collection, increasing the amounts paid by each of those owners (including us, to the extent we hold units in inventory). This increases the risk that owners of such other units may be unwilling or unable to pay such increased fees and may default as well. The increased per-unit costs could also make units in the HOA and the Diamond Collection less attractive to prospective purchasers.\nA substantial portion of our business is dependent upon contracts with HOAs to manage resort properties and with the Diamond Collections. The expiration, termination or renegotiation of these management contracts could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are party to management contracts relating to 93 properties and the eight Diamond Collections, under which we receive fees for providing management services. We derive a substantial amount of revenue from these contracts, and our hospitality and management services business accounts for a greater percentage of our Adjusted EBITDA than of our total consolidated revenue. Each of the Diamond Resorts managed resorts, other than certain resorts in our European Collection and the Latin America Collection, is typically operated through an HOA, and each of the Diamond Collections is typically operated through a Collection Association. Each of the HOAs and Collection Associations is administered by a board of directors. The\nboards of directors of the HOAs and Collection Associations are responsible for authorizing these management contracts, and negotiate and enforce the terms of these agreements as fiduciaries of their respective resort properties and Diamond Collections. Furthermore, some state regulations impose limitations on the amount of fees that we may charge the HOAs and Diamond Collections for our hospitality management services and the terms of our management contracts. Our management contracts generally have three to ten year terms and are automatically renewable, but provide for early termination rights in certain circumstances. Any of these management contracts may expire at the end of its then-current term (following notice by a party of non-renewal) or be terminated, or the contract terms may be renegotiated in a manner adverse to us. In addition, our growth strategy contemplates leveraging these existing management contracts to add services provided to our members under our management contracts and increase the management fees to cover those new services. There are no guarantees that this strategy will be successful. We believe there are limits to how much we can increase management fees before the HOAs and Diamond Collections are unwilling or unable to pay such increased fees, and, if such fees are perceived as being too high by prospective customers, our VOI sales may be adversely affected.\nOur growth strategy also contemplates our acquisition of, and entry into, new management contracts. We face significant competition to secure new contracts and may be unsuccessful in doing so on favorable terms, if at all.\nTo the extent our rental proceeds may decline or our vacation interest carrying costs may increase, we may not be able to cover certain other expenditures against which we offset rental proceeds.\nUnder our inventory recovery agreements, we are required to pay owners' past due maintenance and assessment fees to the HOAs and Diamond Collections. See \"Item 1. Business-Recovery of VOIs.\" In order to offset these expenses, we rent the available units, in which case we are also obligated to pay to the HOAs and Diamond Collections cleaning fees for room stays incurred by our guests who stay with us on a per-night or per-week basis. In 2014, 2013 and 2012, our net vacation interest carrying costs, consisting of carrying costs related to the VOIs that we owned in each of these periods, less amounts generated from rental of these VOIs in these periods were $35.5 million, $41.3 million and $36.4 million, respectively. Additionally, participating members can rent private luxury properties, book high-profile sporting events and take customized international guided excursions by depositing a designated number of points with us. In turn, we pay a usage fee to third parties on behalf of our members. See \"Item 1. Business-Our Resort Network-Diamond Luxury Selection.\" Similarly, under arrangements that we have with certain of our affiliated resorts, holders of our points or intervals who desire to stay at any such affiliated resort deposit points with us and, in exchange, we pay our affiliated resort the funds required to allow such holder access to the desired unit. In order to offset these payments to the third parties or the affiliated resorts, as applicable, we rent available units at our managed resorts. Our ability to rent units is subject to a variety of risks common to the hospitality industry, including competition from large and well-established hotels, changes in the number and occupancy and room rates for hotel rooms, seasonality and changes in the desirability of geographic regions of the resorts in our network. In addition, we experience strong competition in the rental market and are at a disadvantage when competing against larger and better-established hotel and resort chains that focus on the rental market, have more experience in and greater resources devoted to such market, and can offer rental customers additional benefits such as loyalty points related to rentals and a significantly larger pool of potentially available rental options.\nWe have incurred net losses in the past and may not experience positive net income in the future.\nWe have incurred net losses in the past and we may incur net losses in the future. As of December 31, 2014, our accumulated deficit was $180.5 million. Excluding a non-recurring gain on bargain purchase from business combination of $2.9 million and $20.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, our net losses for such periods were $5.4 million and $7.0 million, respectively. Any failure by us to obtain or sustain profitability, or to continue our revenue growth, could cause the price of our common stock to decline significantly.\nWe utilize external exchange program affiliations as important sources of sales prospects and leads, and any failure to maintain such affiliations could reduce these prospects.\nWe have an affiliation agreement for an external exchange program with Interval International, which was renegotiated in April 2014 and complements our own vacation ownership exchange programs. As a result of this affiliation, members of THE Club may use their points to reserve the use of a vacation accommodation at more than 2,900 resorts worldwide that participate in Interval International. In addition, interval owners at our managed resorts may join either Interval International or RCI, as their HOA constitutions dictate. Such interval owners may then deposit their deeded intervals in exchange for an alternative vacation destination. When our points and intervals are exchanged through Interval International or RCI, this inventory is made available to owners from other resorts, who are potential customers for our VOI sales. If we do not maintain our external exchange program affiliations, the number of individuals exchanging interests through these programs to stay at our managed resorts may decline substantially.\nWe are dependent on the managers of our affiliated resorts to ensure that those properties meet our customers' expectations.\nThe members of the Clubs have access to all or a portion of the 236 affiliated resorts and hotels and four cruise itineraries in our network. We do not manage, own or operate these resorts, hotels or cruises, and we have limited or no ability to control their management and operations. If the managers of a significant number of those properties were to fail to maintain them in a manner consistent with our standards of quality, we may be subject to customer complaints and our reputation and brand could be damaged. In addition, our affiliation agreements with these resorts may expire, be terminated or not be renewed, or may be renegotiated in a manner adverse to us, and we may be unable to enter into new agreements that provide members of the Clubs with equivalent access to additional resorts.\nThe resale market for VOIs could adversely affect our business.\nThere is not currently an active, organized or liquid resale market for VOIs, and resales of VOIs generally are made at sales prices substantially below their original customer purchase prices. These factors may make the initial purchase of a VOI less attractive to potential buyers who are concerned about their ability to resell their VOI. Also, buyers who seek to resell their VOIs compete with our own VOI sales efforts. If the secondary market for VOIs were to become more organized and liquid, the resulting availability of resale VOIs (particularly where the VOIs are available for sale at lower prices than ours) could adversely affect our sales and our sales prices. Furthermore, the volume of VOI inventory that we recapture each year may decline if a viable secondary market develops.\nWe are subject to certain risks associated with our management of resort properties.\nThrough our management of resorts and ownership of VOIs, we are subject to certain risks related to the physical condition and operation of the managed resort properties in our network, including:\n\u2022\nthe presence of construction or repair defects or other structural or building damage at any of these resorts, including resorts we may develop in the future;\n\u2022\nany noncompliance with or liabilities under applicable environmental, health or safety regulations or requirements or building permit requirements relating to these resorts;\n\u2022\nany damage resulting from natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, floods and windstorms, which may increase in frequency or severity due to climate change or other factors; and\n\u2022\nclaims by employees, members and their guests for injuries sustained on these resort properties.\nSome of these risks may be more significant in connection with the properties for which we recently acquired management agreements, particularly those management agreements which were acquired from operators in financial distress. For additional risks related to our acquired businesses, see \u201cOur strategic transactions may not be successful and may divert our management's attention and consume significant resources.\u201d If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs as a result of any of the foregoing, we or the HOAs or Diamond Collections may be subject to significant costs. See \u201cThe properties included in our resort network may experience damages that are not covered by insurance.\u201d\nAdditionally, a number of U.S. federal, state and local laws, including the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, impose requirements related to access to and use by disabled persons of a variety of public accommodations and facilities. A determination that our managed resorts are subject to, and that they are not in compliance with, these accessibility laws could result in a judicial order requiring compliance, imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. If an HOA at one of our managed resorts was required to make significant improvements as a result of non-compliance with these accessibility laws, assessments might be needed to fund such improvements, which additional costs may cause our VOI owners to default on their consumer loans from us or cease making required HOA maintenance fee or assessment payments. Also, to the extent that we hold interests in a particular resort (directly or indirectly through our interests in a Diamond Collection), we would be responsible for our pro rata share of the costs of such improvements. In addition, any new legislation may impose further burdens or restrictions on property owners with respect to access by disabled persons.\nThe resort properties that we manage are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, natural resources and worker health and safety, including laws and regulations governing and creating liability relating to the management, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and other regulated materials and the cleanup of contaminated sites. The resorts are also subject to various environmental laws and regulations that govern certain aspects of their ongoing operations. These laws and regulations control such things as the nature and volume of wastewater discharges, quality of water supply and waste management practices. To the extent that we hold interests in a particular resort (directly or\nindirectly through our interests in a Diamond Collection), we would be responsible for our pro rata share of losses sustained by such resort as a result of a violation of any such laws and regulations.\nThe properties included in our resort network may experience damages that are not covered by insurance.\nOur managed resorts are covered by all-risk property insurance policies with fire, flood, windstorm and earthquake coverage, as well as additional coverage for business interruption arising from insured perils. However, market forces beyond our control may limit the scope of the insurance coverage that we obtain or our ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates. Specifically, certain types of losses, such as losses arising from acts of war or terrorism, are generally not insured because they are either uninsurable or not economically feasible to insure. Accordingly, our insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in every circumstance. In the event of an uninsured loss, including a loss in excess of insured limits, at any of the resorts in our network, such resorts may not be adequately repaired in a timely manner or at all and we may lose some or all of the future revenues anticipated to be derived from such resorts.\nFurthermore, if an HOA or Diamond Collection is subject to any such loss, we will also be responsible for a portion of such loss to the extent of our ownership of VOIs in the resort or Diamond Collection, and any substantial assessments charged by the HOAs or Diamond Collections as a result of any of these items could cause customer dissatisfaction and harm our business and reputation. For example, in October 2011, the HOA of one of our managed resorts levied an assessment to the owner-families of that resort for water intrusion damage. The original amount of the assessment was $65.8 million, but, in connection with the settlement of a class action, the assessment was reduced to $60.9 million. For deeded inventory or Diamond Collection points held by us at the time of the assessment, we owed $9.7 million of the original assessment; however, as a result of the settlement, this was subsequently reduced by $1.2 million. This assessment is payable in annual installments over five years. In addition, pursuant to the related class action settlement, we agreed to pay any amount of assessments defaulted on by owners in return for our recovery of the related VOIs. See \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\"\nWe generally renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. If the cost of coverage becomes too high, we may need to reduce our policy limits, increase the deductibles or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage in order to reduce the premiums to an acceptable amount. Natural disasters and other catastrophic events could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain adequate future insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates.\nOur international operations are subject to risks not generally applicable to our North American operations, including risks related to difficult economic conditions in certain parts of Europe.\nWe manage resorts in 12 countries and have sales and marketing operations in 13 countries. Our operations in foreign countries are subject to a number of particular risks, including:\n\u2022\nexposure to local economic conditions;\n\u2022\npotential adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the U.S.;\n\u2022\nhostility from local populations;\n\u2022\nrestrictions and taxes on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of government policies and regulations against business and real estate ownership by foreigners;\n\u2022\nforeign investment restrictions or requirements;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to legally enforce our contractual rights in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nregulations restricting the sale of VOIs, as described in \u201cBusiness-Governmental Regulation;\u201d\n\u2022\nforeign exchange restrictions and the impact of exchange rates on our business;\n\u2022\nconflicts between local laws and U.S. laws;\n\u2022\nwithholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by our subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nchange in and application of foreign taxation structures, including value added taxes.\nIn addition, Europe and certain European Union countries in particular, continue to experience high levels of unemployment and other difficult economic conditions. These conditions have had and may continue to have, a negative effect\non the global economy as a whole and on our managed resorts and sales and marketing operations located in Europe. In addition, we now provide special termination rights to purchasers of points in our European Collection who meet specified conditions.\nWe are also subject to the laws and regulations of the European Union and countries in which we operate resorts. See \u201cItem 1. Business -- Governmental Regulation.\u201d Our international business operations are also subject to various anti-corruption laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d). The FCPA and similar anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or generating business. We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and procedures will always protect us from the reckless or criminal acts that may be committed by our employees or third parties with whom we work. If we are found to be liable for violations of the FCPA or similar anti-corruption laws in international jurisdictions, criminal or civil penalties could be imposed on us.\nWe are exploring growth opportunities in new international markets in which we have limited experience, including developing markets in Asia and Latin America, which are challenging.\nWe are exploring growth opportunities in geographic markets such as Asia (including China) and Latin America. We currently have affiliation agreements in place with a number of resorts in Asia and a few resorts in Latin America, and may explore additional co-branding opportunities with existing resorts, joint ventures or other strategic alliances with local or regional operators in those markets. For example, we have entered into a joint venture to create, market, sell and service vacation packages and associated benefits (including vacation ownership) to customers in Asia.\nWe may also expand our footprint in these and other international markets by pursuing acquisitions, similar to those we have completed recently, where we would acquire resort businesses consisting of management contracts, unsold VOI inventory and an existing membership base. If we expand into new international markets, we will have only limited experience in marketing and selling our products and services in those markets. Expansion into new and developing international markets is challenging, requires significant management attention and financial resources and may require us to attract, retain and manage local offices or personnel in such markets. It also requires us to tailor our services and marketing to local markets and adapt to local cultures, languages, regulations and standards. To the extent we are unable to adapt, or to the extent that we are unable to find suitable acquisition targets or potential affiliates in such markets or to the extent that any such acquisition or existing or future relationships with affiliates in such markets are not as beneficial to us as we expect, our expansion may not be successful. In some of these markets, including China, the concept of vacation ownership is relatively novel. As a result, in these markets there is limited infrastructure and government support for the vacation ownership industry and the industry may lack sufficient mechanisms for consumer protection. There is also currently not a large supply of vacation ownership products and resorts in those markets, which may limit opportunities and increase competition for those limited opportunities.\nIn addition, many countries in Asia and Latin America are emerging markets and are subject to greater political, economic, legal and social risks than more developed markets, including risks relating to:\n\u2022\npolitical and governmental instability, including domestic political conflicts and inability to maintain consensus;\n\u2022\neconomic instability, including weak banking systems, inflation and currency risk, lack of capital, and changing or inconsistent economic policy;\n\u2022\nweaknesses in legal systems, including inconsistent or uncertain national and local regimes, unavailability of judicial or administrative guidance and inexperience;\n\u2022\ntax uncertainty, including tax law changes, limited tax guidance and difficulty determining tax liability or planning tax-efficient structures;\n\u2022\nthe lack of reliable official government statistics or reports; and\n\u2022\norganized crime, money laundering and other crime.\nThere are also risks related to entering into joint ventures or strategic alliances with local or regional operators, including the joint venture with respect to operations in Asia noted above, such as the possibility that these operators might become bankrupt or fail to otherwise meet their obligations to us. We may not have, and specifically as a minority investor in the venture with respect to operations in Asia, we do not have, control over the joint venture's business or the decisions of the venture, and the other parties to the joint venture may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Disputes\nbetween us and our partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business. In addition, we may, in some circumstances, be liable for the actions of our partners. Furthermore, if we do enter into joint ventures or other affiliations with local or regional operators and a significant number of such operators fail to maintain their properties or provide services in a manner consistent with our standards of quality, we may be subject to customer complaints and our reputation and brand could be damaged. To the extent we expand into new international markets, our exposure to the risks described above in \u201cOur international operations are subject to risks not generally applicable to our domestic operations\u201d will also increase.\nOur industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively.\nThe vacation ownership industry is highly competitive. We compete against not only vacation ownership companies, but also vacation ownership divisions of other hospitality companies, including various high profile and well-established operators, some of which have substantially greater liquidity and financial resources than we do. Some of these operators also have substantially greater experience and familiarity with emerging international markets, such as Latin America and Asia, in which we intend to explore or may continue to explore, opportunities. Many of the world's most recognized lodging, hospitality and entertainment companies develop and sell VOIs in resort properties. Our competitors include Bluegreen Corporation, Hilton Hotels Corporation, Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation, Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, Inc. and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation. We also compete with numerous other smaller owners and operators of vacation ownership resorts, as well as alternative lodging companies, such as HomeAway and Airbnb, which operate websites that market available furnished, privately-owned residential properties in locations throughout the world, including homes and condominiums, that can be rented on a nightly, weekly or monthly basis. Additionally, due to the recent economic climate, many competitors have had difficulty maintaining their highly-leveraged, development-focused business models and have begun to increase their focus on sales of VOIs and provision of management services. Furthermore, a number of our competitors, including companies with well-known brand names in the hospitality industry, have adopted strategies and product offerings comparable to ours, such as offering points-based VOI systems, thereby reducing our competitive advantage. Our competitors could also seek to compete against us based on the pricing terms of our current hospitality management contracts or in our efforts to expand our fee based income streams by pursuing new management contracts for resorts that are not currently part of our network. We may not be able to compete successfully for customers, and increased competition could result in price reductions and reduced margins, as well as adversely affect our efforts to maintain and increase our market share.\nOur existing indebtedness or indebtedness that we may incur in the future could adversely affect us, and the terms of our debt covenants could limit how we conduct our business and our ability to raise additional funds.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $442.8 million in principal amount outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility, $509.4 million of non-recourse indebtedness in securitization notes and borrowings of our subsidiaries and $4.6 million of other recourse indebtedness, for total principal indebtedness of $956.8 million (excluding original issue discounts). See \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for additional information. Our ability to maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities to make scheduled payments, including excess cash flow payments as required under our Senior Credit Facility, or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our future financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to various financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures or sell assets, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Further, our indebtedness may impair our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, restructuring, acquisitions or general corporate purposes, or such financing may not be available on terms favorable to us. We may also incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face, as described above, could intensify.\nIn addition, the Senior Credit Facility and the agreements governing other debt obligations contain, and the agreements that govern our future indebtedness may contain, covenants that restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on our assets;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other equity distributions;\n\u2022\npurchase or redeem equity interests or subordinated debt;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates.\nAs a result of these covenants, we could be limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\nOur business plan historically has depended on our ability to sell, securitize or borrow against the consumer loans that we generate, and our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely impacted if we are unable to do so in the future.\nWe generally offer financing of up to 90% of the purchase price to qualified customers who purchase VOIs through our U.S., Mexican and St. Maarten sales centers, and a significant portion of customers choose to take advantage of this opportunity. For example, from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2014, we financed approximately 75.7% of the total amount of our VOI sales. Our ability to borrow against or sell our consumer loans has been an important element of our continued liquidity, and our inability to do so in the future could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and cash flow. Furthermore, our ability to generate sales of VOIs to customers who require or desire financing may be impaired to the extent we are unable to borrow against such loans on acceptable terms.\nIn the past, we have sold or securitized a substantial portion of the consumer loans we originated from our customers. If we are unable to continue to participate in securitization transactions or generate liquidity and create capacity on our Funding Facilities, on acceptable terms, our liquidity and cash flows will be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, if we cannot offer financing to our customers who purchase VOIs through our U.S., Mexican and St. Maarten sales centers, our sales will be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, we have historically relied on our Funding Facilities to provide working capital for our operations. The Funding Facilities are asset-backed commercial finance facilities either secured by, or funded through the sale of, our consumer loans. The initial maturities of our consumer loans are typically 10 years, as compared to the one-to-two-year term of a typical conduit facility, which provides us with greater liquidity. Our conduit facility originally entered into on November 3, 2008 (as amended and extended, including most recently in February 2015, the \u201cConduit Facility\u201d) that expires on April 10, 2017 and is renewable upon maturity for 364-day terms at the election of the lenders. Our loan sale facility with Quorum Federal Credit Union (\u201cQuorum\u201d) that became effective on April 30, 2010 (as amended and restated, the \u201cQuorum Facility\u201d) has a funding term ending on December 31, 2015, which may be extended by Quorum for additional one-year periods. If we are unable to extend or refinance our Funding Facilities by securitizing our consumer loan receivables or entering into new Funding Facilities, our ability to access sufficient working capital to fund our operations may be materially adversely affected and we may be required to curtail our sales, marketing and consumer finance operations. See \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for additional information.\nTo the extent that our Conduit Facility, Quorum Facility, Senior Credit Facility and operating cash flow are not sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, our ability to sustain our existing operations will be impaired.\nWe may be unable to raise additional capital we need to grow our business.\nWe may need to raise additional capital to expand our operations and pursue our growth strategies, including potential acquisitions of complementary businesses, and to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements. Prior to the IPO, we relied upon affiliates of certain of our major equity holders to provide debt financing for strategic acquisitions. However, these entities may not provide such financing in the future, and we may not otherwise be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, which could impair our growth and adversely affect our existing operations. If we raise additional equity financing, our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests, and the per share value of our common stock could decline.\nOur credit underwriting standards may prove to be inadequate, and we could incur substantial losses if the customers we finance default on their obligations. In addition, we rely on certain third-party lenders to provide financing to purchasers of our VOIs in Europe, and the loss of these customer financing sources could harm our business.\nWe generally offer financing of up to 90% of the purchase price to qualified purchasers of VOIs sold through our U.S., Mexican and St. Maarten sales centers. There is no assurance that the credit underwriting system we utilize as part of our domestic consumer finance activities will result in acceptable default rates or otherwise ensure the continued performance of our consumer loan portfolio. The default rate on our consumer loan portfolio was 6.3% (as a percentage of our outstanding\noriginated portfolios) for 2014, and ranged from 5.7% to 8.6% on an annual basis from 2009 through 2014. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 5.3% (based on loan balance) of our VOI consumer loans that we held, or which third parties held under sales transactions, and that were not in default (which we define as having occurred upon the earlier of (i) the completion of cancellation or foreclosure proceedings or (ii) the customer\u2019s account becoming over 180 days delinquent) were more than 30 days past due. Although in many cases we may have personal recourse against a buyer for the unpaid purchase price, certain states have laws that limit our ability to recover personal judgments against customers who have defaulted on their loans. Even where permitted, attempting to recover a personal judgment may not be advisable due to the associated legal costs and the potential adverse publicity. Historically, we have generally not pursued personal recourse against our customers, even when available. If we are unable to collect the defaulted amount due, we traditionally have foreclosed on the customer's VOI or terminated the underlying contract and remarketed the recovered VOI. Irrespective of our remedy in the event of a default, we cannot recover the often significant marketing, selling and administrative costs associated with the original sale, and we will have to incur a portion of such costs again to resell the VOI. See \u201cThe resale market for VOIs could adversely affect our business\u201d for additional risks related to the resale of VOIs.\nCurrently, portions of our consumer loan portfolio are concentrated in certain geographic regions within the U.S. As of December 31, 2014, our loans to California, Arizona and Florida residents constituted 32.4%, 8.6% and 5.7% of our consumer loan portfolio, respectively. No other state or foreign country concentration accounted for in excess of 5.0% of our consumer loan portfolio. Some of these states have been particularly negatively impacted during the economic downturn in recent years, for example, the real estate market in Florida continues to experience one of the highest rates of foreclosure filings in the U.S., and unemployment rates in California remain high as compared to the U.S. generally. Any deterioration of the economic condition and financial well-being of the regions in which we have significant loan concentration could adversely affect our consumer loan portfolio.\nWe could incur material losses if there is a significant increase in the delinquency rate applicable to our portfolio of consumer loans. An increased level of delinquencies could result from changes in economic or market conditions, increases in interest rates, adverse employment conditions and other factors beyond our control. Increased delinquencies could also result from our inability to evaluate accurately the credit worthiness of the customers to whom we extend financing or our inability to maintain the hospitality level that our customers have come to expect. If default rates for our borrowers were to increase, we may be required to increase our provision for loan losses. In addition, increased delinquency rates may cause buyers of, or lenders whose loans are secured by, our consumer loans to reduce the amount of availability under our Funding Facilities, or to increase the interest costs associated with such facilities. In such an event, our cost of financing would increase, and we may not be able to secure financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nUnder the terms of our securitization facilities, we may be required, under certain circumstances, to repurchase or replace loans if we breach any of the representations and warranties we made at the time we sold the receivables. Moreover, under the terms of our securitization facilities, in the event of defaults by customers in excess of stated thresholds, we may be required to pay substantially all of our cash flow from our retained interest in the underlying receivable portfolios sold to the parties who purchased the receivables from us.\nFinally, we rely on certain third-party lenders to provide consumer financing for sales of our VOIs in Europe. If these lenders discontinue providing such financing, or materially change the terms of such financing, we would be required to find an alternative means of financing for our customers in Europe. If we failed to find another lender, our VOI sales in Europe may decline.\nChanges in interest rates may increase our borrowing costs and otherwise adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on the securitization markets to provide liquidity for our consumer finance operations. Increases in interest rates, changes in the financial markets and other factors could increase the costs of our securitization financings, prevent us from accessing the securitization markets and otherwise reduce our ability to obtain the funds required for our consumer financing operations. To the extent interest rates increase and to the extent legally permitted, we may be required to increase the rates we charge our customers to finance their purchases of VOIs. Our business and results of operations are dependent on the ability of our customers to finance their purchase of VOIs, and in the U.S. we believe we are currently the only generally available lending source to directly finance the sales of our VOIs. Limitations on our ability to provide financing to our customers at acceptable rates or increases in the cost of such financing could reduce our sales of VOIs.\nChanges in the U.S. tax and other laws and regulations may adversely affect our business.\nThe U.S. government may revise tax laws, regulations or official interpretations in ways that could have a significant adverse effect on our business, including modifications that could reduce the profits that we can effectively realize from our international operations, or that could require costly changes to those operations, or the way in which they are structured. For example, the effective tax rates for most U.S. companies reflect the fact that income earned and reinvested outside the U.S. is\ngenerally taxed at local rates, which are often much lower than U.S. tax rates. If changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations significantly increase the tax rates on non-U.S income, our effective tax rate could increase and our profits could be reduced. If such increases resulted from our status as a U.S. company, those changes could place us at a disadvantage to our non-U.S. competitors if those competitors remain subject to lower local tax rates.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our reported results of operations.\nIn addition to our operations in the U.S., we conduct operations in international markets from which we receive, at least in part, revenues in foreign currencies. For example, we receive Euros and British Pound Sterling in connection with our European managed resorts and European VOI sales and Mexican Pesos in connection with our operations in Mexico. Because our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in the value of the Euro and British Pound Sterling against the U.S. dollar have had and will continue to have an effect, which may be significant, on our reported financial results. Exchange rates have been volatile in recent years, due in part to the recent European debt crisis and European central banks taking actions to support their financial system and such volatility may persist due to economic and political circumstances in individual Euro zone countries. A decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies in which we receive revenues, including the Euro, British Pound Sterling or Mexican Peso, against the U.S. dollar will tend to reduce our reported revenues and expenses, while an increase in the value of any such foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar will tend to increase our reported revenues and expenses. Variations in exchange rates can significantly affect the comparability of our financial results between financial periods.\nWe are also exploring international expansion opportunities in markets such as Asia and Latin America, including pursuing acquisitions in those geographic areas, or seeking out co-branding opportunities, joint ventures or other strategic alliances with local or regional operators in those markets. Any such international expansion would result in increased foreign exchange risk, as described above, as the revenue received from such expansion would primarily be in non-U.S. currency.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation relating to the marketing and sale of vacation interests and the servicing and collection of customer loans.\nAs discussed above, our marketing and sale of VOIs and our other operations are subject to extensive regulation by the federal government and state timeshare laws and, in some cases, by the foreign jurisdictions where our VOIs are located, marketed and sold. For a list of certain U.S. federal legislation that is or may be applicable to the sale, marketing and financing of our VOIs, see \"Item 1. Business -- Governmental Regulation.\" In addition, the majority of states and jurisdictions where the resorts in our network are located extensively regulate numerous aspects of our industry, and many other states and certain foreign jurisdictions have adopted similar legislation and regulations affecting the marketing and sale of VOIs to persons located in those jurisdictions. Furthermore, most states have other laws not specific to our industry that apply to our activities, and all of the countries in which we operate have consumer protection and other laws that regulate our activities in those countries.\nAs discussed above, a number of U.S. federal, state and local laws, including the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, impose requirements and create certain risks related to access to and use by disabled persons of a variety of public accommodations and facilities. See \"We are subject to certain risks associated with our management of resort properties.\"\nA determination that specific provisions or operations of the Diamond Collections do not comply with relevant timeshare acts or applicable law may have a material adverse effect on us, the trustees of the Diamond Collections, the Collection Associations or the related consumer loans. Such noncompliance could also adversely affect the operation of the Diamond Collections or the sale of points within the existing format of the Diamond Collections, which would likely increase costs of operations or the risk of losses resulting from defaulted consumer loans.\nMoreover, from time to time potential buyers of VOIs assert claims with applicable regulatory agencies against our vacation interest salespersons for unlawful sales practices. These claims could have adverse implications for us that could result in negative public relations, potential litigation and regulatory sanctions.\nWe currently sell VOIs in the U.S. solely through our employees, and in Europe, we currently sell VOIs through employees and third-party sales agents. In the event the federal, state or local taxing authorities in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions were to successfully classify such independent contractors or sales agents as our employees, rather than as independent contractors, we could be liable for back payroll taxes, termination indemnities and potential claims related to employee benefits, as required by local law. See \"Item 1. Business--Governmental Regulation.\"\nWe are also subject to the laws and regulations of Mexico with respect to our operations of resorts located in Mexico. As discussed above, for purposes of ownership of land in Mexico foreign parties may acquire property located near Mexico's beaches and borders if they (i) agree not to invoke the protection of their governments in matters relating thereto and (ii) take\ntitle through a Mexican trust or subsidiary. Noncompliance with such agreement by a foreign party, however, would result in forfeiture of the property to the country of Mexico. See \"Item 1. Business--Governmental Regulation.\"\nDepending on the provisions of applicable law and the specific facts and circumstances involved, violations of these laws, policies or principles may limit our ability to collect all or part of the principal or interest due on our consumer loans, may entitle certain customers to refund of amounts previously paid and could subject us to penalties, damages and administrative sanctions, and may also impair our ability to commence cancellation and forfeiture proceedings on our VOIs.\nWe are a party to certain litigation matters and are subject to additional litigation risk.\nFrom time to time, we or our subsidiaries are subject to certain legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims or proceedings relating to our VOI sales, consumer finance business and hospitality and management services operations. See \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\" Any adverse outcome in any litigation involving us or any of our affiliates could negatively impact our business, reputation and financial condition.\nFailure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect us.\nIn connection with our business, we collect and retain significant volumes of personally identifiable information, including credit card and social security numbers of our customers and other personally identifiable information of our customers and employees. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of the serious threats to information security. Our customers and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information, and the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, both in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Protecting against security breaches, including cyber-security attacks, is an increasing challenge, and penetrated or compromised data systems or the intentional, inadvertent or negligent release or disclosure of data could result in theft, loss, fraudulent or unlawful use of customer, employee or company data. It is possible that our security controls over personally identifiable information, our training of employees on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information that we store and manage. A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer or employee information could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines and litigation.\nOur reputation and financial condition may be harmed by system failures and computer viruses.\nWe maintain a proprietary hospitality management reservation and sales system. The performance and reliability of this system and our technology is critical to our reputation and ability to attract, retain and service our customers. Any system error or failure may significantly delay response times or even cause our system to fail, resulting in the unavailability of our services. Any disruption in our ability to provide the use of our reservation system to the purchasers of our VOIs, including as a result of software or hardware issues related to the reservation system, could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our reputation and business. In addition, a significant portion of our reservations are made through the online reservation system that we operate on behalf of the Diamond Collections and the Clubs as opposed to over the phone, and our costs are significantly lower in connection with bookings through the online reservation system. As a result, if our online reservation system is unavailable for any reason, our costs will increase and the resale value and the marketability of our VOIs may decline, and our members may choose to withhold payments or default on their VOI loans. Our system and operations are vulnerable to interruption or malfunction due to certain events beyond our control, including natural disasters, such as earthquakes, fire and flood, power loss, telecommunication failures, data and other security breaches, break-ins, sabotage, computer viruses, intentional acts of vandalism and similar events. Any interruption, delay or system failure could result in financial losses, customer claims and litigation and damage to our reputation.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and our failure to protect those rights could adversely affect our business.\nOur intellectual property rights, including existing and future trademarks, trade secrets and copyrights, are and will continue to be valuable and important assets of our business. We believe that our proprietary technology, as well as our other technologies and business practices, are competitive advantages and that any duplication by competitors would harm our business. The measures we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective. Additionally, intellectual property laws and contractual restrictions may not prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property or deter others from developing similar technologies. Finally, even if we are able to successfully protect our intellectual property, others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology.\nWe are required to make a number of significant judgments in applying our accounting policies, and our use of different estimates and assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes to our reported financial\ncondition and results of operations. In addition, changes in accounting standards or their interpretation could significantly impact our reported results of operations.\nOur accounting policies are critical to the manner in which we present our results of operations and financial condition. Many of these policies, including with respect to the recognition of revenue and determination of vacation interest cost of sales under Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 978, \u201cReal Estate-Time-Sharing Activities\" (\"ASC 978\") and Accounting Standard Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASU 2014-09\") that was issued in May 2014, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. See \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\" and \"Item7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-New Accounting Pronouncements\" for further detail. We are required to review these estimates regularly and revise them when necessary. Our actual results of operations vary from period to period based on revisions to these estimates. In addition, the regulatory bodies that establish accounting and reporting standards, including the SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the American Institute of CPAs, periodically revise or issue new financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Changes to these standards or their interpretation could significantly impact our reported results in future periods.\nOur directors and executive officers may have interests that could conflict with those of our stockholders.\nThere are relationships and transactions between our company and entities associated with our executive officers and directors. These relationships and transactions, and the financial interests of our executive officers and directors in the entities party to these relationships and transactions, may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest, when these executive officers and directors are faced with decisions involving those other entities. See \"Note 6- Transactions with Related Parties\" of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for further detail on these relationships and transactions.\nOur strategic transactions may not be successful and may divert our management's attention and consume significant resources.\nWe intend to continue our strategy of selectively pursuing complementary strategic transactions. We may also purchase management contracts, including from resort operators facing financial distress, and purchase VOI inventory at resorts that we do not manage, with the goal of acquiring sufficient VOI ownership at such a resort to become the manager of that resort. The successful execution of this strategy will depend on our ability to identify opportunities for potential acquisitions that fit within our capital-light business model, enter into the agreements necessary to take advantage of these potential opportunities and obtain any necessary financing. We may not be able to do so successfully. In addition, our management may be required to devote substantial time and resources to pursue these opportunities, which may impact their ability to manage our operations effectively.\nAcquisitions involve numerous additional risks, including: (i) difficulty in integrating the operations and personnel of an acquired business; (ii) potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our day-to-day operations; (iii) difficulty entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience and in which competitors have a stronger market position; (iv) difficulty maintaining the quality of services that we have historically provided across new acquisitions; (v) potential legal and financial responsibility for liabilities of acquired businesses; (vi) overpayment for the acquired company or assets; (vii) increased expenses associated with completing an acquisition and amortizing any acquired intangible assets and (viii) challenges in implementing uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies throughout an acquired business.\nMost of our acquisitions have focused on acquiring management contracts and related businesses of operators in financial distress or in bankruptcy at the time of such acquisition. If we continue to pursue similar acquisitions, we will be subject to additional risks, including risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy proceedings, the risk that such properties will be in disrepair and require significant investment in order to bring them up to our quality standards, potential exposure to adverse developments in the receivable portfolios that we acquire or agree to manage and limitations on our ability to finance such transactions. Furthermore, the number and quality of opportunities to acquire management contracts and related businesses of operators in financial distress or in bankruptcy may be more limited than they had been in the past. We cannot assure you that our growth strategy will be successful, and our failure to manage and successfully integrate acquired businesses could harm our business.\nWe also intend to expand our business-to-business services provided to resorts in our affiliated resort networks. We cannot assure you that our attempts to expand business-to-business services will be successful, and our failure to expand such services could harm our business and our relationships with those affiliated resorts.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of our Common Stock\nThe concentration of our capital stock ownership with members of management and our Board of Directors and related entities, together with the Director Designation Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement, will limit stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters, including the ability to influence the outcome of director elections and other matters requiring stockholder approval.\nOf the outstanding shares of common stock, members of management and our Board of Directors and related entities, together hold approximately 31.2% of our outstanding common stock. In particular, entities controlled by Stephen J. Cloobeck, our founder and Chairman, hold approximately 22.7% of our outstanding common stock, entities controlled by Lowell D. Kraff, our Vice Chairman, hold approximately 2.5% of our outstanding common stock, and entities controlled by David F. Palmer, our President, Chief Executive Officer and a member of our Board of Directors, hold approximately 5.2% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, certain members of management and our Board of Directors and other stockholders, which collectively hold approximately 46.1% of our outstanding common stock, are parties to a Stockholders\u2019 Agreement (the \u201cStockholders Agreement\u201d) with us, pursuant to which such parties have agreed, subject to the terms of the Stockholders Agreement, in any election of members of our Board of Directors, to vote their shares of our common stock in favor of our Chief Executive Officer, and individuals designated by DRP Holdco, LLC, one of our significant investors (the \"Guggenheim Investor\"), as well as an entity controlled by our founder and Chairman, pursuant to a director designation agreement (the \u201cDirector Designation Agreement\u201d) among us and certain stockholders party to the Stockholders Agreement.\nAs a result of their collective ownership of a substantial amount of our outstanding capital stock, members of management and our Board of Directors, including Messrs. Cloobeck, Kraff and Palmer, and related entities have significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including amendment of our certificate of incorporation, approval of significant corporate transactions and the election of our Board of Directors. This influence could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions practically impossible without the support of such individuals and entities.\nWe incur significant costs and demands upon management and accounting and finance resources as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies; if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and our reputation.\nAs a SEC reporting company, we are required to, among other things, maintain a system of effective internal control over financial reporting, which requires annual management and, now that we no longer qualify as an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the JOBS Act, independent registered public accounting firm assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Over the past few years, we have dedicated a significant amount of time and resources to implement our internal financial and accounting controls and procedures, and have had to retain additional finance and accounting personnel with the skill sets that we need as a SEC reporting company. Substantial work may continue to be required to further implement, document, assess, test and remediate our system of internal controls. We may also need to retain additional finance and accounting personnel in the future.\nIf our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective, if we are not able to issue our financial statements in a timely manner or if we are not able to obtain the required audit or review of our financial statements by our independent registered public accounting firm in a timely manner, we will not be able to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC and the listing requirements of the NYSE. If these events occur, our common stock listing on the NYSE could be suspended or terminated and our stock price could materially suffer. In addition, we or members of our management could be subject to investigation and sanction by the SEC and other regulatory authorities and to stockholder lawsuits, which could impose significant additional costs on us and divert management attention.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to change our management and hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These include provisions that:\n\u2022 classify our Board of Directors;\n\u2022 limit stockholders\u2019 ability to remove directors;\n\u2022 include advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations; and\n\u2022 prohibit stockholders from acting by written consent or calling special meetings.\nFurthermore, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote is necessary to amend or repeal the above provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. In addition, absent approval of our Board of Directors, our amended and restated bylaws may only be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for some litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternate forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer to us or our stockholders or creditors; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions described above. This forum selection provision may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a judicial forum that they find favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or other stockholders.\nOur stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nThe market price for our common stock may be highly volatile. In addition, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including:\n\u2022\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nactions by us or our competitors, such as sales initiatives, acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nchanges in our earnings estimates or expectations as to our future financial performance, as well as financial estimates by securities analysts and investors, and our ability to meet or exceed those estimates or expectations;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u2022\nlegal proceedings involving our company, our industry, or both;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capitalization, including future issuances of our common stock or the incurrence of additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of companies similar to ours;\n\u2022\nthe prospects of the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nactions by institutional and other stockholders;\n\u2022\nspeculation or reports by the press or investment community with respect to us or our industry in general;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, market and political conditions; and\n\u2022\nother risks, uncertainties and factors described in this annual report.\nThe stock markets in general have often experienced volatility that has sometimes been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class-action litigation has often been brought against that company. We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future.\nLitigation of this type may be expensive to defend and may divert our management's attention and resources from the operation of our business.\nFuture sales of common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline significantly as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market. If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or if the public perceives that such sales could occur, there could be an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock, even if there is no relationship between such sales and the performance of our business. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nAlso in the future, we may issue shares of our common stock in connection with investments or acquisitions. The number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could be material.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the stock price of our common stock or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if our operating results do not meet the expectations of the investor community, one or more of the analysts who cover our company may change their recommendations regarding our\ncompany and our stock price could decline.", "PERMNO": 14017, "SIC": 7011, "TIC": "DRII"}
