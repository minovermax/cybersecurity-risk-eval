RISK FACTORS\nRisk Factor Summary\nWe are providing the following summary of the risk factors contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to enhance the readability and accessibility of our risk factor disclosures. We encourage you to carefully review the full risk factors contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in their entirety for additional information. Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, discussed in more detail in the following section. These risks include, among others, the following:\n\u2022Our business relies upon our ability to maintain the technological advances and resources to compete in the rapidly-changing life sciences and diagnostics industry. Our profitability in this industry depends on many other industry-related factors, including the success of our acquisition strategy, maintenance and expansion of our manufacturing operations, protection of cybersecurity and proprietary rights, development of our technology infrastructure and the success of our products in the market, all of which are unpredictable and may adversely impact our business.\n\u2022Our business and products, as well as those of our strategic partners and suppliers, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and may require other industry clearances and approvals. Changes to U.S. legislative, FDA or global regulations may make it more difficult for us to obtain regulatory approval of our products and/or manufacture our products. We are subject to evolving legislative, regulatory, judicial and ethical standards on use of technology and biotechnology.\n\u2022Our revenue depends significantly upon a limited number of direct customers and strategic partners, as well as the establishment and maintenance of relationships with other direct customers and strategic partners. Our business also depends on our ability to attract and retain our management and staff.\n\u2022If our products contribute to a death or a serious injury, or malfunction in certain ways, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions. If we become subject to product liability claims, we may be required to pay damages that exceed our insurance coverage. If we become subject to claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of hazardous materials, we could incur significant cost and time to comply.\n\u2022We face business disruption and related risks resulting from the recent pandemic of the novel coronavirus 2019 virus (COVID-19) and related preventative vaccines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Uncertain economic conditions, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect our business. We expect our operating results, sales and stock price to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\n\u2022Our effective tax rate may fluctuate and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of amounts that have been accrued. We hold cash and cash equivalents at various foreign subsidiaries that may not be readily available to meet domestic cash requirements.\n\u2022We incurred indebtedness by issuing Notes and entering Convertible Note Hedge and Warrant Transactions, which may affect our cash, financial condition and operating results and value of our common stock and other securities\nRisk Factors Relating to Growth and Profitability of Our Business\nThe life sciences and diagnostics industries are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and we may not have the technologies and resources necessary to compete successfully.\nWe compete with companies in the United States and abroad that are engaged in the development and production of similar products. We will continue to face intense competition from existing competitors and other companies seeking to develop and commercialize new technologies. Many of our competitors have access to greater financial, technical, scientific, research, marketing, sales, distribution, service and other resources than we do and may have longer operating histories or more recognizable brand names. These companies may develop technologies that are superior alternatives to our technologies or may be more effective at commercializing their technologies in products.\nThe life sciences and diagnostics industries are characterized by rapid and continuous technological innovation. We may need to develop new technologies for our products to remain competitive. One or more of our current or future competitors could render our present or future products or those of our partners obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances, including the introduction or existence of, competing products or technologies that may be more effective, cheaper or easier to use than our products and technologies. In addition, the introduction or announcement of new products by us or others could result in a delay of or decrease in sales of existing products as we await regulatory approvals, while customers evaluate these new products, or if customers choose to purchase the new products instead of legacy products. We may also encounter other problems in the process of delivering new products to the marketplace such as problems related to design, development, supply chain or manufacturing of such products, and as a result, we may be unsuccessful in selling such products. Our future success depends on our ability to compete effectively against current technologies, as well as to respond effectively to technological advances by developing and marketing products that are competitive in the continually changing technological landscape.\nSeveral companies provide systems and reagents for DNA amplification or detection. Life Technologies Corporation (a Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. brand) and F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. (Roche) sell systems integrating DNA amplification and detection (sequence detection systems) to the commercial market. Life Technologies Corporation (a Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. brand), Roche, Abbott Laboratories, Becton Dickinson and Company, Danaher Corporation, Qiagen N.V., Hologic, Inc., Meridian Bioscience, Inc., bioM\u00e9rieux S.A., Illumina, Inc. and Quidel Corporation sell sequence detection systems, some with separate robotic batch DNA purification systems, and they also sell reagents to the clinical diagnostics market. Other companies offer molecular diagnostic tests. Additionally, we anticipate that in the future, additional competitors will emerge and offer a broad range of competing products, including increasing adoption of competitive products based on mass spectrometry and next generation sequencing test technologies.\nThere are also a number of companies that provide flow cytometry instruments and reagents for research and clinical flow cytometry applications. BD Biosciences and Beckman Coulter sell systems for cell analysis and cell sorting in both the clinical and research markets. Miltenyi Biotec markets systems focused on cell separation, some of which integrate their magnetic separation technology for cell enrichment/depletion. Bio-Rad sells flow analyzers and sorters designed and manufactured by Propel Labs. Attune (part of ThermoFisher Scientific) markets flow cytometers that use acoustic focusing for high cell throughput for rare event analysis. Sony Biotechnology sells cell sorters and analyzers and has recently developed a spectral flow cytometry system that expands the detection of simultaneous fluorescent parameters. Cytek Biosciences has grown from a third-party field service provider to launch its own spectral flow cytometry system. ACEA Biosciences is a relatively new provider of benchtop flow cytometry analyzers. A few companies are reportedly working on systems to compete directly with our Amnis imaging flow cytometers. We anticipate additional competitors will emerge in the future who will offer a broad range of competing products, which will likely both increase awareness and adoption of spectral flow cytometry and imaging flow cytometry.\nIf we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets.\nWe sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product and service introductions and evolving customer needs and industry standards. Many of the businesses competing with us in these industries have significant financial and other resources to invest in new technologies, substantial intellectual property portfolios, substantial experience in new product development, regulatory expertise, manufacturing capabilities and established distribution channels to deliver products to customers. Our products could become technologically obsolete over time, or we may invest in technologies that do not lead to revenue growth or continue to sell products for which the demand from our customers is declining, in which case we may lose market share or not achieve our revenue growth targets. The success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022accurately anticipate customer needs;\n\u2022innovate and develop new technologies and applications;\n\u2022obtain required regulatory clearances;\n\u2022successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;\n\u2022price our products competitively, and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time; and\n\u2022differentiate our offerings from our competitors\u2019 offerings.\nMany of our products are used by our customers to develop, test and manufacture their products. We must anticipate industry trends and consistently develop new products to meet our customers\u2019 expectations. In developing new products, we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of a new product. If we fail to accurately foresee our customers\u2019 needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue. We may also suffer a loss in market share and potential revenue if we are unable to commercialize our products in a timely and efficient manner.\nWe may be unsuccessful in implementing our acquisition strategy. We may face difficulties integrating acquired entities with our existing businesses. Our business may be harmed by prior or future acquisitions.\nAcquisitions of assets or entities designed to accelerate the implementation of our strategic plan are an important element of our long-term strategy. We may be unable to identify and complete appropriate future acquisitions in a timely manner, or at all, and no assurance can be provided that the market price of potential business acquisitions will be acceptable. In addition, many of our competitors have greater financial resources than we have and may be willing to pay more for these businesses or selected assets. In the future, should we identify suitable acquisition targets, we may be unable to complete acquisitions or obtain the financing, if necessary, for these acquisitions on terms favorable to us. Potential acquisitions pose a number of risks, including, among others, that:\n\u2022we may not be able to accurately estimate the financial effect of acquisitions on our business;\n\u2022future acquisitions may require us to incur debt or other obligations, issue additional securities, incur large and immediate write-offs, issue capital stock potentially dilutive to our stockholders or spend significant cash, or may negatively affect our operating results and financial condition;\n\u2022if we spend significant funds or incur additional debt or other obligations, our ability to obtain financing for working capital or other purposes could decline, and we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures;\n\u2022technological advancement or worse than expected performance of acquired businesses may result in the impairment of intangible assets;\n\u2022we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from acquisitions, as a result of inherent risks and uncertainties, including difficulties integrating acquired businesses or retaining their key personnel, partners, customers or other key relationships, entering market segments in which we have no or limited experience, and risks that acquired entities may not operate profitably or that acquisitions may not result in improved operating performance;\n\u2022we may fail to successfully obtain appropriate regulatory approval or clearance for products under development of our acquired businesses;\n\u2022we may be assuming liability for unresolved regulatory risks of our acquired businesses;\n\u2022we may fail to effectively enhance acquired technologies and products to develop new products relating to acquired businesses;\n\u2022our customers may not accept products of our acquired businesses;\n\u2022we may fail to effectively coordinate sales and marketing efforts of our acquired businesses;\n\u2022we may fail to combine product offerings and product lines of our acquired businesses quickly and effectively;\n\u2022we may fail to successfully manage relationships with customers, distributors and suppliers of our acquired businesses;\n\u2022an acquisition may involve unexpected costs or liabilities, including as a result of pending and future shareholder lawsuits relating to acquisitions or exercise by shareholders of their statutory appraisal rights, or the effects of purchase accounting may be different from our expectations;\n\u2022an acquisition may involve significant contingent payments that may adversely affect our future liquidity or capital resources;\n\u2022acquisitions and subsequent integration of these companies may disrupt our business and distract our management from other responsibilities; and\n\u2022the costs of unsuccessful acquisition efforts may adversely affect our financial performance.\nOther risks of integration of acquired businesses include:\n\u2022disparate information technology, internal control, financial reporting and record-keeping systems;\n\u2022differences in accounting policies, including those requiring judgment or complex estimation processes;\n\u2022new partners or customers who may operate on terms and programs different than ours;\n\u2022additional employees not familiar with our operations;\n\u2022unanticipated additional transaction and integration-related costs;\n\u2022our current and prospective customers and suppliers may experience uncertainty associated with an acquisition, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us, and may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business;\n\u2022facilities or operations of acquired businesses in remote locations or potentially foreign jurisdictions and the inherent risks of operating in unfamiliar legal and regulatory environments; and\n\u2022new products, including the risk that any underlying intellectual property associated with such products, may not have been adequately protected or that such products may infringe on the proprietary rights of others.\nEpidemic diseases could negatively affect various aspects of our business, make it more difficult to meet our obligations to our customers, and could result in reduced demand from our customers. These could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nParts of our business have been and continue to be adversely affected by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and may be further affected by the recent availability and distribution of a preventative vaccines. In an effort to halt the outbreak of COVID-19, many countries have placed significant restrictions on travel and congregation, including \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d or similar orders, leading to extended business closures. Individuals who contract the virus may be unavailable to work, and in certain jurisdictions, individuals exposed to the virus, as well as their families and co-workers, may be placed in mandatory quarantines. The spread of the virus, as well as restrictions and business closures implemented in an effort to minimize its spread, can adversely impact our operations, including delaying or suspending our ability to sell or distribute our products, causing temporary closures of our offices and manufacturing operations, or those of our suppliers, customers, distributors and other business partners. Any disruption of our suppliers, customers or distributors could continue to adversely impact our global sales and operating results and harm our reputation. While many businesses have re-opened as the pandemic eased in particular locations, a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in those geographies could cause additional closures. Likewise, we may be subject to public and private litigation based upon, arising out of or related to COVID-19 and our actions and responses thereto, including any determinations that we may make to continue to operate or to re-open our facilities where permitted by local law. We cannot at this time accurately predict what effects these conditions will continue to have on our operations longer-term due to uncertainties relating to the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, the extent and effectiveness of responsive actions by authorities of impacted countries and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers and suppliers. In addition, a significant outbreak of a contagious disease in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries for an extended period of time, resulting in economic uncertainty and volatility that could affect demand for our products, and likely adversely impact our business, operations, financial conditions and results of operations for an indefinite period of time.\nDespite the authorization and distribution of preventative COVID-19 vaccines, there are still uncertainties surrounding the effectiveness, availability and extent of distribution of such vaccines. We cannot predict the effect of such vaccines on us and our vendors, suppliers, and potential sublicensees\u037e the global economy and political conditions\u037e and the health of our personnel, consultants, and their families\u037e all of which will affect how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating activities can resume. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience an adverse effect on our business as a result of its global economic impact, including any resulting and ongoing recession. All of these circumstances likely exert similar hardships on those with which we deal, such as vendors, shippers, distributors, and sublicensees. As a result, we have made adjustments to, and will need to continue to adjust, our business and expenditures in an effort to correlate our activities with business exigencies, including restrictions of executive and employee travel, hiring freezes or delays, and limitations on marketing. The ultimate financial impact and duration of all of the foregoing cannot now be predicted and may well exceed our expectations or our ability to cope with them. Any, or all, of the foregoing uncertainties could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial conditions and results of operations for an indefinite period of time.\nRisks Affecting Our Product Development and Manufacturing Operations\nAs we continue to expand our business, we may experience problems in scaling our manufacturing operations, or delays or component shortages that could limit the growth of our revenue.\nAs we continue to expand our manufacturing capabilities in order to meet our growth objectives, we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of products or maintain consistency between differing lots of consumables. If we encounter difficulties in scaling our manufacturing operations as a result of, among other things, quality control and quality assurance issues and availability of components and raw material supplies, we will likely experience reduced sales of our products, increased repair or re-engineering costs due to product returns and defects and increased expenses due to switching to alternate suppliers, any of which could reduce our revenues and gross margins.\nOur ability to continue to operate without any significant negative operational impact from the COVID-19 pandemic will, in part, depend on our ability to protect our employees and maintain our supply chain. Continued rapid expansion of capacity may be constrained by long lead-time purchased items and capital equipment needs. We continue to endeavor to follow the recommended actions of government and health authorities to protect our employees, with particular measures in place for employees who manufacture our products. However, the complications resulting from the pandemic could result in unforeseen disruptions to our workforce and supply chain, including an inability of a key supplier or transportation supplier to source, transport and supply materials to the Company that are necessary for continued operations, that could individually or in combination with other factors, have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial conditions and results of operations.\nWe presently outsource certain aspects of the assembly of our systems to contract manufacturers. Because of a long lead-time to delivery, we are required to place orders for a variety of items well in advance of scheduled production runs. We have increased our flexibility to purchase strategic components within shorter lead times by entering into supply agreements with the suppliers of these components. Although we attempt to match our parts inventory and production capabilities to estimates of marketplace demand, to the extent system orders materially vary from our estimates, we may experience continued constraints in our systems production and delivery capacity, which could adversely impact revenue in a given fiscal period. Should our need for raw materials and components used in production continue to fluctuate, we could incur additional costs associated with either expediting or postponing delivery of those materials. In an effort to control costs, we have implemented a lean production system. Managing the change from discrete to continuous flow production requires time and management commitment. Lean initiatives and limitations in our supply chain capabilities may result in parts shortages that delay shipments and cause fluctuations in revenue.\nWe currently purchase certain key components of our product line from a limited number of outside sources and, in the case of some components, a single source, and these components may only be available through a limited number of providers. We do not have agreements with all of our suppliers. While we currently believe that we will be able to satisfy our forecasted demand for our products, the failure to find alternative suppliers in the event of any type of supply failure at any of our current vendors at reasonably comparable prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we have entered into supply agreements with most of our suppliers of strategic reagents and component subassemblies to help ensure component availability, and flexible purchasing terms with respect to the purchase of such components. If our suppliers discontinue production of a key component, we will be required to revalidate an affected product and may be required to resubmit a previously cleared product. Our reliance on our suppliers and contract manufacturers exposes us to risks including:\n\u2022the possibility that one or more of our suppliers or our assemblers that do not have supply agreements with us could terminate their services at any time without penalty;\n\u2022natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis and floods that impact our suppliers;\n\u2022the potential obsolescence and/or inability of our suppliers to obtain required components;\n\u2022the potential delays and expenses of seeking alternate sources of supply or manufacturing services;\n\u2022the inability to qualify alternate sources without impacting performance claims of our products;\n\u2022reduced control over pricing, quality and timely delivery due to the difficulties in switching to alternate suppliers or assemblers; and\n\u25e6increases in prices of raw materials and key components.\nConsequently, in the event that supplies of components or work performed by any of our assemblers are delayed or interrupted, our ability to produce and supply our products could be impaired.\nIf a catastrophe strikes our manufacturing or warehousing facilities, we may be unable to manufacture or distribute our products for a substantial amount of time and we may experience inventory shortfalls, which would cause us to experience lost revenues.\nOur manufacturing facilities are located in Austin, Madison, Northbrook, Toronto and Seattle. Although we have business interruption insurance, our facilities and some pieces of manufacturing equipment are difficult to replace and could require substantial replacement lead time. Various types of disasters, including tornadoes, fires, floods and acts of terrorism, may affect our manufacturing facilities. In the event our existing manufacturing facilities or equipment are affected by man-made or natural disasters, we may be unable to manufacture products for sale or meet customer demands or sales projections. If our manufacturing operations were curtailed or ceased, it would seriously harm our business.\nThe property rights we rely upon to protect the technologies underlying our products may not be adequate to maintain market exclusivity. Inadequate intellectual property protection could enable third parties to exploit our technologies or use very similar technologies and could reduce our ability to distinguish our products in the market.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain, protect and enforce patents on our technologies and products and to protect our trade secrets, including the intellectual property of entities we may acquire. Any patents we own may not afford full protection for our technologies and products. Other parties may challenge the validity of our patents and, as a result, our patents could be narrowed or invalidated in administrative or judicial proceedings. In addition, our current and future patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents in the United States or foreign countries. Competitors may develop products that are not covered by our patents. Furthermore, there is a substantial backlog of patent applications at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and certain patent offices in foreign jurisdictions, and the approval or rejection of patent applications may take several years.\nWe currently own 821 issued patents worldwide, including 237 issued patents in the United States. Other countries in which we have issued patents directed to various aspects and applications of our products and technologies include France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, Netherlands, Canada, Hong Kong, China and South Korea, amongst others. In addition, our patent portfolio includes 110 pending patent applications in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions. We also have patents covering key aspects of MultiCode technology, xTAG technology, and nanoparticle technology, utilized in our assays as well as our ARIES and VERIGENE Systems, NxTAG technology imaging flow cytometry technology and capillary flow cytometry technology.\nWe seek to require employees, consultants, strategic partners and other third parties to execute confidentiality agreements. Our employees and third-party consultants also sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interests in inventions and original expressions and any corresponding patents and copyrights arising from their work for us. In addition, we have implemented a patent process to file patent applications on our key technologies. However, we cannot guarantee that these agreements or this patent process will provide us with adequate ownership rights, protection against improper use of our intellectual property, or disclosure of confidential information. In addition, in some situations, these agreements may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees, consultants or advisers have prior employment or consulting relationships. Further, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technologies, techniques and products or counterfeit versions of our products or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets. Our failure to protect our proprietary information and techniques may inhibit or limit our ability to distinguish our products in the market.\nIn order to protect or enforce our patent rights, we may have to initiate legal proceedings against third parties, such as infringement suits or interference proceedings. These legal proceedings could be expensive, take significant time and/or divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. These proceedings may cause us to lose the benefit of some of our intellectual property rights, the loss of which may inhibit or preclude our ability to distinguish our products in the market. These proceedings also may provoke these third parties to assert claims against us. Moreover, a series of decisions from the Supreme Court of the United States have arguably weakened United States patent rights, including the Impression Products v. Lexmark case, which expands the scope of the patent exhaustion doctrine to sales of patented products outside of the United States and limits a patent holder\u2019s ability to enforce post-sale restrictions under patent law. The patent position of companies like ours generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions, and has recently been the subject of much litigation. No consistent policy has emerged from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or the courts regarding the breadth of claims allowed or the degree of protection afforded under patents like ours.\nIf our current products and our products under development do not become widely used in the life sciences and clinical diagnostics industries, we may not be able to maintain or increase profitability.\nLife sciences and clinical diagnostic service provider companies have historically conducted biological tests using a variety of technologies, including bead-based analysis. The commercial success of our products depends upon widespread adoption of our systems as methods to perform assays. In order to be successful, we must convince potential partners and customers to utilize our systems instead of other competing products. Market acceptance depends on many factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022timely and successfully launch our products under development;\n\u2022manage trends relating to, or the introduction or existence of, competing products or technologies that may be more effective, cheaper or easier to use than our products and technologies;\n\u2022operate in a highly competitive marketplace, including in the presence of competing products sold by companies with longer operating histories, more recognizable names and more established distribution networks;\n\u2022convince prospective strategic partners and customers that our products are an attractive alternative to others for research, clinical, biomedical and genetic testing and analysis;\n\u2022encourage these partners to develop and market products using our technologies;\n\u2022manufacture products in sufficient quantities with acceptable quality and at an acceptable cost;\n\u2022obtain and maintain sufficient pricing and royalties from partners on such Luminex products; and\n\u2022place and service sufficient quantities of our products at the level of service required in the life science and clinical diagnostics market segments.\nIn the molecular diagnostics sector, we must recognize significant market uptake in order to gain operational efficiencies and reduce costs based on increased volume.\nBecause of these and other factors, our products may not gain or sustain sufficient market acceptance to maintain or increase profitability. Additionally, we may have to write off excess or obsolete inventory if sales of our products are not consistent with our expectations or if the demand for our products changes.\nRisks Related to Customers and Partners\nCurrently, a limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenue and the loss of any one of these or their inability to perform to expectations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our success depends significantly on the establishment and maintenance of successful relationships with our customers.\nOur two largest customers accounted for 14% of total revenue in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, with one of the customers accounting for 10%. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our two largest customers accounted for 17% and 29% of total revenue, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 4% of total revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. In total, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our top five customers accounted for 22% and 30%, respectively, of our total revenue. The loss of any of our significant direct customers, strategic partners, or the loss of a material portion of the sales to these customers or partners could have a material adverse effect on our growth and future results of operations.\nIf third-party payors continue to increasingly restrict payments for healthcare expenses or fail to adequately pay for multi-analyte testing, we may experience reduced sales, which would hurt our business and our business prospects.\nThird-party payors, government-sponsored healthcare programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare), health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and other private or commercial insurers are continually seeking to reduce healthcare expenses. Payors are challenging the utilization of, and prices charged for, medical services, including clinical diagnostic tests. The federal government has implemented cost-cutting strategies for government-sponsored healthcare programs, including coverage limitations and reimbursement rate reductions required by the Affordable Care Act. As a result of regulations issued pursuant to the Protecting Access to Medicare Act, payment rates for most tests included in the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule used by Medicare are based on commercial insurance rates, which certain laboratories are required to report. The payment reductions resulting from this revised reimbursement methodology are capped at 10% for 2020 and 15% for each of 2021 through 2023. We expect reimbursement rates to trend down over time. Coverage and reimbursement from commercial payors may also reflect these reductions.\nFurther cost containment initiatives by governmental or educational entities or programs may reduce funding for genetic research and development activities and slow the growth of the genetic testing market. Lack of adequate coverage or reimbursement for our products could affect consumer demand, reducing volumes or adding additional cost pressures, resulting in lowered prices for our products. Efforts by group purchasing organizations and other large purchasers to reduce costs may also result in lowered prices or deeper discounts on our products. Reduced sales or margins by us, or our direct customers, and strategic partners, would adversely affect our business, profitability and business prospects. In addition, failure to secure appropriate reimbursement in foreign jurisdictions could severely limit our ability to expand sales within these markets.\nDelays in implementation, delays in obtaining regulatory approval, changes in strategy, or the financial difficulty of our strategic partners for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to enter into agreements with additional strategic partners depends in part on convincing them that our products can help achieve and accelerate their goals or efforts. We expend substantial funds and management efforts with no assurance that any additional strategic relationships will result. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to negotiate additional strategic agreements in the future on acceptable terms, if at all, or that current or future strategic partners will not pursue or develop alternative technologies either on their own or in collaboration with others. Some of the companies we are targeting as strategic partners offer products competitive with our xMAP Technology, which may hinder or prevent strategic relationships. Delays in implementation of new products by our strategic partners, changes in their strategy, financial difficulties they experience, or delays in obtaining or their inability to obtain regulatory approval for their products, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could negatively affect our business. Termination of strategic relationships, the failure to enter into a sufficient number of additional strategic relationships on favorable terms, or disputes with our partners could reduce sales of our products, lower margins on our products and limit the market demand for and acceptance of our products.\nAs we pursue the development and registration of products, regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries will be a significant factor in the development, testing, production, and marketing of such products. Products that we develop in the molecular diagnostic markets will be regulated as medical devices by the FDA and other global governmental authorities and may require receipt of clearance following a pre-market notification process prior to marketing. Obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals can be expensive and may involve considerable delay. Changes to the current regulatory framework, including additional or new regulations, could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products, which may negatively affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval of our products.\nIf the quality or delivery of our products does not meet our customers\u2019 expectations, our reputation could suffer and ultimately our sales and operating earnings could be negatively impacted.\nIn the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services, including defects in our engineering, design, manufacturing and delivery processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. Because our instruments and consumables are highly complex, the occurrence of defects may increase as we continue to introduce new products and services and as we rapidly scale up manufacturing to meet increased demand for our products and services. Although we have established internal procedures to minimize risks that may arise from product quality issues, there can be no assurance that we will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities. In addition, identifying the root cause of quality issues, particularly those affecting reagents and third-party components, may be difficult, which increases the time needed to address quality issues as they arise and increases the risk that similar problems could recur. Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and we may incur significant costs or lost revenue in connection with, for example, shipment holds, product recalls and warranty or other service obligations. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand image, and our reputation as a producer of high quality products could suffer, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf our direct selling efforts for our products are less successful than anticipated, our business expansion plans could suffer and our ability to generate revenues could be diminished.\nIf our direct sales force is not successful, or additions to our sales team fail to gain traction among our customers, we may not be able to increase market awareness and sales of our products, or to maintain historical sales levels. If we fail to establish our systems in the marketplace, it could have a negative effect on our ability to sell subsequent systems and hinder the planned expansion of our business.\nThe commercial launch of the ARIES System was the first Luminex system launch that was not channeled through a partner. The successful execution of our product launch and adoption by our direct customers has been and will continue to be critical to establishing an installed base of satisfied customers. To the extent that these customers do not continue to adopt the menu of ARIES Assays that have been a significant focus of our research and development efforts over the last five years, there is a significant risk that our investment in these assays may not pay off. Additionally, we have made a significant investment in our customer service, support and direct sales force to support the launches of ARIES Systems. Our ability to service, support and sell the ARIES and VERIGENE Systems directly, and not through a partner, may also fail to meet ongoing market expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to service and support our products directly or in collaboration with our strategic partners.\nTo the extent that we or our strategic partners fail to maintain a high quality level of service and support for xMAP products, there is a risk that the perceived quality of our xMAP products will be diminished in the marketplace. Likewise, we may fail to provide the level, quantity or quality of service expected by the marketplace. This could result in slower adoption rates and lower than anticipated utilization of xMAP products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn most of our strategic partnerships, we have granted non-exclusive rights with respect to commercialization of our products and technologies.\nWe expect that a significant portion of our future revenues will come from sales of our systems and the development and sale of kits utilizing our xMAP consumables by our strategic partners and from use of our xMAP products by our strategic partners in performing services offered to third parties. We believe that our strategic partners will have economic incentives to develop and market these products, but we cannot accurately predict future sales and royalty revenues because some of our existing strategic partner agreements do not include minimum purchase requirements or minimum royalty commitments. Some of our existing strategic partner agreements contain minimum purchase requirements for certain years, but unless renegotiated, these minimum purchase requirements could and will expire. In addition, we have no control with respect to our strategic partners\u2019 sales personnel and how they prioritize products based on xMAP technology, nor can we control the timing of the development or release of products by our strategic partners. The amount of these revenues depends on a variety of factors that are outside our control, including the amount and timing of resources that current and future strategic partners devote to developing and marketing products incorporating our technology. Furthermore, the development and marketing of certain kits will require our strategic partners to obtain governmental approvals, which could delay or prevent their commercialization efforts. If our current or future strategic partners do not successfully develop and market products based on our technology and obtain necessary government approvals, our revenues from product sales and royalties could be significantly reduced.\nOur reliance on strategic partnerships makes forecasting difficult.\nAs a result of our reliance on our strategic relationships, it can be difficult to accurately forecast future operating results. Estimating the timing and amount of sales of our products is particularly difficult for the following reasons (among others):\n\u2022we do not control the timing or extent of product development, marketing or sale of our products by our strategic partners;\n\u2022we do not control the incentives provided by our strategic partners and distributors to their sales personnel;\n\u2022we utilize a limited number of geographically focused distributors for a portion of our sales, including sales of several of our key assays, and the loss of or nonperformance by these distributors could harm our revenues in the territories serviced by these distributors;\n\u2022a significant number of our strategic partners intend to produce clinical diagnostic applications that may need to be approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies in jurisdictions outside of the United States;\n\u2022certain strategic partners may have unique requirements for their applications and systems. Assisting the various strategic partners may strain our research and development and manufacturing resources. To the extent that we are unable to timely assist our strategic partners, the commercialization of their products will likely be delayed;\n\u2022certain strategic partners may fail to deliver products that satisfy market requirements, or such products may fail to perform properly;\n\u2022we have limited access to partner and distributor confidential corporate information. A sudden unexpected change in ownership or strategy or other material event due to information of which we are not currently aware could adversely impact partner purchases of our products; and\n\u2022partners tend to order in bulk prior to the production of new lots of their products and prior to major product development initiatives. The frequency of these bulk purchases is difficult to predict and may cause large fluctuations in microsphere sales quarter to quarter.\nThe capital spending policies of our customers have a significant effect on the demand for our products.\nOur customers include clinical diagnostic, pharmaceutical, biotechnological, research institutions, chemical and industrial companies, and the capital spending policies of these companies can have a significant effect on the demand for our products. These policies are based on a wide variety of factors, including general or local economic conditions, governmental regulation or price controls, resources available for purchasing research equipment, government funding, grants, spending priorities among various types of analytical equipment manufacturers and policies regarding capital expenditures during recessionary periods. Any decrease in capital spending by life sciences companies could cause our revenues to decline. As a result, we are subject to significant volatility in revenue. Therefore, our operating results can be materially affected (negatively and positively) by the spending policies and priorities of our customers.\nAdjustments of previously recognized royalty revenue from LTG partners could impact our results of operations and result in our restating financial results for certain fiscal periods.\nThe Company through its LTG enters into contractual arrangements with customers and other third parties, a component of which are royalty arrangements. Such royalty obligations are typically self-reported, paid in the regular course of business and recorded by the Company accordingly. These royalty arrangements may be subject to inspection (either directly by the Company or by a third-party) to seek to assure that the counterparty has made sufficient payment to the Company. Generally, if the Company has inspection rights, the Company may exercise these rights every three years.\nWith respect to royalty reporting, the Company significantly relies upon the accuracy and completeness of the information it receives from its counterparties to determine the appropriate financial reporting. The Company is regularly involved in negotiations, disputes and other discussions regarding these arrangements and the calculation of any royalties. Should differences between submitted royalties and due royalties be claimed or identified, the Company makes a determination as to the proper way to account for such claim or difference. Any claims or differences with respect to previously recognized royalty revenue could result in the Company recording reserves, making a current period adjustment or correcting or potentially restating the Company\u2019s prior financial statements and its related Exchange Act reports during the relevant historical periods (or in prospective periods during which claims are made). The cost and distraction of any such claim, any necessary adjustments or restatement of amounts previously reported and/or any prospective changes to royalty calculations could harm our operating results and adversely impact our business and stock price.\nWe rely on the innovation and resources of larger industry participants and public programs in our partnership business to advance genomic research and educate physicians/clinicians on genetic diagnostics.\nThe linkages between genetic anomalies that our products detect and the underlying disease states are not always fully medically correlated. Additionally, the availability of correlated genetic markers is dependent on significant investment in genomic research, often funded through public programs, for which there are no assurances of ongoing support. Should any government limit patent rights to specific genetic materials, private investment in this area could also be significantly curtailed. In addition, the adoption of genetic diagnostics is dependent to a great extent on the education and training of physicians and clinicians. We do not have the resources to undertake such training, and are relying on larger industry participants and professional medical colleges to establish, communicate and educate physicians and clinicians on best practices related to genetic diagnostics.\nRisks Relating to Regulation of Our Products\nOur products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, the Competent Authorities of EEA Member States and foreign governmental authorities, the Competent Authorities of EEA Member States and foreign governmental authorities, the Competent Authorities of EEA Member States and foreign governmental authorities, including the requirement to obtain premarket approval and the requirement to report adverse events and violations of the FDC Act that could present significant risk of injury to patients. We will continue to be subject to extensive FDA regulatory oversight.\nOur products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory clearances to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming, and we may not be able to obtain these clearances or approvals on a timely basis, if at all. In general, the FDA permits commercial distribution of a new medical device only after the device has received clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDC Act, or is the subject of an approved premarket approval application (PMA), unless the device is specifically exempt from those requirements. The FDA will clear marketing of a lower risk medical device through the 510(k) process if the manufacturer demonstrates that the new product is substantially equivalent to other pre-amendment, 510(k)-exempt, 510(k) cleared products, or PMA-approved products that have subsequently been down-classified. If the FDA determines that the device is not \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to a predicate device, or if the device is automatically classified into Class III, the device sponsor must then fulfill the much more rigorous premarketing requirements of the PMA approval process, or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. Pursuant to amendments to the statute in 2012, a manufacturer can also submit a petition for a direct de novo review if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk.\nHigh risk devices deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices, or devices not deemed substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device, require the approval of a PMA. The PMA process is more costly, lengthy and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data, to demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device for its intended use. Currently, all of our products requiring FDA clearance or approval are Class II and have been cleared through the 510(k) process.\nIn emergency situations, such as a pandemic, the FDA has the authority to issue an EUA for an unapproved device if the following four statutory criteria have been met: (1) a serious or life-threatening condition exists; (2) evidence of effectiveness of the device exists; (3) a risk-benefit analysis shows that the benefits of the product outweigh the risks; and (4) no other alternatives exist for diagnosing, preventing or treating the disease or condition. Once granted, an EUA will remain in effect and generally terminate on the earlier of (1) the determination by the Secretary of HHS that the public health emergency has ceased or (2) a change in the approval status of the product such that the authorized use(s) of the product are no longer unapproved. After the EUA is no longer valid, the product is no longer considered to be legally marketed and one of the FDA\u2019s non-emergency premarket pathways would be necessary to resume or continue distribution of the subject product. The FDA also may revise or revoke an EUA if the circumstances justifying its issuance no longer exist, the criteria for its issuance are no longer met, or other circumstances make a revision or revocation appropriate to protect the public health or safety.\nOur failure to comply with U.S. federal, state and foreign governmental regulations could lead to the issuance of additional warning letters or untitled letters, the imposition of injunctions, suspensions or loss of regulatory clearance or approvals, product recalls, termination of distribution, product seizures or civil penalties. In the most extreme cases, criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities are possible.\nThe recent COVID-19 pandemic has introduced additional strain on the FDA. We are unable to fully understand the impact this may cause on regulations or the related timeframes pertaining to communication with, or clearances by, the FDA.\nOur products are also subject to approval, certification and regulation by foreign regulatory and safety agencies. For example, the EU has adopted the In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (the IVDR), which will impose stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of in vitro diagnostic medical devices, including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance. Manufacturers of currently approved medical devices, as of now, will have until May 26, 2022 to meet the requirements imposed by the IVDR. Complying with the requirements of these regulations may require us to incur significant expenditures. Failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements.\nForeign governmental authorities that regulate the manufacture and sale of medical devices have become increasingly stringent and, to the extent we market and sell our products internationally, we may be subject to rigorous international regulation in the future. In these circumstances, we would rely significantly on our foreign independent distributors to comply with the varying regulations, and any failures on their part could result in restrictions on the sale of our products in foreign countries.\nMarketing of our COVID-19 tests under Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) from FDA is subject to certain limitations and we are required to maintain compliance with the terms of the EUA, among other things, and the continuance of our EUAs is subject to government discretion.\nOn February 4, 2020, then U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Alex Azar issued a declaration that the threat to public health posed by COVID-19 justified the emergency use of unapproved in vitro diagnostics for the detection or diagnosis of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Under Section 564 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), because HHS issued this declaration, the FDA Commissioner was authorized to issue EUAs to permit certain developers of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics to begin offering the tests for detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 without having completed the normally applicable FDA review and clearance or approval process for marketing authorization (with the related standards that would apply to demonstrate safety and effectiveness). The issuance of an EUA at that time reflected an FDA conclusion that, based on the totality of scientific evidence available to the FDA, it was reasonable to believe that the product may be effective in diagnosing COVID-19, and that the known potential benefits of the product outweighed the known and potential risks, and there was no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the emergency use of the product.\nOn March 27, 2020 we received an EUA for our NxTAG CoV Extended Panel Assay for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from the SARS-CoV-2 virus in nasopharyngeal swab specimens from individuals suspected of having COVID-19. We received an EUA on April 3, 2020 for our ARIES SARS-CoV-2 Assay for the same indication, but in this case, tests are permitted to be conducted by CLIA laboratories certified to perform moderate complexity tests, as well as those certified for high complexity tests. We also received an EUA on July 16, 2020 for our xMAP SARS-CoV-2 Multi-Antigen IgG Assay, a serology assay to identify the presence of antibodies in people who have been infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Although there are certain regulatory requirements that the FDA has waived for the duration of the EUA, we remain subject to specific conditions of the authorization, including ensuring appropriate labeling as approved by the FDA specifically for purposes of the EUA, maintaining records of distribution to authorized laboratories, collecting data on occurrences of any false positives or false negatives, and tracking any adverse events.\nAs with other FDA-regulated products, issues could emerge during the course of the marketing and use of our products under an EUA that could impact our ability to continue the sale and distribution of these products (e.g., compliance and product performance issues).\nOur EUAs remain effective only until the HHS declaration is terminated or revoked, and the FDA may also revoke an EUA if it determines the criteria for issuance are no longer met or other circumstances make such revocation appropriate to protect public health or safety. Once our EUA is revoked or terminated, we will be required to stop commercial distribution of our COVID-19 test kit immediately unless we can obtain FDA clearance for our COVID-19 test kit under a traditional regulatory pathway, which is lengthy and expensive, which could harm our future business prospects. We also would be subject to the full and usual regulatory obligations for device manufacturers, including the FDA\u2019s quality system regulations (QSR) under 21 CFR Part 820.\nIf we or our suppliers fail to comply with ongoing FDA or foreign regulatory authority requirements, or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, these products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market.\nAny product for which we obtain clearance, and the manufacturing processes, reporting requirements, post-market clinical data and promotional activities for such product, are subject to continued regulatory review, oversight and periodic inspections by the FDA and other domestic and foreign regulatory bodies and notified bodies. In particular, we and our strategic partners who manufacture medical devices are required to comply with the QSR in the US. The QSR covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of our products. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA. If we, or our strategic partners, fail to adhere to QSR requirements in the U.S. or experience delays in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals or clearances, this could delay production of our products and lead to fines, difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances, recalls, enforcement actions, including injunctive relief or consent decrees, or other consequences, such as the Warning Letter, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We must comply with equivalent standards in third countries. in obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances, recalls, enforcement actions, including injunctive relief or consent decrees, or other consequences, such as the Warning Letter, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the FDA audits compliance with the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections of manufacturing and other facilities. Any failure to comply with applicable statutes and regulations administered by the FDA, or the failure to timely and adequately respond to any adverse inspection observations or product safety issues, could result in any of the following enforcement actions:\n\u2022untitled letters, warning letters, such as the Warning Letter, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u2022unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions;\n\u2022customer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, detention or seizure of our products;\n\u2022operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022refusing or delaying our requests for regulatory approvals or clearances of new products or modified products;\n\u2022refusal to grant export approval for our products; or\n\u2022criminal prosecution.\nAny of these sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, which could result in a failure to produce our products on a timely basis and in the required quantities, if at all.\nOur products and operations are required to comply with standards set by foreign regulatory bodies, and those standards, types of evaluation and scope of review differ among foreign regulatory bodies. If we fail to comply with any of these standards adequately or if changes to our manufacturing or supply practices require additional regulatory approval, a foreign regulatory body may take adverse actions or cause delays within their jurisdiction similar to those within the power of the FDA. Any such action or circumstance may harm our reputation and business, and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOn June 26, 2020, we received a Warning Letter from the FDA relating to the operations of our Austin, Texas and Northbrook, Illinois facilities and our VERIGENE Processor SP System. The Warning Letter resulted from inspections held at the Facilities from February 10, 2020 to February 14, 2020. The Warning Letter primarily relates to the Company\u2019s VERIGENE SP instrument and its hybridization heater. We timely submitted a response to the FDA regarding the issues raised in the Warning Letter and are working diligently and expeditiously to resolve the issues raised by the FDA. The Warning Letter does not restrict the manufacture, production or shipment of any of the Company\u2019s products, nor require the withdrawal of any product from the marketplace. The Company believes it is taking appropriate measures to address the items identified by the FDA with respect to the VERIGENE SP instrument and its hybridization heater, and the Company included communication of these measures in its response to the Warning Letter.\nThe Company has responded to the FDA\u2019s concerns raised in the Warning Letter, but cannot give assurances that the FDA will be satisfied with its response to the Warning Letter or that such response will resolve the issues identified in the Warning Letter. Failure to promptly and fully address the issues raised in the Warning Letter to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction or to comply with U.S. medical device regulatory requirements in general could result in further regulatory and enforcement actions being initiated by the FDA. These actions could result in, among other things, product recalls, product seizures, injunctions, civil monetary penalties, delays in obtaining marketing authorization for products, an impact on federal contracts, limitations on our ability to export products, and criminal enforcement action. Any such actions could disrupt our ongoing business and operations and potentially have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we may be required to conduct costly post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or effectiveness of our products in the EEA. We must comply with medical device reporting requirements, including the reporting of adverse events and malfunctions related to our products. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, manufacturing problems, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in changes to labeling, restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of the products from the market, voluntary or mandatory recalls, a requirement to repair, replace or refund the cost of any medical device we manufacture or distribute, fines, suspension of regulatory clearances or approvals, product seizures, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties which would adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nModifications to our marketed products may require new 510(k) or de novo clearances or PMA approvals or equivalent steps in third countries, including the EEA, or may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified products until clearances or approvals are obtained.\nModifications to our products may require new regulatory approvals or clearances, including 510(k) or de novo clearances or premarket approvals, or require us to recall or cease marketing the modified devices until these clearances or approvals are obtained. The FDA requires device manufacturers to initially make and document a determination of whether or not a modification requires a new approval, supplement or clearance. For example, a manufacturer may determine that a modification does not significantly affect safety or efficacy and does not represent a major change in its intended use, so that no new 510(k) clearance is necessary. However, the FDA can review a manufacturer\u2019s decision and may disagree. The FDA may also on its own initiative determine that a new clearance or approval is required. We have made modifications to our products in the past and may make additional modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require additional clearances or approvals. If the FDA disagrees and requires new clearances or approvals for the modifications, we may be required to recall or to stop marketing our products as modified, which could require us to redesign our products and harm our operating results. In these circumstances, we may be subject to significant enforcement actions.\nFor those products sold in the EEA, we must notify our EU notified body if significant changes are made to the products or if there are substantial changes to our quality assurance systems affecting those products. Obtaining certification can be a time-consuming process, and delays in obtaining required future clearances or approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our future growth.\nIf our products contribute to a death or a serious injury, or malfunction in certain ways, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions.\nUnder the FDA medical device reporting regulations, medical device manufacturers are required to report to the FDA information that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device were to recur. As required per the FDA Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR) Part 803, we have established procedures and processes for documentation and evaluation of all complaints relative to reporting requirements. As with all device manufacturers, we have 30 days from \u201cbecoming aware\u201d of an incident to submit to the FDA a medical device report for an event that reasonably suggests that a device has or may have caused or contributed to the incident, or five working days for an event designated by FDA or an event that requires remedial action to prevent an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public health. If we fail to report these events to the FDA within the required timeframes, or at all, the FDA could take enforcement action against us. Any adverse event involving our products also could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, would require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nAll manufacturers placing medical devices on the market in the EEA are legally bound to report incidents involving devices they produce or sell to the regulatory agency, or Competent Authority, in whose jurisdiction the incident occurred. Under the IVDD an incident is defined as any malfunction, failure or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, as well as any inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which, directly or indirectly, might lead to or might have led to the death of a patient, or user or of other persons or to a serious deterioration in their state of health; any technical or medical reason in relation to the characteristics or performance of a device for the reasons referred to above, leading to systematic recall of devices of the same type by the manufacturer.\nMalfunction of our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls, including corrections, or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement actions. If malfunctions do occur, we may be unable to correct the malfunctions adequately or prevent further malfunctions, in which case we may need to cease manufacture and distribution of the affected products, initiate voluntary recalls, and redesign the products. Regulatory authorities may also take actions against us, such as ordering recalls, imposing fines, or seizing the affected products. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nOur products may in the future be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation, business and financial results.\nThe FDA, Competent Authorities of EEA Member States and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. In the case of the FDA, the authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious injury or death. In addition, foreign governmental bodies have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The FDA requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the FDA within 10 working days after the recall is initiated. Competent Authorities of foreign countries impose similar deadlines. Companies are required to maintain certain records of recalls, even if they are not reportable to the FDA or to the Competent Authorities of foreign countries. We may initiate voluntary recalls involving our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, they could require us to report those actions as recalls. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales. In addition, the FDA could take enforcement action for failing to report the recalls when they were conducted.\nThe misuse or off-label use of our products may harm our reputation or the image of our test kits in the marketplace, or result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business. Moreover, we could be subject to FDA sanctions if we are deemed to have engaged in off-label promotion.\nOur promotional materials and training methods must comply with FDA and other applicable laws and regulations, including the prohibition on the promotion of a medical device for an indication that has not been approved or cleared by the FDA, referred to as an off-label use. The FDA does not restrict or regulate a physician\u2019s use of a medical device within the practice of medicine, and we cannot prevent a physician from using our test kits for an off-label use. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials constitute the unlawful promotion of an off-label use, it could subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including additional civil money penalties, criminal fines and penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal health programs, among others. Other federal, state or foreign governmental authorities might also take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities. In that event, our reputation could be damaged and the use of our products in the marketplace could be impaired.\nFurthermore, the use of our products for indications other than those that have been approved or cleared by the FDA may lead to performance issues or produce erroneous results, which could harm our reputation in the marketplace among physicians and patients and increase the risk of product liability. Product liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert our management\u2019s attention from our primary business and result in substantial damage awards against us. Any of these events could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe advertising and promotion of our products in the EEA is subject to EEA Member States\u2019 national laws implementing the IVDD and, in the future, applying the IVDR Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising, and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, as well as other national legislation of individual EEA Member States governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. EEA member state legislation may also restrict or impose limitations on our ability to advertise our products directly to the general public. In addition, voluntary EU and national Codes of Conduct provide guidelines on the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals.\nClinical trials necessary to support future product submissions will be expensive and may require the enrollment of large numbers of subjects, and suitable subjects may be difficult to identify and recruit. Delays or failures in our clinical trials will prevent us from commercializing any modified or new test kits and will adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nInitiating and completing clinical trials necessary to support a future EUA, 510(k), PMA, or de novo submission, will be time consuming and expensive and the outcome uncertain. Moreover, the results of early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, and any test kit we advance into clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials.\nConducting successful clinical trials will require the enrollment of large numbers of subjects, and suitable subjects may be difficult to identify and recruit. Subject enrollment in clinical trials and completion of subject participation depends on many factors, including the nature of the trial protocol, the attractiveness of, or the discomforts and risks associated with, the indication of the underlying test kit, the availability of appropriate clinical trial investigators, support staff, and proximity of subjects to clinical sites and ability to comply with the eligibility and exclusion criteria for participation in the clinical trial and subject compliance. In addition, subjects may not participate in our clinical trials if they choose to participate in contemporaneous clinical trials of competitive products.\nIn addition, our clinical trials may in the future be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We are unable to predict with confidence the duration of such potential subject enrollment delays and difficulties, whether related to COVID-19 or otherwise. Delays in subject enrollment or failure of subjects to continue to participate in a clinical trial may cause an increase in costs and delays in the approval and attempted commercialization of our test kits or result in the failure of the clinical trial.\nDevelopment of sufficient and appropriate clinical protocols to demonstrate safety and efficacy are required and we may not adequately develop such protocols to support clearance and approval. Further, the FDA may require us to submit data on a greater number of subjects than we originally anticipated and/or for a longer follow-up period or change the data collection requirements or data analysis applicable to our clinical trials. In addition, despite considerable time and expense invested in our clinical trials, the FDA may not consider our data adequate for approval. Such increased costs and delays or failures could adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nEven if our products are approved or cleared in the United States and CE marked in the EEA, comparable regulatory authorities of additional foreign countries must also approve the manufacturing and marketing of our products in those countries. Approval and clearance procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the United States or the EEA, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nU.S. legislative, FDA or global regulatory reforms may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates and to manufacture, market and distribute our products after approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory approval, manufacture and marketing of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of future products. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.\nMoreover, leadership, personnel and structural changes within the FDA as well as recent and future federal election outcomes could result in significant legislative and regulatory reforms impacting the FDA\u2019s regulation of our products. Any change in the laws, regulations or policies that govern the clearance and approval processes relating to our current and future products could make it more difficult and costly to obtain clearance or approval for new products, or to produce, market and distribute existing products. Significant delays in receiving clearance or approval, or the failure to receive clearance or approval, for our new products would have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business.\nIn addition, on May 25, 2017, the new MDR entered into force for medical devices marketed in the EU. Implementation of the MDR was delayed by one year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following its entry into application in May, 2021, the MDR will introduce substantial changes to the obligations with which medical device manufacturers must comply in the EU. High risk medical devices will be subject to additional scrutiny during the conformity assessment procedure. Specifically, the MDR repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the European Economic Area (EEA) Member States, the regulations would be directly applicable, i.e., without the need for adoption of EEA Member State laws implementing them, in all EEA Member States and are intended to eliminate current differences in regulation of medical devices among EEA Member States. The MDR, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices to ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. The MDR will enter into application on May 26, 2021. Once applicable, the new regulation will among other things:\n\u2022strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;\n\u2022establish explicit provisions on manufacturers\u2019 responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;\n\u2022improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;\n\u2022set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and\n\u2022strengthen rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.\nThe MDR imposes a number of new requirements on manufacturers of medical devices. It will be necessary for notified bodies to be accredited by the EU Member States' accreditation bodies to conduct assessment procedures for medical devices in accordance with the Regulation. There are currently a relatively small number of notified bodies that have been accredited to conduct these assessments. This may delay conformity assessment procedures in the future in the EU. This may impact our activities in the EEA and the UK, the renewal of our existing CE Certificates of Conformity and conformity assessment related to future bodies.\nOnce applicable, the MDR may impose increased compliance obligations for us to access the EU market.\nIn April 2017, the EU Regulation on In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices (Regulation (EU) 2017/746) (IVDR) was adopted. The IVDR repeals and replaces Directive 98/79/EC, the IVDD. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the individual EU Member States, the IVDR will be directly applicable in the EU Member States and on the basis of the EEA agreement in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The IVDR is, among other things, intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for in vitro diagnostic medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. The IVDR will apply beginning on May 26, 2022. Once applicable, the IVDR will introduce new classification rules for in vitro diagnostic medical devices and new regulatory requirements. The IVDR will also impose increased compliance obligations for manufacturers of in vitro diagnostic medical devices to access the EEA market. Moreover, the scrutiny imposed by notified bodies for the technical documentation related these devices will increase considerably. Complying with the requirements of this regulation may require us to incur significant expenditures.\nIn order to continue to sell our products in the EEA, we must maintain our CE marks and continue to comply with certain EU directives and, beginning in May 2021, with the MDR.\nOur failure to continue to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, including those administered by authorities of the EEA countries, could result in enforcement actions against us, including refusal, suspension, variation or withdrawal of our CE Certificates of Conformity by our EU notified body, which could impair our ability to market products in the EEA in the future. Any changes to the membership of the EU, such as the recent departure of the United Kingdom (Brexit), may impact the regulatory requirements for the impacted countries and impair our business operations and our ability to market products in such countries.\nThe UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as Brexit, has created significant uncertainty concerning the future relationship between the UK and the EU. On December 24, 2020, the EU and UK reached an agreement in principle on the framework for their future relationship, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The Agreement primarily focuses on ensuring free trade between the EU and the UK in relation to goods. The Agreement does not however, specifically address medical devices. The Agreement seeks to ensure that the parties ensure \u201cregulatory cooperation.\u201d Among the changes that will now occur are that Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) will be treated as a third country. Northern Ireland will, with regard to EU regulations, continue to follow the EU regulatory rules. In light of the fact that the CE marking process is set out in EU law, which no longer applies in the UK, the UK has devised a new route to market culminating in a UK Conformity Assessed (UKCA) mark to replace the CE mark. Northern Ireland will, however, continue to be covered by the regulations governing CE marks. As part of the Agreement, the EU and the UK have agreed to continue to recognize declarations of conformity based on a self-assessment in the other territory.\nGiven the lack of comparable precedent to Brexit, it is unclear what the financial, regulatory, and legal implications of Brexit will be and how it will affect us. However, potentially changing regulatory schemes and tariffs engendered by Brexit may add additional complexity, cost and delays in marketing or selling our products in the United Kingdom. Our revenue and profit, supply and demand for our products, and customer retention and acquisition in both the long-term and short-term could be adversely affected.\nIf the governmental laws and regulations change in ways that we do not anticipate or if we fail to comply with existing laws and regulations that affect our business, we could be subject to enforcement actions, injunctions and civil and criminal penalties or otherwise be subject to increased costs that could delay or prevent marketing of our products.\nMedical device laws and regulations are in effect within the United States and also in many countries outside the United States. These range from comprehensive device clearance requirements for some or all of our medical device products to requests for product data or certifications regarding the hazardous material content of our products. As a device manufacturer, we are required to report annually to the CMS any payments or transfers of value we have made to physicians and teaching hospitals and any physician ownership or investment interest in the company. This data is published in a publicly searchable database. As part of the European Council Directive 2002/96 of February 13, 2003, we are expected to comply with certain requirements regarding the collection, recycling and labeling of our products containing electronic devices in each of the EU Member States where our regulated products are distributed. While we are taking steps to comply with the requirements of WEEE, we cannot be certain that we will comply with the national stage implementation of WEEE in all Member States. We continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted. These regulations include, for example, the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical substances Regulation (REACH), the RoHS Directive and the WEEE Directive enacted in the EU, which regulate the use of certain chemical substance and hazardous substances in, and require the collection, reuse and recycling of waste from, certain products we manufacture. This and similar legislation that has been or is in the process of being enacted in various countries may require us to redesign our products to ensure compliance with the applicable standards. These redesigns may impact the performance of our products, add greater testing lead times for product introductions or have other similar effects. We believe we comply with all such legislation where our products are sold and we will continue to monitor these laws and the regulations being adopted under them to determine our responsibilities. In addition, the State of California adopted the Electronic Waste Recycling Act, effective January 1, 2007, which requires the California Department of Toxic Substances Control to adopt regulations to prohibit the sale of electronic devices in California if they are also prohibited from sale in the EU under the RoHS Directive because they contain certain heavy metals. The number and scope of these requirements are increasing and we will likely become subject to similar laws in other jurisdictions. Failure to comply with applicable federal, state and foreign medical device laws and regulations may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are also subject to a variety of other laws and regulations relating to, among other things, environmental protection and workplace health and safety.\nOur strategic partners and customers expect our organization to operate on an established quality management system compliant with FDA Quality System Regulations and industry standards, the In Vitro Diagnostic Directive 98/79/EC of 27 October 1998 (Directive) as implemented nationally in the EU Member States and industry standards, such as ISO 9000. We became ISO 9001:2000 certified in March 2002 and issued a Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment for our Luminex 100/200, FLEXMAP 3D and MAGPIX instruments. Our devices are in conformity with Article 1, Article 9, Annex I (Essential Requirements), Annex III and the additional provisions of the Directive as of December 7, 2003. Subsequent audits are carried out annually to ensure we maintain our system in substantial compliance with ISO and other applicable regulations and industry standards. We became ISO 13485:2003 and Canadian Medical Devices Conformity Assessment System (CMDCAS) certified in July 2005. Failure to maintain compliance with FDA, CMDCAS and EU regulations and other medical device laws, or to obtain applicable registrations, where required, could reduce our competitive position in the markets in which we compete and also decrease satisfaction and confidence levels with our partners.\nIn addition, our operations in the United States are subject to federal, state, and local laws addressing, among other issues, fraud and abuse, privacy and security, and environmental protection. These laws may impact our operations directly or indirectly through our customers and may affect, for example, our sales and marketing programs. We are also subject to laws in foreign jurisdictions, including those that prohibit commercial bribery and certain activities with customers or potential customers. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to criminal penalties and civil sanctions, including restrictions on our ability to contract with Medicare and Medicaid providers. Evolving interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes to our operations. For further discussion of these matters, see \u201cGovernment Regulation - Other Government Regulations\u201d in Part I of this Form 10-K.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends.\nIn February 2017, the Board of Directors initiated a cash dividend program under which the Company will pay a regular quarterly cash dividend. The declaration, amount and timing of such dividends are subject to capital availability and determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and our agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends. Our continuing ability to pay dividends will depend upon, among other factors, our cash balances and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions, debt service requirements, results of operations, financial condition and other factors beyond our control that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments, or our dividend program could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nOur stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in price. This volatility is in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results from historical results or estimates of results prepared by securities analysts\n\u2022announcements related to the COVID-19 pandemic and related updates on the development, commercialization, distribution and use of vaccines worldwide;\n\u2022developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation;\n\u2022new, or changes in, recommendations, guidelines or studies that could affect the use of our products;\n\u2022announcements of technological innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022announcements by us of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022developments in relationships with our partners, customers and suppliers;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022conditions or trends in the life science, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including the regulatory environment;\n\u2022published studies and reports relating to the comparative efficacy of products and markets in which we participate;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022general worldwide economic conditions and interest rates;\n\u2022the success or lack of success of integrating our acquisitions;\n\u2022instability in the United States and other financial markets, including, but not limited to, effects resulting from the 2020 elections in the United States, and the ongoing and possible escalation of unrest internationally, other armed hostilities or further acts or threats of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u2022sales of our common stock; and\n\u25e6the potential adverse impact of the secondary trading of our stock on foreign exchanges, without our permission, which exchanges are subject to less regulatory oversight than the Nasdaq Global Select Market, and the activity of the market makers of our stock on such exchanges, including the risk that such market makers may engage in naked short sales and/or other deceptive trading practices which may artificially depress or otherwise affect the price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the Nasdaq Global Select Market and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Further, there has been particular volatility in the market prices of securities of life sciences companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs, potential liabilities and the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could make a third party acquisition of us difficult.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. We are also subject to certain provisions of Delaware law that could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of us. These provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nRisk Factors Relating to our Notes\nWe have incurred substantial indebtedness that may decrease our business flexibility, access to capital, and/or increase our borrowing costs, which may adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nOn May 13, 2020, we issued $260.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.00% Notes due 2025. Holders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, the indenture for the Notes provides that we are required to repay amounts due under the indenture in the event that there is an event of default for the Notes that results in the principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, becoming due prior to maturity date for the Notes. Our indebtedness may:\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes\u037e\n\u2022limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes\u037e\n\u2022require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments\u037e\n\u2022limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry\u037e\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors\u037e and\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nFurther, the indenture governing the Notes does not restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in any future debt instruments existing at the time, some of which may be secured indebtedness.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary for cash or combination settlement upon conversion of the Notes or to repurchase the Notes for cash upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion of the Notes or to repurchase the Notes.\nHolders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. In addition, upon conversion of the Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Notes surrendered therefor or Notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture governing the Notes or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Notes as required by such indenture would constitute a default under such indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nThe conditional conversion features of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion features of the Notes is triggered, holders of Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (ASC 470-20), an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the Notes that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date, and the value of the equity component is treated as debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Notes. As a result, we are required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Notes to their face amount over the respective terms of the Notes. We report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest rate, which could adversely affect our future financial results, the trading price of our common stock or the Trading Price of the Notes. In addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued guidance that changes the accounting for the convertible debt instruments described above. Under the new guidance, an entity will no longer be required to separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments. This is expected to reduce non-cash interest expense, thereby increasing net income after adoption of the new guidance. Additionally, the treasury stock method for calculating earnings per share will no longer be allowed for convertible debt instruments whose principal amount may be settled using shares. Rather, the if-converted method will be required. Application of the \u201cif-converted\u201d method may reduce our reported diluted earnings per share. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than January 1, 2021. The Company will early adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2021 under the modified retrospective basis with the cumulative effect recognized through an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. Under this method, earnings per share amounts will not be restated in prior periods presented, but future earnings per share amounts will be impacted by the change to the if-converted method for calculating diluted earnings per share. The Company's adoption is expected to result in a decrease of approximately $42 million in additional paid in capital from the de-recognition of the bifurcated equity component and an increase of approximately $50 million in debt from the de-recognition of the discount associated with the bifurcated equity component. The Company expects to write-off the related deferred tax liabilities to additional paid in capital.\nThe Convertible Note Hedge and Warrant Transactions may affect the value of the Notes and our common stock.\nIn connection with the pricing of the Notes, we entered into Convertible Note Hedge Transactions with the option counterparties. We also entered into Warrant Transactions with the option counterparties pursuant to which we will sell Warrants for the purchase of our common stock. The Convertible Note Hedge Transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential equity dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the Notes and/or offset any potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be. However, the Warrant Transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the Warrants unless, subject to the terms of the Warrant Transactions, we elect to cash settle instead of net share settle the Warrants.\nIn connection with establishing their initial hedges of the convertible note hedge and Warrant Transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to purchase shares of our common stock and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Notes. These activities could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of our common stock or the Notes at that time.\nIn addition, the option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Notes and prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so following any conversion of the Notes or during any observation period related to a conversion of notes). These activities could also cause a decrease, or avoid an increase, in the market price of our common stock or the Notes, which could affect the note holder\u2019s ability to convert the Notes and, to the extent the activity occurs following conversion or during any observation period related to a conversion of Notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that a note holder will receive upon conversion of such Notes.\nIn addition, if any such convertible note hedge and Warrant Transaction fails to become effective, the option counterparty thereto or its respective affiliate may unwind its hedge positions with respect to our common stock, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the value of the Notes.\nThe potential effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the Notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock or the value of the Notes (and as a result, the value of the consideration, the amount of cash and/or the number of shares of common stock, if any, that a note holder would receive upon the conversion of any Notes) and, under certain circumstances, their ability to convert their Notes.\nThe Convertible Note Hedge Transactions and the Warrant Transactions are separate transactions (in each case that we entered into with the option counterparties), are not part of the terms of the Notes and will not change the holders\u2019 rights under the Notes. A holder of the Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions or the Warrant Transactions.\nWe do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes or our common stock. In addition, we do not make any representation that the option counterparties will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions.\nThe option counterparties are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them might default under the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. Past global economic conditions from time to time have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions, including the bankruptcy filing by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and its various affiliates. If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions with such option counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.\nTo the extent we choose to deliver shares upon conversion of the Notes, the ownership interests of existing stockholders will be diluted and our stock price may be adversely impacted.\nUpon conversion of the Notes, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. To the extent we choose to deliver shares upon conversion of some or all of the Notes, this will result in a dilution to the ownership interests of existing stockholders and may depress our stock price.\nCertain provisions in the indentures governing the Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.\nCertain provisions in the indentures governing the Notes may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, the indentures governing the Notes will require us to repurchase the Notes for cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the relevant indenture governing the Notes) of us and, in certain circumstances, to increase the conversion rate for a holder that converts the Notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change. A takeover of us may trigger the requirement that we repurchase the Notes, and/or increase the conversion rate, which could make it more costly for a potential acquirer to engage in such takeover. Such additional costs may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of us that would otherwise be beneficial to investors.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur success depends partly on our ability to operate without infringing on or misappropriating the proprietary rights of others.\nWe have been (and from time to time we may be) notified that third parties consider their patents or other intellectual property relevant to our products. We may be sued for infringing the intellectual property rights of others, including claims with respect to intellectual property of entities we may acquire. In addition, we may find it necessary, if threatened, to initiate a lawsuit seeking a declaration from a court that we do not infringe on the proprietary rights of others or that their rights are invalid or unenforceable. Intellectual property litigation is costly, and, even if we prevail, the cost of such litigation could affect our profitability. Furthermore, litigation is time-consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from our business. If we do not prevail in any litigation, we may have to pay damages and could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license. Any required license may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Moreover, some licenses may be nonexclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent, we may be unable to sell some of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe require collaboration with other organizations in obtaining relevant biomarkers, and access to oligonucleotides and enzymes that are patented or controlled by others. If we cannot continue to obtain these items or identify freedom to operate opportunities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nSecurity breaches, including with respect to cybersecurity, and other disruptions could compromise our information, products, and services and expose us to liability and harm our reputation and business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, personal information, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in our data centers and on our networks. The secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and domestically available monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing this sensitive data. As a participant in the molecular diagnostic market, we may face cyber-attacks that attempt to penetrate our network security, including our data centers, sabotage or otherwise disable our research, products and services (including instruments at our customers\u2019 sites, which may include personally identifiable information) or cause interruptions of our internal systems.\nFurthermore, there are a variety of other state, national, foreign, and international laws and regulations that apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, security, disclosure, transfer, and other processing of personal data. California has passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), which took effect January 1, 2020. The CCPA applies broadly to information that identifies or is associated with any California household or individual, and compliance with the CCPA requires that we implement several operational changes, including processes to respond to individuals\u2019 data access and deletion requests. In addition, many foreign data privacy regulations (including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective in the European Union on May 25, 2018), can be more stringent than those in the United States. Each of the GDPR and the CCPA confer a private right of action on certain individuals and associations. These laws and regulations are rapidly evolving and changing, and could have an adverse effect on our operations. The costs of compliance with, and the other burdens imposed by, these and other laws and regulatory actions may increase our operational costs.\nIf successful, hackers may misappropriate personal or confidential business information. In addition, an associate, contractor or other third party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information, and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information due to items such as business email compromise. We may be at increased risk if we outsource certain services or functions of our business or otherwise rely on third parties to store and use portions of sensitive data. A break or attack affecting any of these third parties could harm our business.\nWhile we continue to implement additional protective measures to reduce the risk of, and to detect, cyber incidents, cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent, and the techniques used in such attacks change rapidly. Despite our cybersecurity measures (including employee and third-party training, monitoring of networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems) which are continuously reviewed and upgraded, the Company\u2019s information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. Any such compromise of our, or our third-party IT service providers\u2019, data security and any access, unauthorized use, public disclosure or loss of personal or confidential business information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, monetary losses, disruption of our operations, damage to our reputation or customers\u2019 willingness to transact business with us and subject us to additional costs and liabilities, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends on building and sustaining our technology infrastructure.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology to enable us to improve the effectiveness of our operations and to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build, implement and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, the inability to properly support and service our customers, processing inefficiencies, loss of customers, business disruptions or loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach or cyber-attack, each of which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nUncertain economic conditions and outlook may adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nGlobal economic conditions, including, but not limited to, effects resulting from the 2020 elections in the United States and from the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our results of operations. The credit markets and the financial services industry continue to experience volatility, both domestically and internationally. These conditions not only limit our access to capital but also make it extremely difficult for our customers, our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and they could cause U.S. and foreign businesses and consumers to slow spending on our products and services, which would delay and lengthen sales cycles. Some of our customers rely on government research grants to fund technology purchases. If negative trends in the economy affect the government\u2019s allocation of funds to research, there may be less grant funding available for certain of our customers to purchase technologies like those Luminex sells. Certain of our partners and their and our customers may face challenges gaining timely access to sufficient credit or may otherwise be faced with budget constraints, which could result in decreased purchases of, or development of products based on, our products or in an impairment of their ability to make timely payments to us. If our partners and our customers do not make timely payments to us, we may be required to assume greater credit risk relating to those customers, increase our allowance for doubtful accounts and our days sales outstanding would be negatively impacted. Although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments, and such losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, we may not continue to experience the same loss rates that we have in the past given the current condition of the worldwide economy. Additionally, these economic conditions and market turbulence may also impact our suppliers, causing them to be unable to supply sufficient quantities of customized components in a timely manner, thereby impairing our ability to manufacture on schedule and at commercially reasonable costs.\nOur operations in foreign countries expose us to certain risks inherent in doing business internationally, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe expect that revenue from U.S. sales will continue to represent the majority of our total revenue, but our future profitability will depend in part on our ability to grow and ultimately maintain our product sales in foreign markets, particularly in Asia and Europe. In 2020, approximately 22% of our revenue was derived from sales to non-U.S. customers, with approximately 12% of revenue from sales to customers in Europe and approximately 7% of revenue from sales to customers in Asia. Continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential long-term and wide-spread recession and geopolitical issues have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for economic growth around the world. Uncertainty about global economic conditions, particularly in emerging markets and countries with government-sponsored healthcare systems, may cause decreased demand for our products and services and increased competition, which could result in lower sales volume and downward pressure on the prices for our products, longer sales cycles, and slower adoption of new technologies. As such, a significant slowdown in these foreign economies or lower investments in new infrastructure could have a negative impact on our sales. We also purchase a portion of the materials included in our products from overseas sources. A weakening of macroeconomic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers, which could result in interruptions in supply. As a result of acquisitions and organic growth, we have operations and manufacturing facilities in foreign countries that expose us to certain risks. For example, fluctuations in exchange rates may affect our revenues, expenses and results of operations, as well as the value of our assets and liabilities as reflected in our financial statements. We are also subject to other types of risks, including the following:\n\u2022changes in or interpretations of foreign law that may adversely affect our ability to sell our products, perform services or repatriate profits to the United States;\n\u2022tariffs, customs and other barriers to importing/exporting materials and products in a cost-effective and timely manner;\n\u2022hyperinflation or economic or political instability in foreign countries;\n\u2022imposition of limitations on or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries;\n\u2022conducting business in places where business practices and customs are unfamiliar and unknown;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022the burden of complying with complex and changing foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u2022difficulties in accounts receivable collections;\n\u2022the imposition of restrictive trade policies, including export restrictions;\n\u2022worldwide political conditions;\n\u2022the imposition of inconsistent laws or regulations;\n\u2022reduced protection of intellectual property rights and trade secrets in some foreign countries;\n\u2022the imposition or increase of investment requirements and other restrictions by foreign governments;\n\u2022the interpretation of contractual provisions governed by foreign laws in the event of a contract dispute;\n\u2022uncertainties relating to foreign laws, including labor laws, and legal proceedings;\n\u2022the burden of complying with foreign and international laws and treaties;\n\u2022significant currency fluctuations;\n\u2022the burden of complying with and changes in international taxation policies;\n\u2022the burden of complying with a variety of U.S. laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022the burden of complying with U.S. export control regulations and policies that restrict our ability to communicate with non-U.S. employees and to supply foreign affiliates, partners and customers; and\n\u2022the burden of complying with applicable international laws governing privacy and data security, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation.\nOur international sales and purchases are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, tariffs, trade barriers, regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, the International Traffic in Arms Regulation promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be liable for administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, and in the extreme case, we could be suspended or debarred from government contracts or have our export privileges suspended, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in policy in the U.S. and other countries regarding international trade, including import and export regulation and international trade agreements, could also negatively impact our business. In 2018, 2019 and 2020 the U.S. imposed tariffs on goods imported from China and certain other countries, which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by China and other countries. Additional tariffs or further retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response, could affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products, prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nInternational sales and purchases are also subject to a variety of other risks, including risks arising from currency fluctuations, collection issues and taxes. Our international sales are subject to variability as our selling prices become less competitive in countries with currencies that are declining in value against the U.S. dollar and more competitive in countries with currencies that are increasing in value against the U.S. dollar. In addition, our international purchases can become more expensive if the U.S. dollar weakens against the foreign currencies in which we are billed. We have not entered into any foreign currency derivative financial instruments; however, we may choose to do so in the future in an effort to manage or hedge our foreign exchange rate risk.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain our management and staff.\nWe depend on the principal members of our management and scientific staff, including our chief executive officer, Nachum Shamir, and our operations, marketing, research and development, technical support, technical service and sales staff. The loss of services of key members of management could delay or reduce our product development, marketing and sales and technical support efforts. In addition, recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and other personnel to perform research and development, technical support, technical service and marketing and sales work will be critical to our success. There is a shortage in our industry of qualified management and scientific personnel, and competition for these individuals is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain existing and attract additional personnel necessary to achieve our business objectives.\nOur effective tax rate may fluctuate and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of amounts that have been accrued.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country, the establishment or release of valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, and changes in tax laws. In addition, we have recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits in our financial statements that, if recognized, would impact our effective tax rate. We are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions, including the United States, and tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. There can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the actual outcomes could have a material impact on our net income or financial condition. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The recognition of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will not be realized. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical income, projected future income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax-planning strategies.\nIf we become subject to product liability claims, we may be required to pay damages that exceed our insurance coverage.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the testing, production, marketing and sale of biotechnological, human diagnostic and therapeutic products. Although we believe that we are reasonably insured against these risks and we generally have limited indemnity protections in our supplier agreements, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain insurance in amounts or scope sufficient to provide us with adequate coverage against all potential liabilities. A product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage or a claim that is outside of or exceeds our indemnity protections in our supplier agreements or a recall of one of our products would have to be paid out of our cash reserves.\nIf we become subject to claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of hazardous materials, we could incur significant cost and time to comply.\nOur research and development processes involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials, including biological hazardous materials. We are subject to foreign, federal, state and local regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of materials and waste products. We may incur significant costs complying with both existing and future environmental laws and regulations. In particular, we are subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and to regulation under the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in the United States. OSHA or the EPA may adopt regulations that may affect our research and development programs. We are unable to predict whether any agency will adopt any regulations that would have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nThe risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous materials cannot be eliminated completely. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and any liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the coverage of our workers\u2019 compensation insurance. We may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe may incur impairment charges on our goodwill and intangible assets which would reduce our earnings.\nWe are subject to Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350 \u201cGoodwill and Other\u201d (ASC 350) which requires that goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite life be tested at least annually for impairment. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives must also be tested for impairment between the annual tests if a triggering event occurs that would likely reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. As of December 31, 2020, goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives represented approximately 25% of our total assets. In the future, if we determine that there has been impairment, our financial results for the relevant period would be reduced by the amount of the impairment, net of tax effects, if any.\nWe hold cash and cash equivalents at various foreign subsidiaries that may not be readily available to meet domestic\ncash requirements.\nCurrently a majority of our cash and cash equivalents is held by our U.S. parent company, however, our various foreign subsidiaries have significant cash holdings, in particular our subsidiary in Canada. These cash balances held outside the United States may not be readily available, or may not be available without an additional tax burden, to meet our domestic cash requirements. We require a substantial amount of cash in the United States for operating requirements, purchases of property and equipment, and for potential future acquisitions. If we are unable to meet our domestic cash requirements using domestic cash flows from operations, domestic cash and cash equivalents, by settling loans receivable with our foreign subsidiaries, or by domestic borrowing, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings. U.S. tax laws may allow for reductions to the potential tax burden on repatriation of foreign cash; however, such actions would require us to record additional income tax expense and remit additional taxes, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe expect our operating results to continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nThe sale of our instruments and assays typically involves a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital by us, our partners and end users. Accordingly, the sales cycle associated with our products is typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks, much of which is beyond our control, including partners\u2019 budgetary constraints, inventory management practices, regulatory approval and internal acceptance reviews. As a result of this lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle, our operating results have historically fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter. We expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future.\nThe vast majority of our system sales are made to our strategic partners. Our partners typically purchase instruments in three phases during their commercialization cycle: first, instruments necessary to support internal assay development; second, instruments for sales force demonstrations; and finally, instruments for resale to their customers. As a result, most of our system placements are highly dependent on the continued commercial success of our strategic partners and can fluctuate from quarter to quarter as our strategic partners move from phase to phase. We expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future.\nOur assays are sometimes sold to large customers. The ordering and consumption patterns of these customers can fluctuate, affecting the timing of shipments and revenue recognition. In addition, certain products assist in the diagnosis of illnesses that are seasonal, and customer orders can fluctuate for this reason. The loss of any of these customers (including LabCorp\u2019s decision to move to an alternative vendor for women\u2019s health products in 2018) has had and is expected to continue to have a material adverse effect or our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe seasonality of some of our assay offerings results in quarter to quarter fluctuations in the percentage of our quarterly revenues derived from our highest margin items (i.e., consumables, royalties and assays), as some customers make infrequent bulk purchases of $100,000 or more to address this demand. Our gross margin percentage is highly dependent upon the mix of revenue components each quarter. These fluctuations contribute to the variability and lack of predictability of both gross margin percentage and total gross profit from quarter to quarter. We expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future.\nDue to the early stage of the market for molecular tests, projected growth scenarios for our assays are highly volatile and are based on a number of underlying assumptions that may or may not prove to be valid, including our ability to be successful with our direct assay sales strategy.\nThe \u201cconflict minerals\u201d rule of the SEC has caused us to incur additional expenses, could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products, and could make us less competitive in our target markets.\nOn August 22, 2012, the SEC adopted a rule requiring disclosure of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies. The rule requires companies to obtain sourcing data from suppliers, engage in supply chain due diligence, and file annually with the SEC a specialized disclosure report. The rule could limit our ability to source at competitive prices. Within our supply chain, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the data collection and due diligence procedures that we have implemented, which may harm our reputation. Furthermore, we may encounter challenges in satisfying those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free, and if we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitor\u2019s products. We continue to investigate the presence of conflict materials within our supply chain.", "PERMNO": 87789, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "LMNX"}
