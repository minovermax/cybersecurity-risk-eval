{"cik": "716643", "company": "REGIS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-08-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe are in the process of implementing, and may further implement, a new strategy, priorities and initiatives under our recently appointed President and Chief Executive Officer, which could affect our performance and could result in an alteration of our strategy moving forward, and any inability to evolve and execute these strategies over time could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nHugh E. Sawyer became our new President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors effective as of April 17, 2017. The transition has resulted in, and could further result in, changes in business strategy as Mr. Sawyer seeks to continue to improve the performance of company-owned salons while at the same time accelerate the growth of our franchise model. To date, we have announced that we are seeking strategic alternatives for our mall-based salons, a reorganization of our field structure by brand/concept, and implemented a 120-day plan and other initiatives, including investments in marketing and a SmartStyle mobile app, designed to improve the guest experience.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to grow our franchise model. We announced plans in fall 2016 to expand the franchise side of our business, including by selling certain company-owned salons to franchisees over time. In January\n2017, we began franchising the SmartStyle brand throughout the U.S. for the first time, and during the second half of fiscal 2017, we entered into agreements to sell 233 of our company-owned salons across our brands to new and existing franchisees. This initiative is still in an early stage. It will take time to execute, and we may not be able to effectively do so. Furthermore, it may create additional costs, expose us to additional legal and compliance risks, cause disruption to our current business and impact our short-term operating results.\nOur success also depends, in part, on our ability to improve sales, as well as both cost of service and product and operating margins at our company-owned salons. Same-store sales are affected by average ticket and same-store guest visits. A variety of factors affect same-store guest visits, including the guest experience, staffing and retention of stylists and salon leaders, price competition, fashion trends, competition, current economic conditions, product assortment, customer traffic at Walmart where our SmartStyle locations reside, marketing programs and weather conditions. These factors may cause our same-store sales to differ materially from prior periods and from our expectations.\nIn addition to a new President and Chief Executive Officer, since May we have appointed a new President of Franchise, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer, Vice President of Walmart Relations and Vice President Creative, and over the next fiscal year we may add personnel in a number of key positions, which may further result in new strategies, priorities and initiatives. The process of implementing any new strategies, priorities and initiatives involves inherent risks and the changes we implement could harm our relationships with customers, suppliers, employees or other third parties and may be disruptive to our business. While we believe the pursuit of these changes will have a positive effect on our business in the long term, we cannot provide assurance that these changes will lead to the desired results. If we do not effectively and successfully execute on these changes, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIt is important for us to attract, train and retain talented stylists and salon leaders.\nGuest loyalty is dependent upon the stylists who serve our guests. Great stylists are a key to a great guest experience that creates loyal customers. In order to profitably grow our business, it is important for us to attract, train and retain talented stylists and salon leaders and to adequately staff our salons. Because the salon industry is highly fragmented and comprised of many independent operators, the market for stylists is highly competitive. In addition, increases in minimum wage requirements may impact the number of stylists considering careers outside the beauty industry. In some markets, we have experienced a shortage of qualified stylists. Offering competitive wages, benefits, education and training programs are important elements to attracting and retaining great stylists. In addition, due to challenges facing the for-profit education industry, cosmetology schools, including our joint venture EEG, have experienced declines in enrollment, revenues and profitability in recent years. If the cosmetology school industry sustains further declines in enrollment or some schools close entirely, or if stylists leave the beauty industry, we expect that we would have increased difficulty staffing our salons in some markets. If we are not successful in attracting, training and retaining stylists or in staffing our salons, our same-store sales could experience periods of variability or sales could decline and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur continued success depends in part on the success of our franchisees, who operate independently.\nAs of June 30, 2017, approximately 29% of our salons were franchised locations and we intend to expand our number of franchised locations. We derive revenues associated with our franchised locations from royalties, service fees and product sales to franchised locations. Our financial results are therefore dependent in part upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees. As we increase our focus on our franchise business, our dependence on our franchisees grows.\nWe have limited control over how our franchisees\u2019 businesses are run. Though we have established operational standards and guidelines, they own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their salon locations. If franchisees do not successfully operate their salons in compliance with our standards, our brand reputation and image could be harmed and our financial results could be affected. We could experience greater risks as the scale of our franchise owners increases. Further, some franchise owners may not successfully execute the turnaround of under-performing salons which we have transferred to them.\nIn addition, our franchisees are subject to the same general economic risks as our Company, and their results are influenced by competition for both guests and stylists, market trends, price competition and disruptions in their markets due to severe weather and other external events. Like us, they rely on external vendors for some critical functions and to protect their company data. They may also be limited in their ability to open new locations by an inability to secure adequate financing, especially since many of them are small businesses with much more limited access to financing than our Company, or by the limited supply of favorable real estate for new salon locations. They may experience financial distress as a result of over-leveraging, which could negatively affect our operating results as a result of delayed payments to us. The bankruptcy of a franchisee could also expose us to liability under leases, which are generally sub-leased by us to our franchisees.\nA deterioration in the financial results of our franchisees, or a failure of our franchisees to renew their franchise agreements, could adversely affect our operating results through decreased royalty payments, fees and product revenues.\nAcceleration of the sale of certain company-owned salons to franchisees may not improve our operating results and could cause operational difficulties.\nDuring fiscal 2017, we accelerated the sale of company-owned salons to new and existing franchisees. Specifically, in January 2017, we began offering SmartStyle franchises for the first time, and during fiscal 2017 we entered into agreements to refranchise 233 salons across our brands.\nSuccess will depend on a number of factors, including franchisees\u2019 ability to improve the results of the salons they purchase and their ability and interest in continuing to grow their business. We also must continue to attract qualified franchisees and work with them to make their business successful. Moving a salon from company-owned to franchise-owned is expected to reduce our consolidated revenues, increase our royalty revenue and decrease our operating costs; however, the actual benefit from a sale is uncertain and may not be sufficient to offset the loss of revenues.\nIn addition, challenges in supporting our expanding franchise system could cause our operating results to suffer. If we are unable to effectively select and train new franchisees and support and manage our growing franchisee base, it could affect our brand standards, cause disputes between us and our franchisees, and potentially lead to material liabilities.\nThe continued unit growth and operation of the SmartStyle business is completely dependent on our relationship with Walmart.\nAt June 30, 2017, we had 2,828 SmartStyle or Cost Cutters salons within Walmart locations, including 37 salons opened during fiscal year 2017 (net of relocations). Walmart is by far our largest landlord, and we are Walmart\u2019s largest tenant. Our business within each of those 2,828 salons relies primarily on the traffic of visitors to the Walmart in which it is located, so our success is tied to Walmart\u2019s success in bringing shoppers into their stores. We have limited control over the locations and markets in which we open new SmartStyles, as we only have potential opportunities in locations offered to us by Walmart. Furthermore, Walmart has the right to close up to 100 of our salons per year for any reason, upon payment of certain penalties; to terminate lease agreements for breach, such as if we failed to conform with required operating hours, subject to a notice and cure period; and to terminate the lease if the Walmart store in which it sits is closed. During fiscal year 2017, we began franchising the SmartStyle brand, with Walmart\u2019s approval. Operating both company-owned and franchised SmartStyles adds complexity in overseeing franchise compliance and coordination with Walmart.\nOur future growth and profitability may depend, in part, on our ability to build awareness and drive traffic with advertising and marketing efforts, and on delivering a quality guest experience to drive repeat visits to our salons.\nOur future growth and profitability may depend on the effectiveness, efficiency and spending levels of our marketing and advertising efforts to drive awareness and traffic to our salons. In addition, delivering a quality guest experience is crucial in order to drive repeat visits to our salons. We are developing our marketing and advertising strategies, including national and local campaigns, to build awareness, drive interest, consideration and traffic to our salons. We are also focusing on improving guest experiences to provide brand differentiation and preference, and to ensure we meet our guests\u2019 needs. If our marketing, advertising and improved guest experience efforts do not generate sufficient customer traffic and repeat visits to our salons, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nChanges in regulatory and statutory laws, such as increases in the minimum wage and changes that make collective bargaining easier, and the costs of compliance and non-compliance with such laws, may result in increased costs to our business.\nWith 9,008 locations and approximately 41,000 employees worldwide, our financial results can be adversely impacted by regulatory or statutory changes in laws. Due to the number of people we employ, laws that increase minimum wage rates, employment taxes, overtime requirements or costs to provide employee benefits or administration may result in additional costs to our Company.\nA number of U.S. states, Canadian provinces and municipalities in which we do business have recently increased or are considering increasing the minimum wage, with increases generally phased over several years depending upon the size of the employer. Increases in minimum wages and overtime pay increase our costs, and our ability to offset these increases through price increases may be limited. In fact, increases in minimum wages increased our costs over the last four years. In addition, a growing number of states, provinces, and municipalities have passed or are considering requirements for paid sick leave, family leave, predictive scheduling (which imposes penalties for changing an employee\u2019s shift as it nears), and other requirements that increase the administrative complexity of managing our workforce. Finally, changes in labor laws, such as recent legislation in Ontario and Alberta designed to facilitate union organizing, could increase the likelihood of some of our employees being\nsubjected to greater organized labor influence. If a significant portion of our employees were to become unionized, it would have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIncreases in minimum wages, administrative requirements and unionization could also have an adverse effect on the performance of our franchisees, especially if our franchisees are treated as a \"joint employer\" with us by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) or as a large employer under minimum wage statutes because of their affiliation with us. In addition, we must comply with state employment laws, including the California Labor Code, which has stringent requirements and penalties for non-compliance.\nVarious state and federal laws govern our relationship with our franchisees and our potential sale of a franchise. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be liable for damages to franchisees and fines or other penalties. A franchisee or government agency may bring legal action against us based on the franchisee/franchisor relationship. Also, under the franchise business model, we may face claims and liabilities based on vicarious liability, joint-employer liability, or other theories or liabilities. All such legal actions not only could result in changes to laws and interpretations, making it more difficult to appropriately support our franchisees and, consequently, impacting our performance, but, also, such legal actions could result in expensive litigation with our franchisees or government agencies that could adversely affect both our profits and our important relations with our franchisees. In addition, other regulatory or legal developments may result in changes to laws or the franchisor/franchisee relationship that could negatively impact the franchise business model and, accordingly, our profits.\nIn addition to employment and franchise laws, we are also subject to a wide range of federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations, including those affecting public companies, product manufacture and sale, and governing the franchisor-franchisee relationship, in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Compliance with new, complex and changing laws may cause our expenses to increase. In addition, any non-compliance with laws or regulations could result in penalties, fines, product recalls and enforcement actions or otherwise restrict our ability to market certain products or attract or retain employees, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCybersecurity incidents could result in the compromise of sensitive information about our guests, employees, vendors or company and expose us to business disruption, negative publicity, costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and our reputation could suffer.\nThe normal operations of our business involve processing, transmission and storage of personal information about our guests as well as employees, vendors and our Company. Cyber-attacks designed to gain access to sensitive information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations and their third party vendors are constantly evolving, and high profile electronic security breaches leading to unauthorized release of sensitive guest information have occurred at a number of large U.S. companies in recent years. Despite the security measures and processes we have in place, our efforts, and those of our third party vendors, to protect sensitive guest and employee information may not be successful in preventing a breach in our systems, or detecting and responding to a breach on a timely basis. As a result of a security incident or breach in our systems, our systems could be interrupted or damaged, or sensitive information could be accessed by third parties. If that happened, our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information, which could cause them to stop visiting our salons altogether. Such events could lead to lost future sales and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, as the regulatory environment relating to retailers and other companies' obligations to protect sensitive data becomes stricter, a material failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to fines or other regulatory sanctions and potentially to lawsuits. These laws are changing rapidly and vary among jurisdictions. Furthermore, while our franchisees are independently responsible for data security at franchised locations, a breach of guest or vendor data at a franchised location could also negatively affect public perception of our brands. More broadly, our incident response preparedness and disaster recovery planning efforts may be inadequate or ill-suited for a security incident and we could suffer disruption of operations or adverse effects to our operating results.\nWe rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes. If we experience an interruption in their operation, our results of operations may be affected.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on our management information systems. We rely heavily on our management information systems to collect daily sales information and guest demographics, generate payroll information, monitor salon performance, manage salon staffing and payroll costs, manage our two distribution centers and other inventory and other functions. Such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers, security breaches, and natural disasters. In addition, certain of our management information systems are developed and maintained by external vendors, including our POS system, and some are outdated or of limited functionality. The failure of our management information systems to perform as we anticipate, or to meet the continuously evolving needs of our business, could disrupt our business operations and result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, loss of revenue, and reputational damage.\nWe rely on external vendors for products and services critical to our operations.\nWe rely on external vendors for the manufacture of our owned brand products, other retail products we sell, and products we use during salon services such as color and chemical treatments. We also rely on external vendors for various services critical to our operations and the security of certain Company data. Our dependence on vendors exposes us to operational, reputational, financial, and compliance risk.\nIf our product offerings do not meet our guests\u2019 expectations regarding safety and quality, we could experience lost sales, increased costs, and exposure to legal and reputational risk. All of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products and packages we buy, for either use on a guest during a service or resale to the public, comply with all safety and quality standards. Events that give rise to actual, potential, or perceived product safety concerns or mislabeling could expose us to government enforcement action and/or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities. In addition, we do not own the formulas for certain of our owned brand products, and could be unable to sell those products if the vendor decided to discontinue working with us.\nOur vendors are also responsible for the security of certain Company data, as discussed above. In the event that one of our key vendors becomes unable to continue to provide products and services, or their systems fail, are compromised or the quality of their systems deteriorate, we may suffer operational difficulties and financial loss.\nConsumer shopping trends and changes in manufacturer choice of distribution channels may negatively affect both service and product revenues.\nOur North American Value business is located mainly in strip center locations and Walmart Supercenters and the North American Premium business is primarily in mall-based locations. Our salons are partly dependent on the volume of traffic around these locations in order to generate both service and product revenues. Customer traffic to these shopping areas may be adversely affected by changing consumer shopping trends that favor alternative shopping locations, such as the internet. In particular, we have experienced substantial declines in traffic in some shopping malls due to changes in consumer preferences favoring retail locations other than malls or online shopping.\nIn addition, we are experiencing a proliferation of alternative channels of distribution, like blow dry bars, booth rental facilities, discount brick-and-mortar and online professional products retailers, and manufacturers selling direct to consumers online, which may negatively affect our product and service revenue. Also, product manufacturers may decide to utilize these other distribution channels to a larger extent than in the past and they generally have the right to terminate relationships with us without much advance notice. These trends could reduce the volume of traffic around our salons, and in turn, our revenues may be adversely affected.\nIf we are not able to successfully compete in our business markets, our financial results may be affected.\nCompetition on a market by market basis remains challenging as many smaller chain competitors are franchise systems with local operating strength in certain markets and the hair salon industry as a whole is fragmented and highly competitive for customers, stylists and prime locations. Therefore, our ability to attract guests, raise prices and secure suitable locations in certain markets can be adversely impacted by this competition. Our strategies for competing are complicated by the fact that we have multiple brands in multiple segments, which compete on different factors.\nWe also face significant competition for prime real estate, particularly in strip malls. We compete to lease locations not only with other hair salons, but with a wide variety of businesses looking for similar square footage and high-quality locations.\nFurthermore, our reputation is critical to our ability to compete and succeed. Our reputation may be damaged by negative publicity on social media or other channels regarding the quality of services we provide. There has been a substantial increase in the use of social media platforms, which allow individuals to be heard by a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. Negative or false commentary regarding us or the products or services we offer may be posted on social media platforms at any time. Customers value readily available information and may act on information without further investigation or regard to its accuracy. The harm to our reputation may be immediate, without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. Our reputation may also be damaged by factors that are mostly or entirely out of our control, including actions by a franchisee or a franchisee\u2019s employee. If we are not able to successfully compete, our ability to grow same-store sales and increase our revenue and earnings may be impaired.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are subject to the examination of our income tax returns, payroll taxes and other tax matters by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes and payroll tax accruals. There can be no assurances as to the outcome of these examinations. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and employment taxes. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nOur effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, the outcome of income tax audits, and any repatriation of non-U.S. earnings on which we have not previously provided U.S. taxes.\nChanges to healthcare laws in the U.S. may increase the number of employees who participate in our healthcare plans, which may significantly increase our healthcare costs and negatively impact our operating results.\nWe offer comprehensive healthcare coverage to eligible employees in the United States. Historically, a majority of our eligible employees do not participate in our healthcare plans. Due to changes to healthcare laws in the United States, it is possible that enrollment in the Company\u2019s healthcare plans may increase as individual penalties for failing to have insurance increase pursuant to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and as employees continue to assess their changing healthcare alternatives, including if Medicaid coverage decreases or health insurance exchanges become less favorable. Furthermore, under the ACA, potential fees and or penalties may be assessed against us as a result of individuals either not being offered healthcare coverage within a limited timeframe or if coverage offered does not meet minimum care and affordability standards. An increase in the number of employees who elect to participate in our healthcare plans, changing healthcare-related requirements or if the Company fails to comply with one or more provisions of ACA may significantly increase our healthcare-related costs and negatively impact our operating results.\nChanges to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates may impact our results from operations.\nChanges in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates will have an impact on our expected results from operations. Historically, we have managed the risk related to fluctuations in these rates through the use of fixed rate debt instruments and other financial instruments. In particular, the United Kingdom\u2019s vote in June 2016 to leave the European Union, commonly known as \u201cBrexit,\u201d has increased the volatility of currency exchange rates. If the British pound weakens further, it may adversely affect our results of operations.\nFailure to simplify and standardize our operating processes across our brands could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nStandardization of operating processes across our brands, marketing and products will enable us to simplify our operating model and decrease our costs. Failure to do so could adversely impact our ability to grow revenue and realize further efficiencies within our results of operations.\nIf our joint venture with Empire Education Group is unsuccessful, our financial results may be affected.\nWe have a joint venture arrangement with Empire Education Group (EEG), an operator of accredited cosmetology schools. Due to significantly lower financial projections resulting from continued declines in EEG\u2019s enrollment, revenue and profitability, we recorded a $13.0 million non-cash impairment charge in fiscal year 2016, resulting in a full-impairment of our investment. If EEG is unsuccessful in executing its business plan, or if economic, regulatory and other factors, including declines in enrollment, revenue and profitability continue for the for-profit secondary education market, our financial results may be affected by certain potential liabilities related to this joint venture.\nFailure to control costs may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe must continue to control our expense structure. Failure to manage our cost of product, labor and benefit rates, advertising and marketing expenses, operating lease costs, other store expenses or indirect spending could delay or prevent us from achieving increased profitability or otherwise adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we fail to comply with any of the covenants in our financing arrangements, we may not be able to access our existing revolving credit facility, and we may face an accelerated obligation to repay our indebtedness.\nWe have several financing arrangements that contain financial and other covenants. If we fail to comply with any of the covenants, it may cause a default under one or more of our financing arrangements, which could limit our ability to obtain additional financing under our existing credit facility, require us to pay higher levels of interest or accelerate our obligations to repay our indebtedness.\nChanges in the general economic environment may impact our business and results of operations.\nChanges to the U.S., Canadian and United Kingdom economies have an impact on our business. General economic factors that are beyond our control, such as recession, inflation, deflation, tax rates and policy, energy costs, unemployment trends, extreme weather patterns, other casualty events and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending, may impact our business. In particular, visitation patterns to our salons can be adversely impacted by increases in unemployment rates and decreases in discretionary income levels.\nBrexit may have economic repercussions, including recession, which could adversely impact our operating results.\nChanges in consumer tastes, hair product innovation, fashion trends and consumer spending patterns may impact our revenue.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to anticipate, gauge and react in a timely manner to changes in consumer tastes, hair product innovation, fashion trends and consumer spending patterns. If we do not timely identify and properly respond to evolving trends and changing consumer demands for hair care, our sales may decline significantly. Furthermore, we may accumulate additional inventory and be required to mark down unsold inventory to prices that are significantly lower than normal prices, which could adversely impact our margins and could further adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOperational failure at one of our distribution centers would impact our ability to distribute product.\nWe operate two distribution centers, one near Chattanooga, Tennessee, and one near Salt Lake City, Utah. These supply our North America company-owned salons and many of our franchisees with retail products to sell and products used during salon services. A technology failure or natural disaster that caused one of the distribution centers to be inoperable would cause disruption in our business and could negatively impact our revenues.\nOur enterprise risk management program may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risks.\nWe maintain an enterprise risk management program that is designed to identify, assess, mitigate, and monitor the risks that we face. There can be no assurance that our frameworks or models for assessing and managing known risks, compliance with applicable law, and related controls will effectively mitigate risk and limit losses in all market environments or against all types of risk in our business. If conditions or circumstances arise that expose flaws or gaps in our risk management or compliance programs, the performance and value of our business could be adversely affected.\nInsurance and other traditional risk-shifting tools may be held by or available to Regis in order to manage certain types of risks, but they are subject to terms such as deductibles, retentions, limits and policy exclusions, as well as risk of denial of coverage, default or insolvency. If we suffer unexpected or uncovered losses, or if any of our insurance policies or programs are terminated for any reason or are not effective in mitigating our risks, we may incur losses that are not covered or that exceed our coverage limits and could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nWe rely on our management team and other key personnel.\nWe depend on the skills, working relationships, and continued services of key personnel, including our management team and others throughout our organization. We are also dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, for whom we compete with other companies both inside and outside our industry. Our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted by the unexpected loss of any of our management team or other key personnel, or more generally if we fail to identify, recruit, train and retain talented personnel.", "PERMNO": 76711, "SIC": 7200, "TIC": "RGS"}
