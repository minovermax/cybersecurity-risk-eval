{"cik": "1068875", "company": "BLUCORA, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR STRATEGIC TRANSFORMATION\nAs a result of the HD Vest Acquisition, we may face significant disruptions, business conflicts, inefficiencies, and other related risks.\nOn October 14, 2015, we announced that Blucora had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire HDV Holdings, Inc., the holding company for the group of companies that comprise the Wealth Management business, for $613.7 million (the \u201cHD Vest Acquisition\u201d). For further discussion of the terms of the HD Vest Acquisition, see the \"Strategic Transformation\" section in Part II Item 7 and \"Note 3: Business Combinations\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this annual report. We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the HD Vest Acquisition (including the expected operational, revenue, and cost synergies with our Tax Preparation business and the level of revenue and profitability growth that we are expecting), whether attributable to regulatory limitations, operational realities, or otherwise. We may also face difficulties, including loss of key employees, disruptions in our ongoing operations, and diversion of our and HD Vest\u2019s management\u2019s attention from ongoing operations and opportunities, as we continue to integrate the operations, technologies, products, services, IT systems, controls, and policies and procedures of HD Vest.\nIn addition, notwithstanding the due diligence investigation we performed in connection with the HD Vest Acquisition, HD Vest may have liabilities, losses, or other exposures (including regulatory risks) for which we do not have adequate insurance coverage, indemnification, or other protection.\nThe failure to retain key management and to hire, retain and motivate highly qualified employees, would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe recently announced a leadership transition at HD Vest. The failure to retain key management responsible for the operations of HD Vest beyond this transition could materially and adversely impact those operations, particularly due to the fact that our management team at the corporate level lacks significant experience in the financial services industry. Even if we retain HD Vest\u2019s key management and other employees, we will need to attract and retain additional management resources to continue implementing our change in strategy to a company focused on the technology-enabled financial solutions market.\nOn October 27, 2016, the Company announced that it anticipates relocating its headquarters to the State of Texas during 2017. As part of the relocation, we expect to replace nearly all of our corporate employees, with the exception of our Chief Executive Officer and certain positions that will be eliminated as part of our restructure. We are engaged in a search process to identify, evaluate and select new employees for each position moving to Texas, but there can be no assurance that we will fill every position in a timely manner or at all. In addition, while we have put an enhanced retention program in place to ensure the orderly transition of our key employees, there can be no assurance that the retention program will be successful at retaining our key employees through the move date. The loss of key employees before a suitable replacement is in place may disrupt operations, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESSES\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by market fluctuations and by economic, political, and other factors.\nOur financial condition and results of operations have been, and may in the future be, materially and adversely affected by market conditions and by economic and other factors. Such factors, which can be global, national or local in nature, include: political, social, economic and market conditions; the availability and cost of capital (whether debt or equity); the level and volatility of equity prices, commodity prices and interest rates, currency values and other market indices; technological changes and events; U.S. and foreign government fiscal and tax policies; U.S. and foreign government ability, real or perceived, to avoid defaulting on government securities; inflation; investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets; decline and stress or recession in the U.S. and global economies generally; terrorism and armed conflicts; and natural disasters such as weather catastrophes and widespread health emergencies. Furthermore, changes in consumer economic variables, such as the number and size of personal bankruptcy filings, the rate of unemployment, decreases in property values, and the level of consumer confidence and consumer debt, may substantially affect consumer loan levels and credit quality, which, in turn, could impact client activity in all of our businesses. These factors also may have an impact on our ability to achieve our strategic objectives.\nIn particular, because the significant majority of our Tax Preparation business revenue and all of our Wealth Management business revenue is derived from sales within the U.S., economic conditions in the U.S. have an even greater impact on us than companies with a more diverse international presence. Challenging economic times could cause potential new customers not to purchase or to delay purchasing of our products and services, and could cause our existing customers to discontinue purchasing or delay upgrades of our existing products and services, thereby negatively impacting our revenues and future financial results. Poor economic conditions and high unemployment have caused, and could in the future cause, a significant decrease in the number of tax returns filed, which may have a significant effect on the number of tax returns we prepare and file. In addition, weakness in the end-user consumer and small business markets could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could, in turn, delay paying their obligations to us, which could increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue or future sales to these customers. Any of these events could materially harm our business and our future financial results. In addition, the Trump Administration has called for a broad review of, and potentially significant changes to, to U.S. fiscal and tax laws and regulations, including but not limited to the Dodd-Frank Act. We cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new U.S. federal laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be issued, nor is the impact of such changes on our Tax Preparation or Wealth Management businesses clear. It is possible that some policies adopted by the new administration will benefit us and others will negatively affect us. Until we know what changes are enacted, we will not know whether in total we benefit from, or are negatively affected by, the changes.\nIn addition, our Wealth Management business operates in the U.S. and global capital and credit markets and derives a substantial portion of its revenue from fees based on client assets. Therefore, fluctuations in the U.S. and global equity and debt markets can have a significant impact on HD Vest\u2019s revenues and earnings. As a result, these factors could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe that investment performance is an important factor in the success of our Wealth Management business. Poor investment performance could impair our revenues and earnings, as well as our prospects for growth. Clients do not have long-term obligations to us and can terminate their relationships with us or our financial advisors at will. Our clients can also reduce the aggregate amount of their assets managed by us or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures, for any number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates, changes in investment preferences, changes in our (or our financial advisors\u2019) reputation in the marketplace, changes in client management or ownership, loss of key investment management personnel and financial market performance. A reduction in managed assets, and the associated decrease in revenues and earnings, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and financial results.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain productive advisors, our financial results will be negatively impacted.\nOur Wealth Management business derives a large portion of its revenues from commissions and fees generated by its advisors. Our ability to attract and retain productive advisors has contributed significantly to our growth and success. If we fail to attract new advisors or to retain and motivate our current advisors, replace our advisors who retire, or assist our retiring advisors with transitioning their practices to existing advisors.\nThe market for productive advisors is highly competitive, and we devote significant resources to attracting and retaining the most qualified advisors. In attracting and retaining advisors, we compete directly with a variety of financial institutions such as wirehouses, regional broker-dealers, banks, insurance companies and other independent broker-dealers. If we are not successful in retaining highly qualified advisors, we may not be able to recover the expense involved in attracting and training these individuals. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to attract and retain the advisors needed to achieve our growth objectives.\nFuture revenue growth depends upon our ability to adapt to technological change and successfully introduce new and enhanced products and services.\nThe tax preparation and wealth management industries are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, and frequent new product introductions. Our competitors in such industries offer new and enhanced products and services every year. Consequently, client expectations are constantly changing. We must successfully innovate and develop or offer new products and features to meet evolving client needs and demands, while continually updating our technology infrastructure. We must devote significant resources to continue to develop our skills, tools, and capabilities in order to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies. Our inability to quickly and effectively innovate our products, services, and infrastructure could harm our business and financial results. Our Tax Preparation business also faces potential competition from the public sector, where we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities developing software or other systems to facilitate tax return preparation and electronic filing at no charge to taxpayers. These or similar programs may be introduced or expanded in the future, which may cause us to lose customers and revenue. Although the Free File Alliance has kept the federal government from being a direct competitor to our tax offerings, we anticipate that governmental encroachment at both the federal and state levels may present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future. The current agreement with the Free File Alliance is scheduled to expire in October 2020.\nOur online tax preparation products and services have historically been provided through desktop computers, but the number of people who access similar offerings through mobile devices has increased dramatically in the past few years. We have limited experience to date in mobile platform development, and our existing user experience may not be compelling on mobile devices. Given the speed at which new devices and platforms are being released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our products and services for use on newly developed devices, and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of new user experiences. If we are slow to develop products and services that are compatible with these new devices, particularly if we cannot do so as quickly as our competitors, our market share will decline. In addition, such new products and services may not succeed in the marketplace, resulting in lost market share, wasted development costs, and damage to our brands.\nOur operation systems and network infrastructure is subject to significant and constantly evolving cybersecurity or other technological risks, and the security measures that we have implemented to secure confidential and personal information may be breached; a potential breach may pose risks to the uninterrupted operation of our systems, expose us to mitigation costs, litigation, investigation and penalties by authorities, claims by persons whose information was disclosed, and damage to our reputation.\nWe collect and retain certain sensitive personal data. Our Tax Preparation and Wealth Management businesses collect, use, and retain large amounts of confidential personal and financial information from their customers and clients, including\ninformation regarding income, assets, family members, credit cards, tax returns, bank accounts, social security numbers, and healthcare. Maintaining the integrity of these systems and networks is critical to the success of our business operations, including the retention of our customers, clients and advisors, and to the protection of our proprietary information and our customers' and clients\u2019 personal information. A major breach of our systems or those of our third-party service providers may have materially negative consequences for our businesses, including possible fines, penalties and damages, reduced demand for our services, harm to our reputation and brands, further regulation and oversight by federal or state agencies, and loss of our ability to provide financial transaction services or accept and process customer credit card orders or tax returns. We may detect, or we may receive notices from customers or clients or public or private agencies that they have detected, vulnerabilities in our servers, our software, or third-party software components that are distributed with our products. The existence of vulnerabilities, even if they do not result in a security breach, may harm customer and client confidence and require substantial resources to address, and we may not be able to discover or remediate such security vulnerabilities before they are exploited.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations, and industry rules relating to the collection, use, and security of user data. We expect regulation in this area to increase. As a result of our current data protection policies and practices may not be sufficient and thus may require modification. New regulations may require notification to customers, clients, or employees of a security breach, restrict our use of personal information, and hinder our ability to acquire new, or market to, existing customers and clients. As our business continues to expand to new industry segments that may be more highly regulated for privacy and data security, our compliance requirements and costs may increase. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses to comply with privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards, and contractual obligations.\nIn addition, hackers may develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that can be used to attack our offerings. Although we utilize network and application security measures, internal controls, and physical security procedures to safeguard our systems, there can be no assurance that a security breach, intrusion, or loss or theft of personal information will not occur. Any such incident may materially harm our business, reputation, and future financial results and may require us to expend significant resources to address these problems, including notification under data privacy regulations. In addition, our employees (including temporary and seasonal employees) and contractors may have access to sensitive and personal information of our customers, clients, and employees. While we conduct background checks of our employees and these other individuals and limit access to systems and data, it is possible that one or more of these individuals may circumvent these controls, resulting in a security breach. In addition, we rely on third party vendors to host certain of our sensitive and personal information and data. While we conduct due diligence on these third party partners with respect to their security and business controls, we may not have the ability to effectively monitor or oversee the implementation of these control measures, and, in any event, individuals or third parties may be able to circumvent and/or exploit vulnerabilities that may exist in these security and business controls, resulting in a loss of sensitive and personal customer, client, or employee information and data.\nDespite the measures we have taken and may in the future take to address and mitigate cybersecurity and technology risks, we cannot assure that our systems and networks will not be subject to breaches or interference. Any such event may result in operational disruptions as well as unauthorized access to or the disclosure or loss of our proprietary information or our customers\u2019 and clients\u2019 personal information, which in turn may result in legal claims, regulatory scrutiny and liability, reputational damage, the incurrence of costs to eliminate or mitigate further exposure, the loss of customers, clients, or advisors, or other damage to our business. While we maintain cyber liability insurance that provides both third-party liability and first-party liability coverages, this insurance is subject to exclusions and may not be sufficient to protect us against all losses. In addition, the trend toward broad consumer and general public notification of such incidents could exacerbate the harm to our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Even if we successfully protect our technology infrastructure and the confidentiality of sensitive data, we may incur significant expenses in connection with our responses to any such attacks as well as the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of appropriate security measures. We could also suffer harm to our business and reputation if attempted security breaches are publicized. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, discovery of new vulnerabilities, attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in our systems, data thefts, physical system or network break-ins, inappropriate access, or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology or other security measures protecting the networks and systems used in connection with our businesses.\nIncreased government regulation of our business may harm our operating results.\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations that affect our activities, including, without limitation, areas of labor, advertising, tax, financial services, data privacy and security requirements, digital content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, promotions, quality of services, intellectual property ownership and infringement, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, anti-competition, environmental, health, and safety. There have been significant new regulations and heightened focus by the government on many of these areas, as well as in areas such as insurance and healthcare (including, for example, the Affordable Care Act). As we complete our Strategic Transformation and\nexpand our products and services and revise our business models, we may become subject to additional government regulation or increased regulatory scrutiny. Regulators may adopt new laws or regulations or their interpretation of existing laws or regulations may differ from ours as well as the laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate. The Trump Administration has called for a board review of, and potentially significant changes to, U.S. fiscal and tax laws and regulations. These changes may include comprehensive tax reform as well as the rolling back or repeal of various financial regulations, including the DOL fiduciary rule and the Dodd-Frank Act. We cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new U.S. federal laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be issued, nor is the impact of such changes on our Tax Preparation or Wealth Management businesses clear. It is possible that some policies adopted by the new administration will benefit us and others will negatively affect us. Until we know what changes are enacted, we will not know whether in total we benefit from, or are negatively affected by, the changes.\nThese regulatory requirements could impose significant limitations, require changes to our business, require notification to customers, clients, or employees of a security breach, restrict our use of personal information, or cause changes in customer purchasing behavior that may make our business more costly, less efficient, or impossible to conduct, and may require us to modify our current or future products or services, which may materially harm our future financial results.\nThe tax preparation industry continues to receive heightened attention from federal and state governments. New legislation, regulation, public policy considerations, changes in the cybersecurity environment, litigation by the government or private entities, or new interpretations of existing laws may result in greater oversight of the tax preparation industry, restrict the types of products and services that we can offer or the prices we can charge, or otherwise cause us to change the way we operate our Tax Preparation business or offer our tax preparation products and services. We may not be able to respond quickly to such regulatory, legislative and other developments, and these changes may in turn increase our cost of doing business and limit our revenue opportunities. In addition, if our practices are not consistent with new interpretations of existing laws, we may become subject to lawsuits, penalties, and other liabilities that did not previously apply. We are also required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services. Changes in state-imposed requirements by one or more of the states, including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards, may significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and may prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner and at an acceptable price.\nOur Wealth Management business is subject to certain additional financial industry regulations and supervision, including by the SEC, FINRA, DOL, state securities and insurance regulators, and other regulatory authorities. Our failure to comply with the laws, rules, and regulations promulgated by federal regulatory bodies and the regulatory authorities in each of the states and other jurisdictions in which we do business could result in the restriction of the ongoing conduct or growth, or even liquidation of, parts of our business and otherwise materially impact our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. These regulatory authorities continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws, regulations, or interpretations, and there can also be no assurance that other federal or state agencies will not attempt to further regulate our business. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted into law in 2010, called for sweeping changes in the supervision and regulations of the wealth management industry. Regulators implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have adopted, proposed to adopt, and will in the future adopt regulations that may impact the manner in which we will market HD Vest products and services, manage HD Vest operations, and interact with regulators. As noted above, the Trump Administration has called for a broad review of, and potentially significant changes to, U.S. fiscal laws and regulations which may include the rolling back or even repeal of certain financial regulations, including but not limited to the Dodd-Frank Act. Until we know what changes are enacted, we will not know whether such changes will have a positive or negative impact on our business.\nIn April 2016, the DOL issued final regulations changing the definition of who is a fiduciary under ERISA and specifying how such fiduciaries must provide investment advice to Covered Accounts. Over the past several quarters, IRAs made up approximately half of HD Vest's assets under administration. The new DOL regulations focus on conflicts of interest related to investment recommendations made by financial advisors to clients holding Covered Accounts. The rules bring virtually all of the investment products and services HD Vest currently provides to IRA owners within the scope of ERISA. The rules, the applicability of which are phased in between April 10, 2017 and January 1, 2018, will require HD Vest to either: (1) subject such Covered Accounts to a level fee arrangement under which (a) the firm and affiliates receive a fee based on a fixed percentage of the value of assets in the account and (b) no ERISA prohibited transactions are otherwise implicated; or (2) comply with one of the DOL prohibited transaction exemptions that impose significant new and additional compliance and disclosure requirements, and restrict the manner in which HD Vest can earn revenue and pay its financial advisors. On February 3, 2017, President Trump issued a memorandum directing the Secretary of Labor to examine the DOL fiduciary rule, make certain determinations regarding the rule\u2019s impact, and based on the outcome of that review potentially publish a proposed rule rescinding or revising the rule. Accordingly, it is uncertain whether the rule will become applicable, when it will be applicable, and what form any final regulation might take after the required review is completed. If the regulations are applied in their current form, they will impact how HD Vest designs investment products and services for Covered Accounts,\nhow we receive fees, and how we compensate our advisors. The regulations will impact how we are able to recruit and retain financial advisors and will require us to change systems and implement new compliance programs and client disclosures. In addition, if HD Vest relies on the new Best Interest Contract prohibited transaction exemption, the firm will be required to adopt new \u201cimpartial conduct\u201d policies and procedures and make contractual representations and warranties to clients that HD Vest will comply with such policies and procedures and abide by fiduciary standards. These requirements, coupled with ambiguity inherent in the new rules, will likely lead to increased regulatory scrutiny and litigation related to the provision of investment advice to IRA and ERISA investors. HD Vest\u2019s management team has devoted and, if the regulations are applied in their current form, expects to continue to devote substantial time and resources to assess the new rules, implement required policies and procedures, and develop and execute a business strategy in light of such rules, diminishing the firm\u2019s ability to focus on other initiatives. Depending on the scope of required changes, if HD Vest is not able to complete necessary modifications to its business practices and operational systems by the applicability date, its ability to process business for Covered Accounts will be negatively impacted. As a result, the new DOL rules and related litigation and regulatory scrutiny could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, investigations, claims, or other actions or proceedings by regulators or third-parties with respect to our compliance with these new regulations may also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, and interpretations is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance, audit, and reporting systems and procedures, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance, audit, and risk management personnel. While we have adopted systems, policies, and procedures reasonably designed to comply or facilitate compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, and interpretations, these systems, policies, and procedures may not be fully effective. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to investigations, claims, or other actions or proceedings by regulators or third-parties with respect to our past or future compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations, the outcome of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nHD Vest distributes its products and services through financial advisors who affiliate with the firm as independent contractors. There can be no assurance that legislative, judicial, or regulatory (including tax) authorities will not introduce proposals or assert interpretations of existing rules and regulations that would change, or at least challenge, the classification of our financial advisors as independent contractors. Although we believe we have properly classified our advisors as independent contractors, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other U.S. federal or state authorities or similar authorities may determine that we have misclassified our advisors as independent contractors for employment tax or other purposes and, as a result, seek additional taxes from us or attempt to impose fines and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business model, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to develop, manage, and maintain critical third party business relationships for our Tax Preparation and Wealth Management businesses, those businesses may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur Tax Preparation and Wealth Management businesses are dependent on the strength of our business relationships and our ability to continue to develop, maintain, and leverage new and existing relationships. We rely on various third party partners, including software and service providers, suppliers, vendors, distributors, contractors, financial institutions, and licensing partners, among others, in many areas of these businesses to deliver our services and products. In certain instances, the products or services provided through these third party relationships may be difficult to replace or substitute, depending on the level of integration of the third party\u2019s products or services into, or with, our offerings and/or the general availability of such third party\u2019s products and services. In addition, there may be few or no alternative third party providers or vendors in the market. The failure of third parties to provide acceptable and high quality products, services, and technologies or to update their products, services, and technologies may result in a disruption to our business operations, which may materially reduce our revenues and profits, cause us to lose customers and clients, and damage our reputation. Alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner.\nOur Wealth Management business distributes certain investment and insurance products through distribution agreements with third-party financial institutions, including banks, mutual funds, and insurance companies. These products are sold by our financial advisors, who are independent contractors. Maintaining and deepening relationships with these unaffiliated distributors and financial advisors is an important part of our growth strategy because strong third-party distribution arrangements enhance our ability to market our products and increase our assets under management, revenues, and profitability. There can be no assurance that the distribution and financial advisor relationships we have established will continue. Our distribution partners and financial advisors may cease to operate, consolidate, institute cost-cutting efforts, or otherwise terminate their relationship with us. Any such reduction in access to third-party distributors and financial advisors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products and to generate revenue in our Wealth Management segment.\nAccess to investment and insurance product distribution channels is subject to intense competition due to the large number of competitors and products in the broker-dealer, investment advisory and insurance industries. Relationships with distributors are subject to periodic negotiation that may result in increased distribution costs and/or reductions in the amount of revenue we realize based on sales of particular products or client assets. In addition, regulatory changes may negatively impact our revenues and profits related to particular products or services. Any increase in the costs to distribute our products or reduction in the type or amount of products made available for sale, or revenue associated with those products, may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nThe Tax Preparation and Wealth Management markets are very competitive, and failure to effectively compete will materially and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur Tax Preparation business operates in a very competitive marketplace. There are many competing software products and online services. Intuit\u2019s TurboTax and H&R Block\u2019s products and services have a significant percentage of the software and online service market. Our Tax Preparation business must also compete with alternate methods of tax preparation, including \"pencil and paper\" do-it-yourself return preparation by individual filers and storefront tax preparation services, including both local tax preparers and large chains such as H&R Block, Liberty, and Jackson Hewitt. Finally, our Tax Preparation business faces the risk that state or federal taxing agencies will offer software or systems to provide direct access for individual filers that will reduce the need for TaxAct\u2019s software and services. As digital do-it-yourself tax preparation continues to be characterized by intense competition, including heavy marketing expenditures, price-based competition, and new entrants, maintaining and growing share becomes more challenging unless brand relevance, customer experience, and feature/functionality provide meaningful incremental value. Our financial results may materially suffer if we cannot continue to offer software and services that have quality and ease-of-use that are compelling to consumers; market the software and services in a cost-effective manner; offer ancillary services that are attractive to users; and develop the software and services at a low enough cost to be able to offer them at a competitive price point.\nThe wealth management industry in which HD Vest operates is highly competitive, and we may not be able to maintain our clients, financial advisors, distribution network, or the terms on which we provide our products and services. HD Vest competes based on a number of factors, including name recognition, service, the quality of investment advice, investment performance, technology, product offerings and features, price, and perceived financial strength. Competitors in the wealth management industry include broker-dealers, banks, asset managers, insurers, and other financial institutions. Many of these competitors have greater market share, offer a broader range of products and have greater financial resources. In addition, over time certain sectors of the wealth management industry have become considerably more concentrated, as financial institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. This consolidation could result in our competitors gaining greater resources, and we may experience pressures on our pricing and market share as a result of these factors and as some of our competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices.\nOur website and transaction management software, data center systems, or the systems of third-party co-location facilities and cloud service providers could fail or become unavailable or otherwise be inadequate, which could materially harm our reputation and result in a material loss of revenues and current or potential customers and clients.\nAny system interruptions that result in the unavailability or unreliability of our websites, transaction processing systems, or network infrastructure could materially reduce our revenue and impair our ability to properly process transactions. We use both internally developed and third-party systems, including cloud computing and storage systems, for our online services and certain aspects of transaction processing. Some of our systems are relatively new and untested and thus may be subject to failure or unreliability. Any system unavailability or unreliability may cause unanticipated system disruptions, slower response times, degradation in customer satisfaction, additional expense, or delays in reporting accurate financial information.\nOur data centers and cloud service could be susceptible to damage or disruption, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and financial results. Our Tax Preparation and Wealth Management businesses have disaster recovery centers but if their primary data centers fail and those disaster recovery centers do not fully restore the failed environments, our business will suffer. In particular, if such interruption occurs during the tax season, the revenue of our Tax Preparation business would be materially and adversely impacted.\nOur systems and operations, and those of our third-party service providers, could be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, earthquakes, other natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failure, internet breakdown, break-in, human error, software bugs, hardware failures, malicious attacks, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks, terrorist attacks, or other events beyond our control. Such damage or interruption may affect internal and external systems that we rely upon to provide our services, take and fulfill customer orders, handle customer service requests, and host other products and services.\nDuring the period in which services are unavailable, we will be unable or severely limited in our ability to generate revenues, and we may also be exposed to liability from those third parties to whom we provide services. We could face significant losses as a result of these events, and our business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all potential losses.\nA drop in our investment performance could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nInvestment performance is a key competitive factor for our Wealth Management segment. Strong investment performance helps to increase client retention and generate sales of products and services. There can be no assurance as to how future investment performance will compare to our competitors, and historical performance is not indicative of future returns. Any drop or perceived drop in investment performance, on an absolute or relative basis, could cause a decline in sales of mutual funds and other investment products, an increase in redemptions and the termination of asset management relationships. These impacts may reduce our aggregate amount of assets under management and reduce management fees. Poor investment performance could also adversely affect our ability to expand the distribution of our products through independent financial advisors.\nRestrictions on, changes to, or litigation regarding financial products may materially harm our financial results.\nIn our Tax Preparation business, we generate revenue from certain financial products related to our tax preparation software and services. These products include prepaid debit cards on which a tax filer may receive his or her tax refund and the ability of certain of our users to have the fees for our services deducted from their tax refund. Any regulation of these products by state or federal governments, or any competing products offered by state and federal tax collection agencies, could materially and adversely impact our revenue from these financial products. In addition, litigation brought by consumers or state or federal agencies relating to these products may result in additional restrictions on the offering of these products. To the extent that any such additional restrictions or legal claims restrict our ability to offer such products, our financial results may materially suffer.\nOur Wealth Management business offers products sponsored by third parties, including but not limited mutual funds, insurance, annuities and alternative investments. These products are subject to complex regulations that change frequently. Although HD Vest has controls in place to facilitate compliance with such regulations, there can be no assurance that its interpretation of the regulations will be consistent with various regulators\u2019 interpretations, that its procedures will be viewed as adequate by regulatory examiners, or that the operating subsidiaries will be deemed to be in compliance with regulatory requirements in all material respects. If products sold by the firm were not to perform as anticipated due to market factors or otherwise, or if the product sponsor became insolvent or is otherwise unable to meet its obligations, this would likely result in material litigation and regulatory action against HD Vest relating to its sales of those products.\nIn response to the DOL rules, product manufacturers have started to revise the pricing and compensation structures associated with mutual funds, annuities, and alternative products offered by HD Vest. With respect to mutual funds, the broad implementation of additional fund share classes, or broad adoption of so-called \u201cclean\u201d shares which would be sold at net asset value without any 12b-1 payments or servicing fees, could result in additional competitive pressures, fee compression, and materially reduced compensation for HD Vest in connection with offering these products to investment clients. These product changes may be implemented by fund companies and other product manufacturers regardless of whether the DOL fiduciary rule is revised or rescinded.\nRegistered investment advisors have fiduciary obligations that require us and our advisors to act in the best interests of our clients and to disclose any material conflicts of interest. We may face liabilities for actual or alleged breaches of legal duties to clients with respect to the suitability of the financial products we make available in our open architecture product platform or the investment advice of our financial advisors.\nUnanticipated changes in income tax rates, deduction types, or taxation structure may materially and adversely affect our Tax Preparation business.\nChanges in the way that state and federal governments structure their taxation regimes may materially and adversely affect our financial results. The introduction of a simplified or flattened taxation structure may make our services less necessary or attractive to individual filers. We also face risk from the possibility of increased complexity in taxation structures, which may encourage some of our customers to seek professional tax advice instead of using our software or services. In the event that such changes to tax structures cause us to lose market share, our results may materially suffer.\nIf our Tax Preparation business fails to process transactions effectively or fails to adequately protect against disputed or potential fraudulent activities, our revenue and earnings may be materially harmed.\nOur Tax Preparation business processes a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis, particularly during tax season. Due to the size and volume of transactions that we handle, effective processing systems and controls are essential to ensure that transactions are handled appropriately. Despite our efforts, it is possible that we may make errors or that fraudulent activity may affect our services. In addition to any direct damages and fines that may result from any such problems, which may be substantial, a loss of confidence in our controls may materially harm our business and damage our brand. The systems supporting our Tax Preparation business are comprised of multiple technology platforms, some of which are difficult to scale. If we are unable to effectively manage our systems and processes, we may be unable to process customer data in an accurate, reliable, and timely manner, which may materially harm our business.\nThe seasonality of our Tax Preparation business requires a precise development and release schedule and any delays or issues with accuracy or quality may damage our reputation and materially harm our future financial results.\nOur tax preparation software and online service must be ready to launch in final form near the beginning of each calendar year to take advantage of the full tax season. We must update the code for our software and service on a precise schedule each year to account for annual changes in tax laws and regulations and ensure that the software and service are accurate. Delayed and unpredictable changes to federal and state tax laws and regulations can cause an already tight development cycle to become even more challenging. If we are unable to meet this precise schedule and we launch our software and service late, we risk losing customers to our competitors. If we cannot develop our software with a high degree of accuracy and quality, we risk errors in the tax returns that are generated. Such errors could result in loss of reputation, lower customer retention, or legal claims, fees, and payouts related to the warranty on our software and service.\nRisk management policies and procedures for our Tax Preparation and Wealth Management business may not be fully effective in identifying or mitigating risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, including employee and financial advisor misconduct.\nWe are subject to the risks of errors and misconduct by our employees and financial advisors, such as fraud, non-compliance with policies, recommending transactions that are not suitable, and improperly using or disclosing confidential information. Although we have internal controls in place, these issues are difficult to detect in advance and deter, and could materially harm our business, results of operations or financial condition. We are further subject to the risk of nonperformance or inadequate performance of contractual obligations by third-party vendors of products and services that are used in our businesses. Management of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk. Insurance and other traditional risk-shifting tools may be held by or available to us in order to manage certain exposures, but they are subject to terms such as deductibles, coinsurance, limits and policy exclusions, as well as the risk of counterparty denial of coverage, default or insolvency.\nIf we are unable to hire, retain, and motivate highly qualified employees, including our key employees, we may not be able to successfully manage our businesses.\nOur future success depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, retain, and motivate highly skilled management, technical, sales and marketing, and corporate development personnel, including personnel with experience and expertise in the wealth management, tax preparation, and technology industries to support our new strategic focus. Qualified personnel with experience relevant to our businesses are scarce, and competition to recruit them is intense. If we fail to successfully hire and retain a sufficient number of highly qualified employees, we may have difficulties in supporting or expanding our businesses. Realignments of resources, reductions in workforce, or other operational decisions have created and could continue to create an unstable work environment and may have a negative effect on our ability to hire, retain, and motivate employees.\nOur business and operations are substantially dependent on the performance of our key employees. Changes of management or key employees may disrupt operations, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial results or delay achievement of our business objectives. In addition, if we lose the services of one or more key employees and are unable to recruit and retain a suitable successor, we may not be able to successfully and timely manage our business or achieve our business objectives. There can be no assurance that any retention program we initiate will be successful at retaining employees, including key employees. As part of the relocation of our corporate headquarters to Irving, Texas, we expect to replace nearly all of our corporate employees, with the exception of our Chief Executive Officer and certain positions that will\nbe eliminated as part of our restructure. We will engage in a search process to identify, evaluate and select new employees for each position moving to Texas, but there can be no assurance that we will fill every position in a timely manner or at all. In addition, while we have put an enhanced retention program in place to ensure the orderly transition of our key employees, there can be no assurance that the retention program will be successful at retaining our key employees through the move date. The loss of key employees before a suitable replacement is in place may disrupt operations, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, we recently announced leadership transitions at our Tax Preparation and Wealth Management segments. The uncertainty inherent in leadership transitions can be difficult to manage, may cause concerns from third parties with whom we do business, and may increase the likelihood of turnover of other key officers, employees and, in the case of our Wealth Management segment, turnover of advisors. If we are not effective in managing these leadership transitions, our business could be adversely impacted and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe use stock options, restricted stock units, and other equity-based awards to recruit and retain senior level employees. With respect to those employees to whom we issue such equity-based awards, we face a significant challenge in retaining them if the value of equity-based awards in aggregate or individually is either not deemed by the employee to be substantial enough or deemed so substantial that the employee leaves after their equity-based awards vest. If our stock price does not increase significantly above the exercise prices of our options, we may need to issue new equity-based awards in order to motivate and retain our key employees. We may undertake or seek stockholder approval to undertake other equity-based programs to retain our employees, which may be viewed as dilutive to our stockholders or may increase our compensation costs. There can be no assurance that any such programs, if approved by stockholders, or any other incentive programs, would be successful in motivating and retaining our employees.\nRestructuring and streamlining our business, and relocating our headquarters, including implementing reductions in workforce, discretionary spending, and other expense reductions, may materially harm our businesses.\nWe have in the past found and may in the future find it advisable to take measures to streamline operations and reduce expenses, including, without limitation, reducing our workforce or discontinuing products or businesses. For example, in connection with our Strategic Transformation (as described in the \"Strategic Transformation\" section in Part II Item 7 of this annual report), we have effected and will in the future effect significant reductions-in-force. In addition, on October 27, 2016, we announced that we will be relocating our headquarters to the State of Texas during 2017. As part of the relocation, we expect to replace nearly all of our corporate employees, with the exception of our Chief Executive Officer and certain positions that will be eliminated as part of our restructure. Such measures may place significant strains on our management and employees. We have incurred and may continue to incur liabilities from these measures, including liabilities from retention bonuses, enhanced severance payments, early termination or assignment of contracts, potential failure to meet obligations due to loss of employees or resources, and resulting litigation. Such effects from restructuring, streamlining and relocating could have a materially negative impact on our business, financial condition, and financial results.\nOur business depends on our strong reputation and the value of our brands, which could be negatively impacted by poor performance.\nDeveloping and maintaining awareness of our brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future products and services and is an important element in attracting new customers and clients. Adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to regulatory proceedings or other events or activities attributed to our businesses, our employees, our vendors, or our partners may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands. In addition, if we are unable to successfully integrate HD Vest or if we are unable to develop awareness of the HD Vest brand, our reputation could be damaged. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our future financial results. Such damage also would require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of the brands.\nIf others claim that our services infringe their intellectual property rights, we may be forced to seek expensive licenses, reengineer our services, engage in expensive and time-consuming litigation, or stop marketing and licensing our services.\nCompanies and individuals with rights relating to the technology industry have frequently resorted to litigation regarding intellectual property rights. These parties have in the past made and may in the future make claims against us alleging infringement of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, or alleging unfair competition or violations of privacy or publicity rights. Responding to any such claims could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management\u2019s attention, cause product or service release delays, or require removal or redesigning of our products or services, payment of damages for infringement, or entry into royalty or licensing agreements. Our technology,\nservices, and products may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. In some cases, the ownership or scope of an entity\u2019s or person\u2019s rights is unclear. In addition, the ownership or scope of such rights may be altered by changes in the legal landscape, such as through developments in U.S. or international intellectual property laws or regulations or through court, agency, or regulatory board decisions. If a successful claim of infringement were made against us and we could not develop non-infringing technology or content, or license the infringed or similar technology or content, on a timely and cost-effective basis, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe do not regularly conduct patent searches to determine whether the technology used in our products or services infringes patents held by third parties. Patent searches may not return every issued patent or patent application that may be deemed relevant to a particular product or service. It is therefore difficult to determine, with any level of certainty, whether a particular product or service may be construed as infringing a current or future U.S. or foreign patent.\nWe rely heavily on our technology and intellectual property, but we may be unable to adequately or cost-effectively protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, thereby weakening our competitive position and negatively impacting our business and financial results. We may have to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights, which can be time consuming, expensive, and difficult to predict.\nTo protect our rights in our services and technology, we rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, and protective contractual provisions. We also rely on laws pertaining to trademarks and domain names to protect the value of our corporate brands and reputation. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our services or technology, obtain and use information, marks, or technology that we regard as proprietary, or otherwise violate or infringe our intellectual property rights. In addition, it is possible that others could independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property. If we do not effectively protect our intellectual property, or if others independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property, our competitive position could be materially weakened.\nEffectively policing the unauthorized use of our services and technology is time-consuming and costly, and the steps taken by us may not prevent misappropriation of our technology or other proprietary assets. The efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective, and unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our services, use similar marks or domain names, or obtain and use information, marks, or technology that we regard as proprietary. In some cases, the ownership or scope of an entity\u2019s or person\u2019s rights is unclear and may also change over time, including through changes in U.S. or international intellectual property laws or regulations or through court, agency, or regulatory board decisions.\nWe may have to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of others\u2019 proprietary rights, which are sometimes not clear or may change. Litigation can be time-consuming and expensive, and the outcome can be difficult to predict.\nWe may seek to acquire companies or assets that complement our Wealth Management and Tax Preparation businesses, and our financial and operating results may materially suffer if we are unsuccessful in completing any such acquisitions on favorable terms.\nWe may seek to acquire companies or assets that complement our Wealth Management and Tax Preparation businesses. There can be no guarantee that any of the opportunities that we evaluate will result in the purchase by us of any business or asset being evaluated, or that, if acquired, we will be able to successfully integrate such acquisition.\nIf we are successful in our pursuit of any complementary acquisition opportunities, we intend to use available cash, debt and/or equity financing, and/or other capital or ownership structures designed to diversify our capital sources and attract a competitive cost of capital, all of which may change our leverage profile. There are a number of factors that impact our ability to succeed in acquiring the companies and assets we identify, including competition for these companies and assets, sometimes from larger or better-funded competitors. As a result, our success in completing acquisitions is not guaranteed. Our expectation is that, to the extent we are successful, any acquisitions will be additive to our businesses, taking into account potential benefits of operational synergies. However, these new business additions and acquisitions, if any, involve a number of risks and may not achieve our expectations, and, therefore, we could be materially and adversely affected by any such new business additions or acquisitions. There can be no assurance that the short or long-term value of any business or technology that we develop or acquire will be equal to the value of the cash and other consideration that we pay or expenses we incur.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS\nWe incurred debt in connection with our acquisition of HD Vest and may incur future debt related to other complementary acquisitions, which may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results.\nIn connection with our acquisition of HD Vest, TaxAct and HD Vest incurred debt under a December 2015 credit facility, of which $260.0 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2016. The TaxAct-HD Vest credit facility is a non-recourse debt and guaranteed by TaxAct Holdings, Inc. and HD Vest Holdings, Inc., all of which are Blucora\u2019s direct subsidiaries. These debts may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by, among other things:\n\u2022\nincreasing TaxAct\u2019s or HD Vest's vulnerability to downturns in their businesses, to competitive pressures, and to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash from TaxAct\u2019s and HD Vest's operations to service the indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and complementary acquisitions;\n\u2022\nrequiring cash infusions from Blucora to TaxAct or HD Vest if any or all are unable to meet their payment or other obligations under the applicable credit facilities;\n\u2022\nincreasing our interest payment obligations in the event that interest rates rise dramatically; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and our industries.\nThese credit facilities impose restrictions on TaxAct and HD Vest, including restrictions on their ability to create liens on their assets and on our ability to incur indebtedness, and require TaxAct and HD Vest to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Their ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond their control. In addition, these credit facilities include covenants, the breach of which may cause the outstanding indebtedness to be declared immediately due and payable. These debts, and our ability to repay them, may also negatively impact our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may affect the terms of any such financing.\nIn addition, we or our subsidiaries may incur additional debt in the future to finance complementary acquisitions or for other purposes. Any additional debt may result in risks similar to those discussed above related to the TaxAct-HD Vest debt or in other risks specific to the credit agreements entered into for those debts.\nWe sold $201.25 million of Convertible Senior Notes in 2013, which may impact our financial results, result in the dilution of existing stockholders, and restrict our ability to take advantage of future opportunities.\nIn March 2013, we sold $201.25 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes (the \u201cNotes\u201d) due 2019. As of December 31, 2016, $172.9 million was outstanding. The accounting for the Notes results in the recognition of interest expense significantly more than the stated interest rate of the Notes and may result in volatility to our financial results. The Notes may be settled in a combination of cash or shares of common stock, indicating that the Notes contain liability and equity components. Upon issuance of the Notes, we were required to establish a separate initial value for the conversion option, the equity component, and bifurcate this value from the value attributable to the debt component of the Notes. As a result, for accounting purposes, we were required to treat the Notes as having been issued with a debt discount to their principal amount. We are accreting the debt discount to interest expense ratably over the term of the Notes, which amounts to an effective interest rate in our financial results that exceeds the stated interest rate of the Notes. This will reduce our earnings and could adversely affect the price at which our common stock trades but will have no effect on the amount of cash interest paid to holders or on our cash flows.\nOur intent is to settle conversions of the Notes with cash for the principal amount of the debt and shares of common stock for any related conversion premium. Shares associated with the conversion premium will be included in diluted earnings per share when the average stock price exceeds the conversion price of the Notes and could adversely affect our diluted earnings per share and the price at which our common stock trades.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, and the requirement to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change, may adversely affect our financial condition and financial results. In the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of the Notes will be entitled, at their option, to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods. If we undergo a fundamental change (as described in the applicable Indenture), subject to certain conditions,\nholders of the Notes may require us to repurchase all or part of their Notes for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nThe payment of the interest and the repayment of principal at maturity, conversion, or under a fundamental change will require the use of a substantial amount of our cash. If such cash is not available, we may be required to sell other assets or enter into alternate financing arrangements at terms that may or may not be desirable. The existence of the Notes and the obligations we incurred by issuing them may hinder our ability to take advantage of certain future opportunities, such as engaging in future debt or equity financing activities, which may in turn reduce or impair our ability to acquire new businesses or invest in our existing businesses.\nExisting cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash generated from operations may not be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for servicing debt, working capital, and capital expenditures.\nAlthough we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for servicing debt, working capital, and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months, the underlying levels of revenues and expenses that we project may not prove to be accurate. As of December 31, 2016, we had $172.9 million outstanding under the Notes, and HD Vest and TaxAct had $260.0 million outstanding under the credit facility entered into in December 2015. Servicing these debts will require the dedication of a portion of our expected cash flow from operations, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes. In addition, our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our businesses may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition and results at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nIn addition, we may evaluate complementary acquisitions of businesses, products, or technologies from time to time. Any such transactions, if completed, may use a significant portion of our cash balances and marketable investments. If we are unable to liquidate our investments when we need liquidity for complementary acquisitions or for other business purposes, we may need to change or postpone such acquisitions or find alternative financing for them. We may seek additional funding through public or private financings, through sales of equity, or through other arrangements. Our ability to raise funds may be materially and adversely affected by a number of factors, including factors beyond our control, such as economic conditions in the markets in which we operate and increased uncertainty in the financial, capital, and credit markets. Adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to existing stockholders may result. If funding is insufficient at any time in the future, we may be unable, or delayed in our ability, to develop or enhance our products or services, take advantage of business opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could materially harm our business.\nOTHER RISKS\nOur stock price has been highly volatile and such volatility may continue.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile, and such volatility does not always correspond to fluctuations in the market. Between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2016, our closing stock price ranged from $4.76 to $16.60. On February 21, 2017, the closing price of our common stock was $15.80. Our stock price could decline or fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, including the other risks discussed in this report and the following:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly and annual results of operations;\n\u2022\nimpairment charges, changes in or loss of material contracts and relationships, dispositions or announcements of complementary acquisitions, or other business developments by us, our partners, or our competitors;\n\u2022\nconditions or trends in the tax preparation or wealth management markets:\n\u2022\nchanges in general conditions in the U.S. and global economies or financial markets;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations or new services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\ndisclosures of any accounting issues, such as restatements or material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nequity issuances resulting in the dilution of stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe adoption of new regulations or accounting standards;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity (whether justified or not) with respect to our business; and\n\u2022\nannouncements or publicity relating to litigation or governmental enforcement actions.\nIn addition, the equities market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, and our stock has been particularly susceptible to such fluctuations. Often, class action litigation has been instituted against companies after periods of volatility in the price of such companies\u2019 stock. We have been defendants in such class action litigation in prior periods and could be subject to future litigation, potentially resulting in substantial cost and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur financial results may fluctuate, which could cause our stock price to be volatile or decline.\nOur financial results have varied on a quarterly basis and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations could cause our stock price to be volatile or decline. Many factors could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate materially, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe inability of any of our businesses to meet our expectations;\n\u2022\nthe seasonality of our Tax Preparation business and the resulting large quarterly fluctuations in our revenues;\n\u2022\nthe success or failure of our Strategic Transformation and our ability to implement those initiatives in a cost effective manner;\n\u2022\nthe mix of revenues generated by existing businesses, discontinued operations or other businesses that we develop or acquire;\n\u2022\ngains or losses driven by fair value accounting;\n\u2022\nlitigation expenses and settlement costs;\n\u2022\nmisconduct by employees and/or HD Vest financial advisors, which is difficult to detect and deter;\n\u2022\nexpenses incurred in finding, evaluating, negotiating, consummating, and integrating acquisitions;\n\u2022\nimpairment or negative performance of the many different industries and counterparties we rely on and are exposed to;\n\u2022\nvariable demand for our services, rapidly evolving technologies and markets, and consumer preferences;\n\u2022\nany restructuring charges we may incur;\n\u2022\nany economic downturn, which could result in lower acceptance rates on premium products and services offered by our Wealth Management business and impact the commissions and fee revenues of our financial advisory services;\n\u2022\nthe level and mix of assets we have under management and administration, which are subject to fluctuation based on market conditions and client activity;\n\u2022\nnew court rulings, or the adoption of new laws, rules, or regulations, that adversely affect our tax preparation products and services, or our wealth management offerings or that otherwise increase our potential liability or compliance costs;\n\u2022\nimpairment in the value of long-lived assets or the value of acquired assets, including goodwill, technology, and acquired contracts and relationships; and\n\u2022\nthe effect of changes in accounting principles or standards or in our accounting treatment of revenues or expenses.\nFor these reasons, among others, you should not rely on period-to-period comparisons of our financial results to forecast our future performance. Furthermore, our fluctuating operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors and financial results volatility could make us less attractive to investors, either of which could cause the trading price of our stock to decline.\nIf there is a change in our ownership within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) may be severely limited or potentially eliminated.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had federal NOLs of $504.0 million that will expire primarily between 2020 and 2024. If we were to have a change of ownership within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (defined as a cumulative change of 50 percentage points or more in the ownership positions of certain stockholders owning five percent or more of a company\u2019s common stock over a three-year rolling period), then under certain conditions, the amount of NOLs we could use in any one year could be limited. Our certificate of incorporation imposes certain limited transfer restrictions on our common stock that we expect will assist us in preventing a change of ownership and preserving our NOLs, but there can be no assurance that these restrictions will be sufficient. In addition, other restrictions on our ability to use the NOLs may be triggered by a merger or acquisition, depending on the structure of such a transaction. It is our intention to limit the potential impact of these restrictions, but there can be no guarantee that such efforts will be successful. If we are unable to use our NOLs before they expire, or if the use of this tax benefit is severely limited or eliminated, there could be a material reduction in the amount of after-tax income and cash flow from operations, and it could have an effect on our ability to engage in certain transactions.\nDelaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover, which could cause the market price of our shares to decline.\nWe are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. For example, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage, delay, or prevent a third party from acquiring us without the consent of our board of directors, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. Provisions of our charter documents that could have an anti-takeover effect include:\n\u2022\nthe classification of our board of directors into three groups so that directors serve staggered three-year terms, which may make it difficult for a potential acquirer to gain control of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement for super majority approval by stockholders for certain business combinations;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to authorize the issuance of shares of undesignated preferred stock without a vote by stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to amend or repeal our bylaws;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nlimitations on stockholders\u2019 ability to call special stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\ncertain restrictions in our charter on transfers of our common stock designed to preserve our federal NOLs.\nAt our 2009 annual meeting, our stockholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation that restricts any person or entity from attempting to transfer our stock, without prior permission from the Board of Directors, to the extent that such transfer would (i) create or result in an individual or entity becoming a five-percent stockholder of our stock, or (ii) increase the stock ownership percentage of any existing five-percent stockholder. This amendment provides that any transfer that violates its provisions shall be null and void and would require the purported transferee to, upon our demand, transfer the shares that exceed the five percent limit to an agent designated by us for the purpose of conducting a sale of such excess shares. This provision in our certificate of incorporation may make the acquisition of Blucora more expensive to the acquirer and could significantly delay, discourage, or prevent third parties from acquiring Blucora without the approval of our board of directors.", "PERMNO": 86544, "SIC": 6211, "TIC": "BCOR"}
