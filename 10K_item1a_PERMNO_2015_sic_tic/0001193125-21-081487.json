The following highlights some of the factors that have affected, and/or in the future could affect, our operations.\nThe following is a summary of certain important factors that may make an investment in our company speculative or risky. You should carefully consider the fuller risk factor disclosure set forth in this Annual Report, in addition to the other information herein, including the section of this report titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our financial statements and related notes.\n\u2022\nWe have incurred significant losses from inception through 2020 and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and sustain future profitability.\n\u2022\nOur quarterly and annual operating and financial results and our gross margins are likely to fluctuate significantly in future periods.\n\u2022\nWe expect the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)\npandemic to have a significant effect on our results of operations. In addition, it has resulted in significant financial market volatility, and its impact on the global economy appears to be significant. A continuation or worsening of the pandemic will have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition and on the market price of our common stock.\n\u2022\nThe markets for our products and treatments and newly introduced enhancements to our existing products and treatments may not develop as expected, we continue to face barriers to broad market acceptance.\n\u2022\nAn unfavorable resolution of the Yeda litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022\nSales and market acceptance of our products is dependent upon the coverage and reimbursement decisions made by third-party payers, including carve-out\nradiology benefits managers. The failure of third-party payers to provide appropriate levels of coverage and reimbursement, and/or meeting prior authorization and other requirements for approval to use our products and treatments facilitated by our products could harm our business and prospects.\n\u2022\nA limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our total revenue. The loss of a principal customer could seriously hurt our business.\n\u2022\nThe markets for many of our products are subject to changing technology.\n\u2022\nWe distribute our products in highly competitive markets and our sales may suffer as a result.\n\u2022\nWe rely on intellectual property and proprietary rights to maintain our competitive position and may not be able to protect these rights.\n\u2022\nOur future prospects depend on our ability to retain current key employees and attract additional qualified personnel.\n\u2022\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be volatile, which could reduce the market price of our common stock.\n\u2022\nFuture issuances of shares of our common stock may cause significant dilution of equity interests of existing holders of common stock and decrease the market price of shares of our common stock.\nRisks Related to our Financial Position, Operating Results and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred significant losses from inception through 2020 and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and sustain future profitability.\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception. We incurred a net loss of $17.6 million in 2020 and have an accumulated deficit of $241.9 million at December 31, 2020. We may not be able to achieve profitability.\nOur quarterly and annual operating and financial results and our gross margins are likely to fluctuate significantly in future periods.\nOur quarterly and annual operating and financial results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from period to period. Our revenue and results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors that are outside of our control including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, the timing of orders from our OEM partners, our OEM partners ability to manufacture and ship their digital mammography systems, our timely receipt by the FDA for the clearance or approval to market our products, our ability to timely engage other OEM partners for the sale of our products, the timing of product enhancements and new product introductions by us or our competitors, the pricing of our products, changes in customers\u2019 budgets, competitive conditions and the possible deferral of revenue under our revenue recognition policies.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Company\nWe expect the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)\npandemic to have a significant effect on our results of operations. In addition, it has resulted in significant financial market volatility, and its impact on the global economy appears to be significant. A continuation or worsening of the pandemic will have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition and on the market price of our common stock.\nOn March 12, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19\nto be a pandemic. In an effort to contain and mitigate the spread of the COVID-19\npandemic, the United States, many countries in Europe, as well as Canada and China, have imposed unprecedented restrictions on travel, and there have been business closures and a substantial reduction in economic activity in countries that have had significant outbreaks of COVID-19.\nAs a provider of devices and services to the health care industry, our operations have been materially affected. Significant uncertainty remains as to the continuing impact of the COVID-19\npandemic on our operations and on the global economy as a whole. It is currently not possible to predict how long the pandemic will last or the time that it will take for economic activity to return to prior levels. The COVID-19\npandemic has resulted in significant financial market volatility and uncertainty. A continuation or worsening of the levels of market disruption and volatility seen in the recent past will have an adverse effect on our ability to access capital, on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and on the market price of our common stock. Our results for the year ending December 31, 2020 reflect a negative impact from the COVID-19\npandemic, as the typical sales cycle and ordering patterns were still disrupted due to some healthcare facilities\u2019 additional focus on COVID-19.\nAlthough we do not provide guidance to investors relating to our results of operations, our results for future quarters could reflect a continuing negative impact from the COVID-19\npandemic for similar reasons. Depending upon the duration and severity of the pandemic, the continuing effect on our results over the long term is uncertain.\nThe impact of the COVID-19\npandemic on our future revenue is also relevant to the minimum revenue covenant under our Loan and Security Agreement (\u201cLoan Agreement\u201d) with Western Alliance Bank (the \u201cBank\u201d). If at any point the Company is not in compliance with this covenant and is unable to obtain an amendment or waiver from the Bank, such noncompliance may result in an event of default under the Loan Agreement, which could permit acceleration of the outstanding indebtedness and require the Company to repay such indebtedness before the scheduled due date. The Company was required, historically, to seek modifications from its prior lender to avoid non-compliance\nwith certain earlier covenants. With the COVID-19\npandemic affecting the world economy, the company cannot assure that it will be able to continue to satisfy the applicable minimum revenue covenant.\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to trade accounts receivable losses may increase if its customers are adversely affected by changes in healthcare laws, coverage, and reimbursement, economic pressures or uncertainty\nassociated with local or global economic recessions, disruption associated with the current COVID-19\npandemic, or other customer-specific factors. The Company has historically not experienced significant trade account receivable losses, but it is possible that there could be a material adverse impact from potential adjustments of the carrying amount of trade account receivables as hospitals\u2019 cash flows are impacted by their response to the COVID-19\npandemic.\nThe markets for our products and treatments and newly introduced enhancements to our existing products and treatments may not develop as expected, we continue to face barriers to broad market acceptance.\nThe successful commercialization of our newly developed products and treatments and newly introduced enhancements to our existing products and treatments are subject to numerous risks, both known and unknown, including:\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our products;\n\u2022\nuncertainty of the development of a market for such product or treatment;\n\u2022\ntrends relating to, or the introduction or existence of, competing products, technologies or alternative treatments or therapies that may be more effective, safer or easier to use than our products, technologies, treatments or therapies;\n\u2022\nthe perceptions of our products or treatments as compared to other products and treatments;\n\u2022\nrecommendation and support for the use of our products or treatments by influential customers, such as hospitals, radiological practices, breast surgeons and radiation oncologists and treatment centers and U.S. and international medical professional societies;\n\u2022\nthe availability and extent of data demonstrating the clinical efficacy of our products or treatments;\n\u2022\ncompetition, including the presence of competing products sold by companies with longer operating histories, more recognizable names and more established distribution networks; and\n\u2022\nother technological developments.\nOften, the development of a significant market for a product or treatment will depend upon the establishment of appropriate reimbursement for use of the product or treatment. Moreover, even if addressed, such reimbursement levels frequently are not established until after a product or treatment is developed and commercially introduced, which can delay the successful commercialization of a product or treatment.\nIf we are unable to successfully commercialize and create a significant market for our newly developed products and treatments and newly introduced enhancements to our existing products and treatments, our business and prospects could be harmed.\nUnfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect our financial results\nFrom time to time, we are a party to or otherwise involved in legal proceedings, claims and government inspections or investigations and other legal matters, both inside and outside the United States, arising in the ordinary course of our business or otherwise. Legal proceedings are often lengthy, taking place over a period of years with interim motions or judgments subject to multiple levels of review (such as appeals or rehearings) before the outcome is final. Litigation is subject to significant uncertainty and may be expensive, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations. For these and other reasons, we may choose to settle legal proceedings and claims, regardless of their actual merit.\nA legal proceeding finally resolved against us, could result in significant compensatory damages, and in certain circumstances, punitive or trebled damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief. If our existing insurance does not cover the amount or types of damages awarded, or if other resolutions or actions taken as a result of the legal proceeding were to restrain our ability to market one or more of our material products or services, our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, legal proceedings, and any adverse resolution thereof, can result in adverse publicity and damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact our business.\nAn unfavorable resolution of the Yeda litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn December 2016, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Invivo Corporation (\u201cInvivo\u201d). On September 5, 2018, a third-party, Yeda Research and Development Company Ltd., filed a complaint (the \u201cYeda Litigation\u201d) against the Company and Invivo in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, asserting various claims against the Company and Invivo. The Company and Invivo filed motions to dismiss the complaint. On September 5, 2019, the Court granted Invivo\u2019s Motion to Dismiss in its entirety and granted the Company\u2019s Motion to Dismiss as it relates to Yeda\u2019s breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets claims. On October 22, 2019, Yeda filed an Amended Complaint against only the Company asserting claims for (i) copyright infringement; and (ii) a replead breach of contract claim. The Company filed its Answer to Yeda\u2019s Amended Complaint on November 5, 2019. Yeda alleges, among other things, that the Company infringed upon Yeda\u2019s source code, which was originally licensed to the Company, by using it in the products that the Company sold to Invivo and that it is entitled to damages that could include, among other things, profits relating to the sales of these products. If the Company is found to have infringed Yeda\u2019s copyright or breached its agreements with Yeda, the Company could be obligated to pay to Yeda substantial monetary damages. We cannot predict the outcome of the Yeda Litigation or the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve the lawsuit. If such litigation were to be determined adversely to our interests, or if we were forced to settle such matter for a significant amount, such resolution or settlement could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Please refer to the detailed discussion regarding litigation set forth in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may be exposed to significant product liability for which we may not have sufficient insurance coverage or be able to procure sufficient insurance coverage.\nOur product and general liability insurance coverage may be inadequate with respect to potential claims and adequate insurance coverage may not be available in sufficient amounts or at a reasonable cost in the future. If available at all, product liability insurance for the medical device industry generally is expensive. Future product liability claims could be costly to defend and/or costly to resolve and could harm our reputation and business.\nSales and market acceptance of our products is dependent upon the coverage and reimbursement decisions made by third-party payers, including carve-out\nradiology benefits managers. The failure of third-party payers to provide appropriate levels of coverage and reimbursement, and/or meeting prior authorization and other requirements for approval to use our products and treatments facilitated by our products could harm our business and prospects.\nSales and market acceptance of our medical products and the treatments facilitated by our products in the United States and other countries is dependent upon the coverage decisions and reimbursement policies established by government healthcare programs and private health insurers. Market acceptance of our products\nand treatments has and will continue to depend upon our customers\u2019 ability to obtain an appropriate level of coverage for, and reimbursement from third-party payers for, these products and treatments. In the United States, CMS establishes coverage and reimbursement policies for healthcare providers treating Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Under current CMS policies, varying reimbursement levels have been established for our products and treatments. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage policies for Medicare patients may vary by regional Medicare Administrative Contractors. Reimbursement rates for treatments vary based on the geographic price index, the site of service, and other factors. Coverage and reimbursement policies and rates applicable to patients with private insurance are dependent upon individual private payer decisions which may not follow the policies and rates established by CMS. The use of our products and treatments outside the United States is similarly affected by coverage and reimbursement policies adopted by foreign governments and, to a lesser extent, private insurance carriers. On September 18, 2020, CMS finalized a rule regarding its new RO Model, designed, according to CMS, to improve the quality of care for cancer patients receiving radiotherapy and reduce Medicare expenditures through bundled payments. In the final notice, CMS did not include IORT treatments (including CPT codes 77424 and 77425) within the new alternative payment model for radiation oncology. As a result, whether or not a particular physician practice or hospital is subject to the new radiation oncology payment model, IORT services covered by Medicare will continue to be subject to the existing payment systems for physician services and hospital outpatient services. On December 2, 2020, CMS announced the interim final rule related to CMS\u2019s new RO Model, which will take effect no earlier than January 1, 2022. We cannot provide assurance that government or private third-party payers will continue to reimburse our products or services, nor can we provide assurance that the payment rates will be adequate. If providers and physicians are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement for our products or services, this could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. In addition, in the event that the current methodology for calculating payment for these products or services changes, this could have a material adverse effect on our business and business operations. We cannot guarantee that providers and physicians will be able to obtain adequate reimbursement for our products or services under the RO model as proposed, or at all.\nOur business is dependent upon future market growth of full field digital mammography systems, digital computer aided detection products, and tomosynthesis as well as advanced image analysis and workflow solutions for use with MRI and CT and the market growth of electronic brachytherapy. This growth may not occur or may occur too slowly to benefit us\n.\nOur future business is substantially dependent on the continued growth in the market for electronic brachytherapy, full field digital mammography systems, digital computer aided detection products and tomosynthesis as well as advanced image analysis and workflow solutions for use with MRI and CT. The market for these products may not continue to develop or may develop at a slower rate than we anticipate due to a variety of factors, including, general economic conditions, delays in hospital spending for capital equipment, the significant costs associated with the procurement of full field digital mammography systems and CAD products and MRI and CT systems and the reliance on third party insurance reimbursement. If the market for the products and technologies upon which our products are dependent does not grow or grows too slowly, this could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our total revenue. The loss of a principal customer could seriously hurt our business.\nA limited number of major customers have in the past and may continue in the future to account for a significant portion of our revenue. Our principal\nsales distribution channel for our digital products is through our OEM partners. In 2020, our OEM partners accounted for 28% of our total revenue, with one major customer, GE Healthcare, accounting for 17% of our revenue. In addition, in 2020, five customers, consisting of both OEM and direct customers, accounted for 37% of our total revenue. The loss of our relationships with principal customers or a decline in sales to principal customers could materially adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIf goodwill and/or other intangible assets that we have recorded in connection with our acquisitions become impaired, we could have to take significant charges against earnings.\nIn connection with the accounting for our acquisitions, we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets. We have recorded multiple impairments in the past: $26.8 million in September 2011, $14.0 million in June 2015, $4.7 million in September 2017 and $2.0 million in December 2017. Under current accounting, we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of our goodwill of $8.4 million at December 31, 2020 and our other intangible assets have been impaired. Any reduction or impairment of the value of goodwill or other intangible assets will result in a charge against earnings which could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations in future periods.\nOur effective tax rate may fluctuate, and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of amounts that have been accrued.\nAs a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. In preparing our financial statements, we record the amount of tax payable in each of the countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Our future effective tax rate, however, may be lower or higher than prior years due to numerous factors, including a change in our geographic earnings mix, changes in the measurement of our deferred taxes, and recently enacted and future tax law changes in jurisdictions in which we operate. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions, and tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryovers and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), a corporation is generally allowed a deduction for net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) carried over from a prior taxable year. Under that provision, we can carryforward our NOLs to offset our future taxable income, if any, until such NOLs are used or expire. The same is true of other unused tax attributes, such as tax credits. Under the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), federal net operating losses incurred in 2018 and in future years may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal net operating losses is limited. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the federal Tax Act.\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the Code, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percent change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change\nnet operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change\ntax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If an ownership change occurs and our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations.\nAcquisitions may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect.\nWe integrate companies that we acquire including the operations, services, products and personnel of each company within our management policies, procedures and strategies. We cannot be sure that we will achieve the benefits of revenue growth that we expect from these acquisitions or that we will not incur unforeseen additional costs or expenses in connection with these acquisitions. To effectively manage our expected future growth, we must continue to successfully manage our integration of these companies and continue to improve our operational systems, internal procedures, working capital management, and financial and operational controls. If we fail in any of these areas, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe markets for many of our products are subject to changing technology.\nOur business depends on our ability to adapt to evolving technologies and industry standards and introduce new technology solutions and services accordingly. If we cannot adapt to changing technologies, our technology solutions and services may become obsolete, and our business may suffer. Because the healthcare information technology market is constantly evolving, our existing technology may become obsolete and fail to meet the requirements of current and potential customers. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to enhance our existing technology solutions and services, develop new technology that addresses the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our customers, and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost-effective basis. The development of our proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks. We may not be successful in developing, using, marketing, selling, or maintaining new technologies effectively or adapting our proprietary technology to evolving customer requirements or emerging industry standards, and, as a result, our business and reputation could suffer. We may not be able to introduce new technology solutions on schedule, or at all, or such solutions may not achieve market acceptance. Moreover, competitors may develop competitive products that could adversely affect our results of operations. Our failure to introduce new products or to introduce these products on schedule could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend upon a limited number of suppliers and manufacturers for our products, and certain components in our products may be available from a sole or limited number of suppliers.\nOur products are generally either manufactured and assembled for us by a sole manufacturer, by a limited number of manufacturers or assembled by us from supplies we obtain from a limited number of suppliers. Critical components required to manufacture our products, whether by outside manufacturers or directly by us, may be available from a sole or limited number of component suppliers. We generally do not have long-term arrangements with any of our manufacturers or suppliers. The loss of a sole or key manufacturer or supplier could materially impair our ability to deliver products to our customers in a timely manner and would adversely affect our sales and operating results. Our business would be harmed if any of our manufacturers or suppliers could not meet our quality and performance specifications and quantity and delivery requirements.\nAdditionally, our suppliers and manufacturers are, and will continue to be, subject to extensive government regulation in connection with the manufacture of any medical devices. Our suppliers and manufacturers must ensure that they are compliant with applicable quality system and other regulatory requirements, as mandated by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. If our materials suppliers or manufacturers face manufacturing or quality control problems this may lead to delays in product production or shipment or our supplier or manufacturer no longer being able to continue operations. Our business would be harmed if any of our manufacturers or suppliers could not meet our quality and performance specifications and quantity and delivery requirements.\nWe distribute our products in highly competitive markets and our sales may suffer as a result.\nWe operate in highly competitive and rapidly changing markets that contain competitive products available from nationally and internationally recognized companies. Many of these competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than us and are well established. In addition, some companies have developed or may develop technologies or products that could compete with the products we manufacture and distribute or that would render our products obsolete or noncompetitive. Our competitors may achieve patent protection, regulatory approval, or product commercialization that would limit our ability to compete with them. These and other competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDisruptions in service or damage to our third-party providers\u2019 data centers could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on third parties who provide access to data centers. Our information technologies and systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from various causes, including (i) acts of God and other natural disasters, war and acts of terrorism and (ii) power losses, computer systems failures, internet and telecommunications or data network failures, operator error, losses of and corruption of data and similar events. We conduct business continuity planning and work with our third-party providers to protect against fires, floods, other natural disasters and general business interruptions to mitigate the adverse effects of a disruption, relocation or change in operating environment at the data centers we utilize. In addition, the occurrence of any of these events could result in interruptions, delays or cessations in service to our customers. Any of these events could impair or prohibit our ability to provide our services, reduce the attractiveness of our services to current or potential customers and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, despite the implementation of security measures, our infrastructure, data centers, or systems that we interface with, including the Internet and related systems, may be vulnerable to physical break-ins,\nhackers, improper employee or contractor access, computer viruses, programming errors, denial-of-service\nattacks or other attacks by third-parties seeking to disrupt operations or misappropriate information or similar physical or electronic breaches of security. Any of these can cause system failure, including network, software or hardware failure, which can result in service disruptions. As a result, we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches and hackers or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches.\nIf our products fail to perform properly due to errors or similar problems, our business could suffer.\nDespite testing, complex software; may contain defects or errors. Addressing software errors may delay development of our solutions, and if discovered after deployment, may require the expenditure of substantial time and resources to correct. Errors in our software could result in:\n\u2022\nharm to our reputation;\n\u2022\nlost sales;\n\u2022\ndelays in commercial releases;\n\u2022\nproduct liability claims;\n\u2022\ndelays in or loss of market acceptance of our solutions;\n\u2022\nlicense terminations or renegotiations;\n\u2022\nunexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy errors; and\n\u2022\nprivacy and security vulnerabilities.\nFurthermore, our customers might use our software together with products from other companies or those that they have developed internally. As a result, when problems occur, it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem. Even when our software does not cause these problems, the existence of these errors might cause us to incur significant costs, divert the attention of our technical personnel from our solution development efforts; impact our reputation and cause significant customer relations problems.\nWe rely on intellectual property and proprietary rights to maintain our competitive position and may not be able to protect these rights.\nWe rely heavily on proprietary technology that we protect primarily through licensing arrangements, patents, trade secrets, proprietary know-how\nand non-disclosure\nagreements. There can be no assurance that any pending or future patent applications will be granted or that any current or future patents, regardless of whether we are an owner or a licensee of the patent, will not be challenged, rendered unenforceable, invalidated, or circumvented or that the rights will provide a competitive advantage to us. There can also be no assurance that our trade secrets or non-disclosure\nagreements will provide meaningful protection of our proprietary information. Further, we cannot assure you that others will not independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us or that our technology will not infringe upon patents or other rights owned by others. Unauthorized third parties may infringe our intellectual property rights or copy or reverse engineer portions of our technology. In addition, because patent applications in the United States are not generally publicly disclosed until eighteen months after the application is filed, applications may have been filed by third parties that relate to our technology. Moreover, there is a risk that foreign intellectual property laws will not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as intellectual property laws in the United States. The rights provided by a patent are finite in time. The Company has certain patents that expire between 2021 and 2029. In the absence of significant patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products, processes or technology.\nIn addition, in the future, we may be required to assert infringement claims against third parties, and there can be no assurance that one or more parties will not assert infringement claims against us. Any resulting litigation or proceeding could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our management personnel, whether or not such litigation or proceeding is determined in our favor. In addition, if any of our intellectual property and proprietary rights are deemed to violate the proprietary rights of others, we may be prevented from using those intellectual property or proprietary rights, which could prevent us from being able to sell our products. Litigation could also result in a judgment or monetary damages being levied against us.\nHealthcare industry consolidation could impose pressure on our prices, reduce potential customer base and reduce demands for our systems.\nMany hospitals and imaging centers have consolidated to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater market and purchasing power. When hospitals and imaging centers combine, they often consolidate infrastructure, and consolidation of our customers could result in fewer overall customers. If this consolidation trend continues, it could reduce the size of our potential customer base, reduce demand for our systems, give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining or purchasing power, and may lead to erosion of the prices for our systems or decreased margins for our systems, all of which would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue.\nClinical trials are very expensive, lengthy, and difficult to design and implement and have uncertain outcomes, and, as a result, we may suffer delays or suspensions in current or future trials which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain regulatory approvals timely or at all, and if we fail to receive such approvals, our ability to generate revenues.\nClinical trials involve a time-consuming and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and the results of earlier trials are not necessarily predictive of future results. Human clinical trials are difficult to design and implement and very expensive, due in part to being subject to rigorous regulatory requirements.\nAdditionally, we may encounter problems at any stage of the trials that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials. The commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by several factors, including:\n\u2022\nnon-approval\nof an investigational device exemption (IDE), which is required by the FDA for the study in humans of a significant risk device that is not approved for the indication being studied;\n\u2022\nfailure to reach an agreement with contract research organizations or clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\nfailure of third-party contract research organizations to properly implement or monitor the clinical trial protocols;\n\u2022\nfailure of IRBs to approve our clinical trial protocols or suspension or termination of our clinical trial by the IRB, DSMB, or the FDA;\n\u2022\nslower than expected rates of patient recruitment and enrollment, which may be further negatively impacted by the COVID-19\nglobal pandemic;\n\u2022\ninability to retain patients in clinical trials, which may be further negatively impacted by the COVID-19\nglobal pandemic;\n\u2022\nlack of effectiveness during clinical trials;\n\u2022\nunforeseen safety issues;\n\u2022\ninability or unwillingness of medical clinical investigators and institutional review boards to follow our clinical trial protocols;\n\u2022\nfailure of clinical investigators or sites to maintain necessary licenses or permits or comply with good clinical practices, or GCP, or other regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022\nlack of sufficient funding to finance the clinical trials.\nIn addition, we or regulatory authorities may suspend our clinical trials at any time if it appears that we are exposing participants to unacceptable health risks or if the regulatory authorities find deficiencies in our regulatory submissions or the conduct of these trials. Any suspension of clinical trials will delay possible regulatory approval, increase costs, and adversely impact our ability to develop products and generate revenue.\nOur future prospects depend on our ability to retain current key employees and attract additional qualified personnel.\nOur success depends in large part on the continued service of our executive officers and other key employees. We may not be able to retain the services of our executive officers and other key employees. The loss of executive officers or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn addition, in order to support our continued growth, we will be required to effectively recruit, develop and retain additional qualified personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain additional necessary personnel, it could delay or hinder our plans for growth. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully attract, assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. The failure to retain and attract necessary personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur international operations expose us to various risks, any number of which could harm our business.\nOur revenue from sales outside of the United States represented approximately 20% of our revenue for 2020. We are subject to the risks inherent in conducting business across national boundaries, any one of which could adversely impact our business. In addition to currency fluctuations, these risks include, among other things: economic downturns; changes in or interpretations of local law, governmental policy or regulation; changes in healthcare practice patterns; restrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of the country; varying tax systems; and government protectionism. One or more of the foregoing factors could impair our current or future operations and, as a result, harm our overall business.\nOur existing and future debt obligations could impair our liquidity and financial condition, and our lenders could foreclose on our assets in the event we are unable to meet our debt obligations.\nIn connection with our Loan Agreement, the Bank agreed to provide up an initial term loan facility of $7.0 million and a $5.0 million revolving line of credit. The Loan Agreement requires the Company to either (i) meet a minimum revenue covenant, or (ii) maintain a ratio of unrestricted cash at the Bank to aggregate indebtedness owed to the Bank of at least 1.25 to 1.00. The Company was compliant with these covenants as of December 31, 2020 but cannot provide any assurance as to its future compliance due to, in part, the uncertainty of the effect of the COVID-19\npandemic on the world economy and the U.S. health system. If at any point the Company is not in compliance with certain covenants under the Loan Agreement and is unable to obtain an amendment or waiver, such noncompliance may result in an event of default under the Loan Agreement, which could permit acceleration of the outstanding indebtedness and require the Company to repay such indebtedness before the scheduled due date. The Company was required, periodically in the past, to seek modifications from its prior lender to avoid non-compliance\nwith its earlier covenants.\nThe Loan Agreement\n\u2022\nrequires us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow to payments on our debt obligations, which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nimposes restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, other than permitted indebtedness, and could impede us from obtaining additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, mergers, acquisitions and general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nimposes restrictions on us with respect to the use of our available cash, including in connection with future acquisitions;\n\u2022\nrequires us to agree by a certain date with the Bank regarding minimum revenue levels for the 2021 calendar year. Failure to agree will result in acceleration of the indebtedness under the Loan Agreement; and\n\u2022\nrequires us to provide certain financial information on a monthly and annual basis. Failure to do so will result in acceleration of the indebtedness under the Loan Agreement.\nIn addition, the Loan Agreement\n\u2022\ncould impair our liquidity;\n\u2022\ncould make it more difficult for us to satisfy our other obligations;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business prospects and could limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our licensing markets;\n\u2022\ncould result in a prepayment or make-whole premium if we elected to prepay the indebtedness under the Loan Agreement prior to its maturity date; and\n\u2022\ncould place us at a competitive disadvantage when compared to our competitors who have less debt.\nWe have pledged substantially all of our assets to secure our obligations under the Loan Agreement. If we were to fail in the future to make any required payment under the Loan Agreement or fail to comply with the financial and operating covenants contained in the therein, in some cases subject to applicable cure periods, we would be in default regarding the Loan Agreement. Such default would enable the lenders under the Loan Agreement to foreclose on the assets securing such debt and could significantly diminish the market value and marketability of our common stock and could result in the acceleration of the payment obligations under our indebtedness.\nRisks Related to Regulation of our Industry\nThe healthcare industry is highly regulated, and government authorities may determine that we have failed to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations. Additionally, we may incur substantial costs defending our interpretations of U.S. federal and state government regulations, and if we lose, the government could force us to restructure our operations and subject us to fines, monetary penalties and possibly exclude us from participation in U.S. government-sponsored health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\nBoth in the United States and in other jurisdictions, the healthcare industry is subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, compliance with which imposes substantial costs on us. Such laws and regulations include those that are directed at payment for services and the conduct of operations, preventing fraud and abuse, and prohibiting general business corporations, such as ours, from engaging in practices that may influence professional decision-making, such as splitting fees with physicians. In addition, we believe that our business will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as legislatures and governmental agencies periodically consider proposals to revise or create new requirements, particularly in response to and following the COVID-19\npandemic, the scope and effect of which we cannot predict. Such proposals, if implemented, could impact our operations, the use of our services, and our ability to market new services, and could create unexpected liabilities for us.\nMany healthcare laws are complex, and their application to specific services and relationships may not be clear. The laws often have related rules and regulations that are subject to interpretation and may not provide definitive guidance as to their application to our operations, including our arrangements with physicians and professional corporations. Further, healthcare laws differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and it is difficult to ensure our business complies with evolving laws in all jurisdictions.\nConsequently, our operations, including our arrangements with healthcare providers, are subject to audits, inquiries and investigations from government agencies from time to time. We believe we are in substantial compliance with these laws, rules and regulations based upon what we believe are reasonable and defensible interpretations of these laws, rules and regulations. However, U.S. federal and state laws are broadly worded and may be interpreted or applied by prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authorities in ways that we cannot predict. Accordingly, we may in the future become the subject of regulatory or other investigations or proceedings, and our interpretations of applicable laws, rules and regulations may be challenged. Any challenge to our operations or arrangements with third parties that we have structured based upon our interpretation of these laws, rules and regulations could potentially disrupt business operations and lead to substantial defense\ncosts and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention, even if we successfully defend our interpretation. In addition, if the government successfully challenges our interpretation of the applicability of these laws, rules and regulations as they relate to our operations and arrangements, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.\nIn the event regulatory action were to limit or prohibit us from carrying on our business as we presently conduct it or from expanding our operations into certain jurisdictions, we may need to make structural, operational and organizational modifications to our Company or our contractual arrangements with physicians and professional corporations. Our operating costs could increase significantly as a result. We could also lose contracts, or our revenues could decrease under existing contracts. Any restructuring would also negatively impact our operations because our management\u2019s time and attention would be diverted from running our business in the ordinary course.\nCompliance with the many laws and regulations governing the healthcare industry could restrict our sales and marketing practices, and other relationships with healthcare professionals.\nOnce our products are sold, we must comply with various U.S. federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, rules and regulations pertaining false claims, kickbacks and physician self-referral. Violations of the fraud and abuse laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration health programs, workers\u2019 compensation programs and TRICARE. Compliance with these laws could restrict our sales and marketing practices, and any challenge to our practices could disrupt our operations and lead to substantial defense costs and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention, even if we successfully defend our practices. If we are unable to successfully defend our practices, in addition to incurring significant expense in defending ourselves, we could be subject to a significant settlement, monetary penalties, and costs related to implementation of changes to our practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nHealthcare reform legislation in the United States may adversely affect our business and/or results of operations.\nIn March 2010, significant reforms to the U.S. healthcare system were adopted in the form of the ACA. The ACA includes provisions that, among other things, reduce and/or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions) and impose new and/or increased taxes. While the ACA is intended to expand health insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the United States, other elements of this legislation, such as Medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs, comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies, make it difficult to determine the overall impact on sales of, and reimbursement for, our products. We are unable to predict what additional legislation or regulation relating to the health care industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation or regulation would have on our business. Any cost containment measures or other health care system reforms that are adopted could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to commercialize our existing and future products successfully. We cannot predict whether the ACA will be repealed, replaced, or modified or how such repeal, replacement or modification may be timed or structured. As a result, we cannot quantify or predict the effect of such repeal, replacement, or modification might have on our business and results of operations. However, any changes that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur products and manufacturing facilities are subject to extensive regulation with potentially significant costs for compliance.\nIn the United States, our CAD systems and Xoft Systems are medical devices subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the FDCA. The FDA\u2019s regulation of our products includes our manufacturing operations, product labeling, adverse event reporting, and the FDA\u2019s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or \u201coff-label\u201d\nuses.\nOur failure to fully comply with applicable regulations could result in the issuance of warning letters, non-approvals,\nsuspensions of existing approvals, civil penalties and criminal fines, product seizures and recalls, operating restrictions, injunctions, and criminal prosecution. Moreover, unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new requirements could increase our operating and compliance burdens and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSales of our products in certain countries outside of the United States are also subject to extensive regulatory approvals. Obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approvals is an expensive and time-consuming process. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals timely or at all in any foreign country in which we plan to market our CAD products and Xoft Systems, and if we fail to receive such approvals, our ability to generate revenue may be significantly diminished.\nWe may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for any of the other products that we may consider developing.\nWe have received the required premarket approvals from FDA or the equivalent foreign authority in the relevant jurisdictions in which we currently offer our products. Before we are able to commercialize any new product or promote a new indicated use of an existing product, we must obtain the required regulatory approvals. The process for satisfying these regulatory requirements is lengthy and costly and will require us to comply with complex standards for research and development, clinical trials, testing, manufacturing, quality control, labeling, and promotion of products. Additionally, even if we receive regulatory approval for a new product or indicated use in one jurisdiction, our products may be subject to separate regulatory approval in each country or jurisdiction in which we plan to market our products. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals timely or at all in any country or jurisdiction. Successfully obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction does not guarantee approval in another; however, a delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may negatively affect the regulatory process in another. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for other products or indicated uses, our ability to generate sufficient revenue to continue our business may be significantly impacted.\nOur products may be recalled even after we have received FDA or other governmental approval or clearance.\nIf the safety or efficacy of any of our products is called into question, we may initiate or the FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries may press us to implement or even require a product recall, even if our product received approval or clearance by the FDA or a similar governmental body. Such a recall would divert the focus of our management and our financial resources and could materially and adversely affect our reputation with customers and our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and other matters. We may be subject to criminal or civil sanctions if we fail to comply with privacy and security regulations regarding the use and disclosure of sensitive personally identifiable information.\nNumerous state and federal laws and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, privacy, confidentiality, security, availability and integrity of personally identifiable information, including HIPAA. In the provision of services to our customers, we and our third-party vendors may collect, use, maintain and transmit patient health information in ways that are subject to many of these laws and regulations. We are also subject to laws and regulations in foreign countries covering data privacy and other protection of health and employee information that may be more onerous than corresponding U.S. laws, including in particular the laws of Europe.\nOur customers are covered entities, and we are a business associate of our customers under HIPAA as a result of our contractual obligations to perform certain functions on behalf of and provide certain services to those customers. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including personally identifiable information received from of our customers. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures and business controls, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers, breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions or subject to the inadvertent or intentional unauthorized release of information. Any such occurrence could compromise our networks and the information stored thereon could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information by us or our subcontractors could (i) result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information and regulatory penalties, (ii) disrupt our operations and the services we provide to our customers and (iii) damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our profitability, revenue and competitive position.\nFederal and state consumer laws are being applied increasingly by the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general to regulate the collection, use and disclosure of personal or patient health information, through web sites or otherwise, and to regulate the presentation of web site content. Numerous other federal and state laws protect the confidentiality, privacy, availability, integrity and security of personally identifiable information. These laws in many cases are more restrictive than, and not preempted by, HIPAA and may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and our customers and potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability. We may not remain in compliance with the diverse privacy requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business.\nHIPAA and federal and state laws and regulations may require users of personally identifiable information to implement specified security measures. Evolving laws and regulations in this area could require us to incur significant additional costs to re-design\nour products in a timely manner to reflect these legal requirements, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nNew personally identifiable information standards, whether implemented pursuant to HIPAA, congressional action or otherwise, could have a significant effect on the manner in which we must handle healthcare related data, and the cost of complying with standards could be significant. If we do not properly comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to patient health information, we could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions.\nData protection laws in the United States, Europe and around the world may restrict our activities and increase our costs.\nVarious statutes and rules in the United States, Europe and around the world regulate privacy and data protection which may affect our collection, use, storage, and transfer of information both abroad and in the United States. New laws and regulations are being enacted, so that this area remains in a state of flux. Monitoring and complying with these laws require substantial financial resources. Failure to comply with these laws may result in, among other things, civil and criminal liability, negative publicity, restrictions on further use of data, and/or liability under contractual warranties. In addition, changes in these laws (including newly released interpretations of these laws by courts and regulatory bodies) may limit our data access, use and disclosure, and may require increased expenditures by us.\nThe European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) requires us to meet new and more stringent requirements regarding the handling of personal data about EU residents. Failure to meet the GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue.\nRisk Related to our Common Stock\nA substantial number of shares of our common stock are eligible for future sale, and the sale of shares of common stock into the market, or the perception that such sales may occur, may depress our stock price.\nSales of substantial additional shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, may significantly lower the market price of our common stock. We are unable to estimate the amount, timing or nature of future sales of shares of our common stock. We have previously issued a substantial number of shares of common stock, which are eligible for resale under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), and may become freely tradable. We have also registered shares that are issuable upon the exercise of options and warrants. If holders of options, or warrants choose to exercise or convert their securities and sell shares of common stock issued upon the such exercise or conversion in the public market, or if holders of currently restricted common stock choose to sell such shares of common stock in the public market under Rule 144 or otherwise, or attempt to publicly sell such shares all at once or in a short time period, the prevailing market price for our common stock may decline.\nWe have a limited number of shares of common stock available for future issuance which could adversely affect our ability to raise capital or consummate acquisitions.\nWe are currently authorized to issue 30,000,000 shares of common stock under our amended Certificate of Incorporation (\u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d). As of December 31, 2020, we had issued 23,508,575 shares of common stock and had approximately 1,869,507 shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of options granted, 29,166 shares of common stock reserved for vesting of restricted stock and 907,394 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. On March 5, 2021, we closed an underwritten public offering of 1,393,738 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $18.00 per share, such that as the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K\nwe have issued 24,918,458 shares of common stock.\nDue to the limited number of authorized shares of common stock available for issuance, we may not be able to raise additional equity capital or complete a merger, other business combination or partnership unless we increase the number of shares we are authorized to issue. We intend to seek stockholder approval to increase the number of our authorized shares of common stock at our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, but we can provide no assurance that we will succeed in amending our Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of shares of common stock we are authorized to issue.\nIf we do not receive the requisite stockholder approval, our operations could be materially adversely impacted. In addition, an increase in the authorized number of shares of common stock and the subsequent issuance of such shares could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company without further action by our stockholders.\nProvisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and in Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, discourage a takeover and adversely affect existing stockholders.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by our Board of Directors, without further action by stockholders, and may include, among other things, voting rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular matters), preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights, and sinking fund provisions. Although there are currently no shares of preferred stock outstanding, future holders of preferred stock may have rights superior to our common stock and such rights could also be used to restrict our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party.\nWe\nare\nalso subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware\nGeneral Corporation Law,\nwhich could prevent us\nfrom engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with\na 15% or greater\nstockholder\u201d for a period of three years\nfrom the date such person acquired that status unless appropriate board or stockholder approvals are obtained.\nThese provisions could deter unsolicited takeovers or delay or prevent changes in our control or management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price. These provisions may also limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be volatile, which could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nThe publicly traded shares of our common stock have experienced, and may experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations.\nThis market volatility\ncould reduce the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance. In addition, the trading price of our common stock could change significantly in response to actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results, announcements by us or our competitors, factors affecting the medical imaging industry generally, changes in national or regional economic conditions, changes in securities analysts\u2019 estimates for us or our competitors\u2019 or industry\u2019s future performance or general market conditions,\nmaking it more difficult for shares of our common stock to be sold at a favorable price or at all. The market price of our common stock could also be reduced by general market price declines or market volatility in the future or future declines or volatility in the prices of stocks for companies in our industry.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer and could subject us to substantial liabilities.\nIf our security measures are breached or fail and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer\u2019s data, our service may be perceived as insecure, the attractiveness of our services to current or potential customers may be reduced, and we may incur significant liabilities.\nOur services involve the storage and transmission of customers\u2019 proprietary information and patient information, including health, financial, payment and other personal or confidential information. We rely on proprietary and commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring, as well as other processes, to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of such information. Because of the sensitivity of this information and due to requirements under applicable laws and regulations, the effectiveness of such security efforts is very important. However, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to cybersecurity incidents that bypass our security measures, impact the integrity, availability or privacy of personally identifiable information or other data subject to privacy laws or disrupt our information systems, devices or business, including our ability to deliver services to our customers. As a result, cybersecurity, physical security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our enterprise, information systems and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The occurrence of any of these events could result in (i) harm to customers; (ii) business interruptions and delays; (iii) the loss, misappropriation, corruption or unauthorized access of data; (iv) litigation, including potential class action litigation, and potential liability under privacy, security and consumer protection laws or other applicable laws; (v) reputational damage; and (vi) federal and state governmental inquiries, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and harm our business reputation.\nChanges in interpretation or application of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe prepare our financial statements to conform to GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC and various other regulatory or accounting bodies. A change in interpretations of, or our application of, these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced. In addition, when we are required to adopt new accounting standards, our methods of accounting for certain items may change, which could cause our results of operations to fluctuate from period to period and make it more difficult to compare our financial results to prior periods.\nAs our operations evolve over time, we may introduce new products or new technologies that require us to apply different accounting principles, including ones regarding revenue recognition, than we have applied in past periods. The application of different types of accounting principles and related potential changes may make it more difficult to compare our financial results from quarter to quarter, and the trading price of our common stock could suffer or become more volatile as a result.\nWe cannot be certain of the future effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting or the impact of the same on our operations or the market price for our common stock.\nPursuant to\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSection 404\u201d),\nwe are required to\ninclude in our Annual Report on Form 10-K\nour assessment of\nthe effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nWe have dedicated a significant amount of time and resources to ensure compliance with this legislation for the year ended December 31, 2020 and will continue to do so for future fiscal periods. Although we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place, we cannot be certain that our\ninternal controls over financial reporting will continue to be effective. If we cannot adequately maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock.\nChanges in credit markets or to our credit rating could impact our ability to obtain financing for business operations or result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense.\nOur credit ratings reflect each credit rating agency\u2019s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations at the time such opinion is issued. We utilize the short- and long-term debt markets to obtain capital from time to time. Adverse changes in our credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term borrowing facilities and may limit financing options, including access to the unsecured borrowing market. Such changes may also breach restrictive covenants under current or future debt facilities or instruments, which could reduce our operating flexibility. Macroeconomic conditions, such as continued or increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets, may adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures or fund new acquisitions.\nFuture issuances of shares of our common stock may cause significant dilution of equity interests of existing holders of common stock and decrease the market price of shares of our common stock.\nWe have previously issued options that are exercisable or convertible into a significant number of shares of our common stock. Should existing holders of options exercise their options for shares of our common stock, it may cause significant dilution of equity interests of existing holders of our common stock and reduce the market price of shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 88779, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "ICAD"}
