Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common shares or other securities is subject to risks inherent in our businesses and the industries in which we operate. Described below are certain risks and uncertainties, the occurrences of which could have a material adverse effect on us. The risks and uncertainties described below include known material risks that we face currently, but our material risks are constantly evolving and the below descriptions may not include future risks that are not presently known, that are not currently believed to be material or that are common to all businesses. Although we have extensive risk management policies, practices and procedures in place that are aimed to mitigate these risks, the occurrence of these uncertainties may nevertheless impair our business operations and adversely affect the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. Before making an investment decision, investors should consider carefully all of the risks described below together with the other information included in this report and the other reports we file with the SEC.\nManagement has identified several categories of material risk that we are subject to, including: (I) economic and market, (II) regulatory, (III) financial, (IV) operational, (V) development and sustainability and (VI) human capital. Although the risks are organized by these headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated.\nI. ECONOMIC AND MARKET RISKS\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our businesses.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is continuing to impact countries, communities, supply chains and markets. Responses by individuals, governments and businesses to the COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to reduce its spread, including quarantines, travel restrictions, business closures, and mandatory stay-at-home or work-from-home orders, have led to significant disruptions to overall business and economic activity. While vaccines are now being manufactured and distributed, it is currently unknown when or whether the economy will return to pre-pandemic levels of consumer and business activity.\nDuring 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected our businesses by temporarily curtailing certain of our end markets. In particular, the automotive industry, which we rely on directly and indirectly for a significant amount of our sales, was severely disrupted during the first half of 2020. The slowdown in the automotive industry led, in turn, to disruptions to our operations. For example, although our steel and mining operations are considered \u201cessential\u201d by the states in which we operate, certain of our mining and production facilities were idled for various periods during 2020 in response to the decrease in customer demand. While we were able to resume operations at many of these facilities later in 2020, we cannot predict whether any other production facilities or mines will experience disruptions in the future as a result of adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the risk that a significant portion of our workforce and on-site contractors will suffer illness or otherwise be unable to perform their ordinary work functions. While we instituted remote work policies where practical across our footprint, the safe and responsible operation of our production facilities often requires that workers be on-site. Accordingly, during 2020, we experienced direct and indirect workforce impacts from COVID-19 at many of our operations. We also may need to reduce our workforce as a result of declines in our business caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to rehire our workforce once our business has recovered. We may also experience supply chain disruptions or operational issues with our vendors, as our suppliers and contractors face similar challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBecause the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, we cannot predict the full extent to which our businesses, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity will ultimately be impacted. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our businesses, it may also have the effect of exacerbating many of the other risks described in this \u2018\u2018Risk Factors\u2019\u2019 section, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe volatility of commodity prices, including steel and iron ore, affects our ability to generate revenue, maintain stable cash flows and fund our operations, including growth and expansion projects.\nOur profitability is dependent upon the prices of the steel and iron ore products that we sell to our customers and the prices of the products our customers sell. As an integrated producer of steel and iron ore, we experience direct impacts of steel price fluctuations through customer sales, as well as direct and indirect impacts of iron ore price fluctuations through third-party sales and the impacts that fluctuations in iron ore prices have on steel prices. The prices of steel and iron ore have fluctuated significantly in the past and are affected by factors beyond our control, including: international demand for raw materials used in steel production; rates of global economic growth, especially\nconstruction and infrastructure activity that requires significant amounts of steel; changes in the levels of economic activity in the U.S., China, India, Europe and other industrialized or developing economies; changes in China\u2019s emissions policies and environmental compliance enforcement practices; changes in the production capacity, production rate and inventory levels of other steel producers and iron ore suppliers; changes in trade laws; volumes of unfairly traded imports; imposition or termination of duties, tariffs, import and export controls and other trade barriers impacting the steel and iron ore markets; weather-related disruptions, infectious disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or natural disasters that may impact the global supply of steel or iron ore; and the proximity, capacity and cost of infrastructure and transportation.\nOur earnings, therefore, may fluctuate with the prices of the products we sell and of the products our customers sell. To the extent that the prices of steel and iron ore, including the hot-rolled coil steel price, coated and other specialty steel prices, the Platts 62% Price, pellet premiums and Platts international indexed freight rates, significantly decline for an extended period of time, whether due to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, we may have to further revise our operating plans, including curtailing production, reducing operating costs and capital expenditures, and discontinuing certain exploration and development programs. We also may have to take impairments on our goodwill, intangible assets, long-lived assets and/or inventory. Sustained lower prices also could cause us to further reduce existing mineral reserves if certain reserves no longer can be economically mined or processed at prevailing prices. We may be unable to decrease our costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues and may incur losses. These events could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe sell a significant portion of our steel products to the automotive market and fluctuations or changes in the automotive market could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance.\nFor the full-year 2020, approximately 40% of AK Steel\u2019s and ArcelorMittal USA's combined sales were to the automotive market. Beyond these direct sales to the automotive industry, we make additional sales to distributors and converters, which may ultimately resell some of that volume to the automotive market. In addition to the size of our exposure to the automotive industry, we face risks arising from our relative concentration of sales to certain specific automotive manufacturers, including several significant customers that idled certain automotive production facilities in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, automotive production and sales are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors, including interest rates, consumer credit, and consumer spending and preferences, as well as the current COVID-19 pandemic. If automotive production and sales decline, our sales and shipments to the automotive market are likely to decline in a corresponding manner. Adverse impacts that we may sustain as a result include, without limitation, lower margins because of the need to sell our steel to less profitable customers and markets, higher fixed costs from lower steel production if we are unable to sell the same amount of steel to other customers and markets, and lower sales, shipments, pricing and margins generally as our competitors face similar challenges and compete vigorously in other markets that we serve. These adverse impacts would negatively affect our sales, financial results and cash flows. Additionally, the trend toward light weighting in the automotive industry, which requires lighter gauges of steel at higher strengths, could result in lower steel volumes required by that industry over time.\nMoreover, despite our newly acquired position as the largest flat-rolled steel producer in North America, competition for automotive business has intensified in recent years, as steel producers and companies producing alternative materials have focused their efforts on capturing and/or expanding their market share of automotive business because of less favorable conditions in other markets for steel and other metals, including commodity products and steel for use in the oil and gas markets. As a result, the potential exists that we may lose market share to existing or new entrants or that automotive manufacturers will take advantage of the intense competition among potential suppliers during annual contract renewal negotiations to pressure our pricing and margins in order to maintain or expand our market share with them, which could negatively affect our sales, financial results and cash flows.\nGlobal steelmaking overcapacity, steel imports and oversupply of iron ore could lead to lower or more volatile global steel and iron ore prices, impacting our profitability.\nSignificant global steel capacity and new or expanded production capacity in North America in recent years has caused and continues to cause capacity to exceed demand globally, as well as in our primary markets in North America. Although certain of our U.S. competitors temporarily shut down production capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic, a restart of previously idled capacity and the development of new capacity by our U.S. competitors has occurred in recent months and may occur in the future in connection with any economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, foreign competitors have substantially increased their steel production capacity in the last few years and in some instances appear to have targeted the U.S. market for imports. Also, some foreign economies, such as China, have slowed relative to recent historical norms, resulting in an increased volume of steel\nproducts that cannot be consumed by industries in those foreign steel producers\u2019 own countries. The risk of even greater levels of imports may continue, depending upon foreign market and economic conditions, changes in trade agreements and treaties, laws, regulations or government policies affecting trade, the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies and other variables beyond our control. A significant further increase in domestic steel capacity or foreign imports could adversely affect our sales, financial results and cash flows. In addition, recent increases in the market prices of iron ore products could cause new producers to enter the market or existing producers to expand productive capacity. Excess iron ore supply combined with reduced global steel demand, including in China, could lead to lower iron ore prices, which would typically contribute to lower steel prices, as iron ore is a principal steelmaking raw material. Downward pressure on iron ore and/or steel prices could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and profitability.\nSevere financial hardship or bankruptcy of one or more of our major customers or key suppliers could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance.\nSales and operations of a majority of our customers are sensitive to general economic conditions, especially, with respect to our steel customers, as they affect the North American automotive, housing, construction, appliance, energy and other industries. Some of our customers are highly leveraged. If there is a significant weakening of current economic conditions, whether because of operational, cyclical or other issues, including the COVID-19 pandemic, it could impact significantly the creditworthiness of our customers and lead to other financial difficulties or even bankruptcy filings by our customers. Failure to receive payment from our customers for products that we have delivered could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The concentration of customers in a specific industry, such as the automotive industry, may increase our risk because of the likelihood that circumstances may affect multiple customers at the same time. For example, during the first half of 2020, the automotive industry was significantly disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which concurrently adversely impacted multiple customers. Such events could cause us to experience lost sales or losses associated with the potential inability to collect all outstanding accounts receivable and reduced liquidity. Similarly, if our key suppliers face financial hardship or need to operate in bankruptcy, such suppliers could experience operational disruption or even face liquidation, which could result in our inability to secure replacement raw materials on a timely basis, or at all, or cause us to incur increased costs to do so. Such events could adversely impact our operations, financial results and cash flows.\nII. REGULATORY RISKS\nU.S. government actions on trade agreements and treaties, laws, regulations or policies affecting trade could lead to lower or more volatile global steel or iron ore prices, impacting our profitability.\nIn recent years, the U.S. government has altered its approach to international trade policy, both generally and with respect to matters directly and indirectly affecting the steel industry, including by undertaking certain unilateral actions affecting trade, renegotiating existing bilateral or multilateral trade agreements, and entering into new agreements or treaties with foreign countries. For example, in March 2018, the U.S. government issued a proclamation pursuant to Section 232 imposing a 25% tariff on imported steel that was being unfairly traded by certain foreign competitors at artificially low prices. In retaliation against the Section 232 tariffs, the European Union subsequently imposed its own tariffs against certain steel products and other goods imported from the U.S. Moreover, in light of the U.S. government leadership changes resulting from the November 2020 federal congressional and presidential elections, it is currently uncertain what changes, if any, the U.S. government may make to its recent tariff and trade policies and priorities. If, for example, the Section 232 tariffs are removed or substantially lessened, whether through legal challenge, legislation, executive action or otherwise, imports of foreign steel would likely increase and steel prices in the U.S. would likely fall, which could materially adversely affect our sales, financial results and cash flows.\nIn addition, during 2020, the USMCA was implemented among the U.S., Mexico and Canada in place of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Because all of our steel manufacturing facilities are located in North America and one of our principal markets is automotive manufacturing in North America, we believe that the USMCA has the potential to positively impact our business by incentivizing automakers and other manufacturers to increase manufacturing production in North America and to use North American steel. However, it is difficult to predict the short- and long-term implications of changes in trade policy and, therefore, whether the USMCA or other new or renegotiated trade agreements, treaties, laws, regulations or policies that may be implemented in connection with the recent U.S. government leadership changes, or otherwise, will have a beneficial or detrimental impact on our business and our customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 businesses. Adverse effects could occur directly from a disruption to trade and commercial transactions and/or indirectly by adversely affecting the U.S. economy or certain sectors of the economy, impacting demand for our customers\u2019 products and, in turn, negatively affecting demand for our products. Important\nlinks of the supply chain for some of our key customers, including automotive manufacturers, could be negatively impacted by the USMCA or other new or renegotiated trade agreements, treaties, laws, regulations or policies. Any of these actions and their direct and indirect impacts could materially adversely affect our sales, financial results and cash flows.\nAlthough we may currently benefit from certain antidumping and countervailing duty orders, any such relief is subject to periodic reviews and challenges, which can result in revocation of the orders or reduction of the duties. In addition, previously granted and future petitions for trade relief may not be successful or fully effective at preventing harm. Even if received, it is uncertain if any relief will be continued in the future or will be adequate to counteract completely the harmful effects of unfairly traded imports.\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which imposes, and will continue to impose, potential significant costs and liabilities on us. Future laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted and enforced could increase these costs and liabilities or limit our ability to produce our raw materials and products.\nNew laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations, including the response of federal, state, local and foreign governments to the COVID-19 pandemic or arising out of the changes in U.S. government leadership resulting from the November 2020 elections, or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our businesses or execute our strategies. This includes, among other things, changes in the interpretation of MSHA regulations, such as workplace exam rules or safety around mobile equipment, reevaluation of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, such as revised nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, lead, ozone and particulate matter criteria, changes in the interpretation of OSHA regulations, such as standards for occupational exposure to noise, certain chemicals or hazardous substances and infectious diseases, and the possible taxation under U.S. law of certain income from foreign operations.\nIn addition, we and our operations are subject to various international, foreign, federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and human health and safety, including those relating to air quality, water pollution, plant, wetlands, natural resources and wildlife protection (including endangered or threatened species), reclamation, remediation and restoration of properties and related surety bonds or other financial assurances, land use, the discharge of materials into the environment, the effects that industrial operations and mining have on groundwater quality, conductivity and availability, the management of electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls, and other related matters. Compliance with numerous governmental permits and approvals is required for our operations. We cannot be certain that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulations, permits and approvals. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws, regulations, permits or approvals, we could be fined, required to cease operations, subject to criminal or civil liability, or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. In particular, federal or state regulatory agencies have the authority, under certain circumstances following significant health and safety incidents, such as fatalities, to order a facility to be temporarily or permanently closed. Compliance with the complex and extensive laws and regulations to which we are subject imposes substantial costs on us, which could increase over time because of heightened regulatory oversight, adoption of more stringent environmental, health and safety standards and greater demand for remediation services leading to shortages of equipment, supplies and labor, as well as other factors.\nSpecifically, there are several notable proposed or recently enacted rulemakings or activities to which we would be subject or that would further regulate and/or tax us and our customers, which may also require us or our customers to reduce or otherwise change operations significantly or incur significant additional costs, depending on their ultimate outcome. These emerging or recently enacted rules, regulations and policy guidance include, but are not limited to: governmental regulations imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; trade regulations, such as the USMCA and/or other trade agreements, treaties or policies; tariffs, such as the 25% tariff on imported steel imposed under Section 232; Minnesota\u2019s potential revisions to the sulfate wild rice water quality standard; evolving water quality standards for selenium and conductivity; scope of the Clean Water Act and the definition of \u201cWaters of the United States\u201d; Minnesota\u2019s Mercury TMDL and associated rules governing mercury air emission reductions; Climate Change and GHG Regulation; the Regional Haze FIP Rule; and the regulation of discharges to water. In addition, the Biden Administration has indicated via executive orders and in campaign statements that it will propose more stringent environmental regulation, in particular related to climate change. Any new or more stringent legislation, regulations, rules, interpretations or orders, when enacted and enforced, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or profitability.\nOur operations may be impacted by the recent enactment, and ongoing consideration, of significant federal and state laws and regulations relating to certain mine-related issues, such as the stability of tailings basins, mine drainage and fill activities, reclamation and safety in underground mines. With respect to underground mines, for\nexample, these laws and regulations include requirements for constructing and maintaining caches for the storage of additional self-contained self-rescuers throughout underground mines; installing rescue chambers in underground mines; continuous tracking of and communication with personnel in the mines; installing cable lifelines from the mine portal to all sections of the mine to assist in emergency escape; submission and approval of emergency response plans; and additional safety training. Additionally, there are requirements for the prompt reporting of accidents and increased fines and penalties for violations of these and existing regulations. These laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial additional costs.\nAdditionally, our operations are subject to the risks of doing business abroad and we must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, which may include, but are not limited to, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws, regulations related to import/export and trade controls, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation and other U.S. and foreign privacy regulations, and transportation and logistics regulations. These laws and regulations may increase our costs of doing business in international jurisdictions and expose our operations and our employees to elevated risk. We require our employees, contractors and agents to comply with these and all other applicable laws and regulations, but failure to do so could result in possible administrative, civil or criminal liability and reputational harm to us and our employees. We may also be indirectly affected through regulatory changes that impact our customers, which in turn could reduce the quantity of our products they demand or the prices for our products they are willing to pay. Regulatory changes that impact our suppliers could decrease the supply of products or availability of services they sell to us or could increase the price they demand for products or services they sell to us.\nOur operations inadvertently may impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances, which could result in material liabilities to us.\nOur operations currently use, and have in the past used, hazardous materials, and, from time to time, we have generated solid and hazardous waste. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to claims under international, foreign, federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations for toxic torts, natural resource damages and other damages as well as for the investigation and clean-up of soil, surface water, sediments, groundwater and other natural resources and reclamation of properties. Such claims for damages and reclamation may arise out of current or former conditions at sites that we or our acquired companies currently own, lease or operate, as well as sites that we or our acquired companies formerly owned, leased or operated, and at contaminated sites that are or have been owned, leased or operated by our joint venture partners. We may also have liability for contamination at third-party sites where we have sent hazardous wastes. Our liability for these claims may be strict and/or joint and several, such that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the contamination or other damages, or even for entire claims regardless of fault. We are currently subject to potential liabilities relating to investigation and remediation activities at certain sites. In addition to sites currently owned, leased or operated, these include sites where we formerly conducted raw material processing or other operations, inactive sites that we currently own, formerly owned predecessor sites, acquired sites, leased land sites and third-party waste disposal sites. We may be named as a potentially responsible party at other sites in the future and we cannot be certain that the costs associated with these additional sites will not exceed any reserves we have established or otherwise be material.\nWe also are subject to claims asserting bodily injuries arising from alleged exposure to hazardous substances. For example, certain of our subsidiaries have been named in lawsuits claiming exposure to asbestos, many of which have been dismissed and/or settled for non-material amounts. It is likely that similar types of claims will continue to be filed in the future.\nWe may be unable to obtain, maintain, renew or comply with permits necessary for our operations or be required to provide additional financial assurances, which could reduce our production, cash flows, profitability and available liquidity.\nWe must obtain, maintain and comply with numerous permits that require approval of operational plans and impose strict conditions on various environmental, health and safety matters in connection with our steel production and processing and mining and other operations. These include permits issued by various federal, state, provincial, foreign and local agencies and regulatory bodies. The permitting rules are complex and may change over time, making our ability to comply with the applicable requirements more difficult or impractical and costly, possibly precluding the continuance of ongoing operations or the development of future operations. Interpretations of rules may also change over time and may lead to requirements, such as additional financial assurance, making it costlier to comply. For example, heightened levels of regulatory oversight with respect to our coal operations acquired as part of the AM USA Transaction could impact, delay or disrupt our ability to obtain new or renewed permits or modifications to existing permits.\nIn addition, the public, including special interest groups and individuals, have certain rights under various statutes to comment upon, submit objections to, and otherwise engage in the permitting process, including bringing citizens\u2019 lawsuits to challenge such permits or activities. Accordingly, required permits may not be issued or renewed in a timely fashion (or at all), or permits issued or renewed may include conditions that we cannot meet or otherwise be conditioned in ways that may restrict our ability to conduct our production and mining activities efficiently or include requirements for additional financial assurances that we may not be able to provide on commercially reasonable terms (or at all), which could reduce available borrowing capacity under our ABL Facility. Such conditions, restrictions or requirements could reduce our production, cash flows, profitability or liquidity.\nIII. FINANCIAL RISKS\nOur existing and future indebtedness may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our businesses, which could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our senior notes, ABL Facility and other debt, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our debt, which may not be successful.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $5,595 million aggregate principal amount of long-term debt outstanding, $2,195 million of which was secured (excluding $247 million of outstanding letters of credit and $335 million of finance leases), and $112 million of cash on our balance sheet. On December 9, 2020, in connection with the consummation of the AM USA Transaction, we amended our ABL Facility to, among other things, increase the tranche A revolver commitments available under the ABL Facility by an additional $1,500 million. After giving effect to this amendment, the aggregate principal amount of tranche A revolver commitments under our ABL Facility is $3,350 million, and the aggregate principal amount of tranche B revolver commitments under our ABL Facility remains at $150 million. As of December 31, 2020, $1,510 million was outstanding under our ABL Facility, and the principal amount of letters of credit obligations and other commitments totaled $247 million. As of December 31, 2020, the available borrowing capacity on our ABL Facility was $1,743 million.\nWe dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions or strategic development initiatives, and other general corporate purposes. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our ability to generate cash in the future and our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. There can be no assurance that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our debt. In addition, any failure to comply with covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, would have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur level of indebtedness could have further consequences, including, but not limited to, increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions, placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other businesses in the industries in which we operate that are not as leveraged and that may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns, limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate, and requiring us to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt. We may not be able to refinance on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, making it more difficult to obtain surety bonds, letters of credit or other financial assurances that may be demanded by our vendors or regulatory agencies, particularly during periods in which credit markets are weak.\nA portion of our borrowing capacity and outstanding indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the publication of LIBOR beyond 2021. The uncertainty regarding the future of LIBOR, as well as the transition from LIBOR to another benchmark rate or rates, could have adverse impacts on our outstanding debt that currently uses LIBOR as a benchmark rate and, in turn, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to service our debt obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital, including additional secured or unsecured debt, or restructure or refinance our debt, and we may be unable to continue as a going concern. We may be unable to consummate any proposed asset sales or recover the carrying value of these assets, and any proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. Any of these examples potentially could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, profitability, shareholders\u2019 equity and capital structure.\nChanges in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and the market price of our securities.\nCredit rating agencies could downgrade our ratings due to various developments, including matters arising out of the AK Steel Merger or the AM USA Transaction, incurring additional indebtedness and other factors specific to our businesses, a prolonged cyclical downturn in the steel and mining industries, whether due to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, or macroeconomic trends (such as global or regional recessions), and trends in credit and capital markets more generally. Any decline in our credit ratings may result in an increase to our cost of future financing or limit our access to the capital markets, which could harm our financial condition, hinder our ability to refinance existing indebtedness on acceptable terms, or have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities and the terms under which we purchase goods and services.\nOur actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.\nFrom time to time, we release guidance, including that set forth under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Outlook\u201d in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, regarding our future performance. This guidance, which consists of forward-looking statements, is prepared by our management and is qualified by, and subject to, the assumptions and the other information included in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent or outside party compiles or examines the guidance and, accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.\nGuidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. The principal reason that we release such data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such third parties.\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results will vary from the guidance. Investors should also recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data diminishes the further in the future that the data are forecast. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it.\nAny failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the risks described in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K or our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q could result in actual operating results being different than the guidance, and such differences may be adverse and material.\nOur assets as of December 31, 2020 include a deferred tax asset, the full value of which we may not be able to realize.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2020, the net deferred tax asset was $492 million, primarily related to U.S. NOLs. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability based on our history of earnings, expectations for future earnings and expected timing of reversals of temporary differences. Realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income. We believe the recorded net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2020, is fully realizable based on our expected future earnings. However, our assumptions and estimates are inherently subject to business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and some of which may change. As a result, we could ultimately lose a portion of our deferred tax asset related to NOLs due to expiration, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe ability to use our NOLs and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIf a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the IRC, the corporation\u2019s NOLs and certain other tax attributes arising before the \u201cownership change\u201d are subject to limitations after the \u201cownership change.\u201d An \u201cownership change\u201d under Section 382 of the IRC generally occurs if one or more\nshareholders or groups of shareholders who own at least 5% of the corporation\u2019s equity increase their ownership in the aggregate by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling period that begins on the later of three years prior to the testing date and the date of the last \u201cownership change.\u201d If an \u201cownership change\u201d were to occur, Section 382 of the IRC would impose an annual limit on the amount of pre-ownership change NOLs and other tax attributes the corporation could use to reduce its taxable income, potentially increasing and accelerating the corporation\u2019s liability for income taxes, and also potentially causing tax attributes to expire unused. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on a corporation\u2019s value immediately prior to the ownership change.\nAs of December 31, 2020, after taking into account limitations (or disallowance) on use, we had $2,510 million and $1,009 million of available U.S. federal and state NOLs, respectively, including amounts acquired in the AK Steel Merger. The use of our common shares in the Acquisitions in conjunction with subsequent issuances or sales of our shares (including transactions that are outside of our control) could cause us to experience an \u201cownership change.\u201d If we experience an \u201cownership change\u201d under Section 382 of the IRC, further limitations (or disallowances) may apply and similar rules may also apply under state and foreign laws. Consequently, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our NOLs and other tax attributes, which, in addition to increasing our U.S. federal and state income tax liability, could adversely affect our share price, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nHolders of our common shares may not receive dividends on their common shares.\nWe are not required to declare cash dividends on our common shares and, in April 2020, we announced the suspension of future dividends. Holders of our common shares are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board may from time to time declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Ohio and governed by the Ohio General Corporation Law, which allows a corporation to pay dividends, in general, in an amount that cannot exceed its surplus, as determined under Ohio law. Our ability to pay dividends will be subject to our future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition, as well as our compliance with covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future indebtedness, business prospects and other factors that our Board may deem relevant. Additionally, our ABL Facility contains, and agreements governing any of our future debt may contain, covenants and other restrictions that, in certain circumstances, could limit the level of dividends that we are able to pay on our common shares.\nIV. OPERATIONAL RISKS\nWe face significant risks relating to our recent acquisitions of the AK Steel and ArcelorMittal USA businesses.\nDuring 2020, we completed both the AK Steel Merger and the AM USA Transaction. These recent transformative acquisitions involve a number of significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect us, including the following:\n\u2022inability to realize anticipated synergies or other expected benefits or cost savings;\n\u2022additional debt incurred or assumed in connection with the acquisitions could limit our financial flexibility, including our ability to acquire additional assets and make further strategic investments in the future;\n\u2022diversion of financial resources to the new operations or acquired businesses;\n\u2022assumption of substantial additional environmental exposures, commitments, contingencies and remediation and reclamation projects;\n\u2022liabilities for acquired pension and OPEB obligations, which could require us to make significant cash expenditures and funding contributions in excess of current estimates and contribution rates;\n\u2022impairment of recorded tangible and intangible asset values, including goodwill, could result in material non-cash charges to our results of operations in the future;\n\u2022failure to successfully integrate acquired systems, business processes, policies and procedures;\n\u2022exposure to unknown liabilities and unforeseen costs that were not discovered during due diligence;\n\u2022loss of human capital resources and support services historically provided by ArcelorMittal and potential failure of ArcelorMittal or its affiliates to perform under various contracts entered into in connection with the AM USA Transaction, including the intellectual property license agreement, slab supply agreement and\ntransition services agreement, which could adversely impact our integration of the ArcelorMittal USA operations;\n\u2022potential loss of key employees, suppliers or customers; and\n\u2022other challenges associated with managing the larger, more complex and integrated combined businesses.\nIf one or more of these risks and uncertainties were to materialize, we could experience reduced sales, higher costs, lower profitability and other adverse impacts to our operations and businesses.\nIn addition, in connection with the closing of the AM USA Transaction, we issued approximately 78 million of our common shares to an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of ArcelorMittal, equating to approximately 16% of our then-outstanding common shares. On February 11, 2021, in connection with our sale of 20 million of our common shares in an underwritten public offering, such subsidiary of ArcelorMittal, as a selling shareholder in the offering, sold 40 million of our common shares. We believe such subsidiary of ArcelorMittal continues to hold approximately 38 million of our common shares, equating to approximately 8% of our outstanding common shares following completion of such offering. Although ArcelorMittal and its affiliates are subject to certain restrictions and requirements under an Investor Rights Agreement with respect to its and its affiliates' ownership and voting of our common shares, at such a level of beneficial ownership, ArcelorMittal and its affiliates may be able to exert influence over us and actions requiring the approval of our common shareholders. Under the Investor Rights Agreement, ArcelorMittal and its affiliates are permitted to transfer all of our common shares held by them, subject to certain restrictions on transfers to persons whose beneficial ownership of our common shares following any such transfer would exceed 5% or 10% of our then-outstanding common shares. Sales of our shares by ArcelorMittal and its affiliates or other shareholders, coupled with the increase in the outstanding number of our common shares, may affect the market for, and the market price of, our common shares in an adverse manner.\nWe also issued 583,273 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of ArcelorMittal in connection with the closing of the AM USA Transaction. Pursuant to the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock, from and after the 24-month anniversary of the issue date of the Series B Preferred Stock (the \u201c24-Month Anniversary\u201d), each holder of a share of Series B Preferred Stock is entitled to receive cash dividends (the \u201cAdditional Dividends\u201d) that will accrue and compound at a significant rate. Although the Series B Preferred Stock is redeemable at our option 180 days after the issue date, the agreements governing our debt may restrict us from paying the redemption price at any given time. If we are unable to redeem the Series B Preferred Stock prior to the 24-Month Anniversary and we become obligated to pay the Additional Dividends, we may be required to divert financial resources from our operations or borrow additional debt in order to satisfy such obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have limited ability to control our joint venture operations, rely on our joint venture partners to meet their payment obligations, and are subject to risks involving the acts or omissions of our joint venture partners.\nAs part of the AM USA Transaction, we acquired ArcelorMittal USA\u2019s interest in Hibbing and again became the manager of Hibbing, which we co-own with U.S. Steel. In our steel business, we are party to various joint venture arrangements primarily related to downstream steel processing operations. Due to shared ownership, we have limited ability to control our joint venture operations, and we cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners. Accordingly, we rely on our joint venture partners to make their required capital contributions and to pay for their share of joint venture obligations. If our joint venture partners experience financial hardship or fail to perform their obligations, we may be required to assume additional material obligations to minimize operational disruption or as part of a liquidation, including significant capital contributions, costs of environmental remediation, and pension and OPEB obligations.\nOur operating expenses could increase significantly if the price of raw materials, electrical power, fuel or other energy sources increases.\nOur operations require significant use of energy and raw materials. Energy expenses are sensitive to changes in electricity, energy transportation and fuel prices, including diesel fuel and natural gas. Although we are self-sufficient in iron ore, other raw materials or production inputs where we are wholly or partially dependent on third-party suppliers include industrial gases, graphite electrodes, scrap, chrome, zinc, coke and coal. Prices for electricity, natural gas, fuel oils and raw materials can fluctuate widely with availability and demand levels from other users, including fluctuations caused by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. During periods of peak usage, although some operations have contractual arrangements in place whereby they receive certain offsetting payments in exchange for electricity load reduction, supplies of energy and raw materials in general may be curtailed and we may not be able to purchase them at historical rates. A disruption in the transmission of energy, inadequate energy transmission\ninfrastructure, or the termination of any of our energy supply contracts could interrupt our energy supply and adversely affect our operations. While we have some long-term contracts with electrical, natural gas and raw material suppliers, we are exposed to fluctuations in energy, natural gas and raw material costs that can affect our production costs. As an example, our Toledo direct reduction plant is subject to changes in the market price of natural gas, which is a key input in the direct reduction of iron ore pellets to produce HBI. We enter into many market-based pricing supply contracts for electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel for use in our operations. Those contracts expose us to price increases in energy costs, which could cause our profitability to decrease significantly. In addition, U.S. public utilities may impose rate increases and pass through additional capital and operating cost increases to their customers related to new or pending U.S. environmental regulations or other charges that may require significant capital investment and use of cleaner fuels in the future. In particular, the recent decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia vacating and remanding the Affordable Clean Energy Rule, as well as recent executive orders from President Biden regarding the environment and climate change, indicate that new or revised regulations under the Biden Administration could result in rate increases from U.S. utilities.\nThe majority of our steel shipments are sold under contracts that do not allow us to pass through all increases in raw materials, supplies and energy costs. Some of our steel shipments to contract customers include variable-pricing mechanisms allowing us to adjust the total sales price based on changes in specified raw materials, supplies and energy costs. Those adjustments, however, rarely reflect all of our underlying raw materials, supplies and energy cost changes. The scope of the adjustment may also be limited by the terms of the negotiated language, including limitations on when the adjustment occurs. Our need to consume existing inventories may also delay the impact of a change in prices of raw materials or supplies. Significant changes in raw material costs may also increase the potential for inventory value write-downs in the event of a reduction in selling prices and our inability to realize the cost of the inventory.\nSteelmaking facility or mine closures entail substantial costs. If our assumptions underlying our accruals for closure costs prove to be inaccurate or we prematurely close one or more of our facilities or mines, our results of operations and financial condition would likely be adversely affected.\nIf faced with overcapacity in the market or other adverse conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may seek to rationalize assets through asset sales, temporary shutdowns, indefinite idles or facility closures. If we indefinitely idle or permanently close any of our facilities or mines, our production and revenues would be reduced unless we were able to increase production at our other facilities or mines in an offsetting amount, which may not be possible, and could result in customers responding negatively by taking current or future business away from us if we seek to transition production to a different facility. Alternatively, we could fail to meet customer specifications at the facilities to which products are transitioned, resulting in customer dissatisfaction or claims.\nThe closure of a steelmaking facility or mining operation involves significant closure costs, including reclamation and other environmental costs, the costs of terminating long-term obligations, including customer, energy and transportation contracts and equipment leases, and certain accounting charges, including asset impairment and accelerated depreciation. In addition, a permanent steelmaking facility or mine closure could accelerate and significantly increase employment legacy costs, including our expense and funding costs for pension and OPEB obligations and multiemployer pension withdrawal liabilities. A number of employees would be eligible for immediate retirement under special eligibility rules that apply upon a steelmaking facility or mine closure. All employees eligible for immediate retirement under the pension plans at the time of the permanent closure also could be eligible for OPEB, thereby accelerating our obligation to provide these benefits. Certain closures would precipitate a pension closure liability significantly greater than an ongoing operation liability and may trigger certain severance liability obligations.\nWe base our assumptions regarding the life of our mines on detailed studies we perform from time to time, but those studies and assumptions are subject to uncertainties and estimates that may not be accurate. We recognize the costs of reclaiming open pits, stockpiles, tailings ponds, roads and other mining support areas based on the estimated mining life of our property. If our assumptions underlying our accruals for closure costs, including reclamation and other environmental costs, prove to be inaccurate or insufficient, or our liability in any particular year is greater than currently anticipated, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, if we were to significantly reduce the estimated life of any of our mines, the mine closure costs would be applied to a shorter period of production, which would increase costs per ton produced and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur sales and competitive position depend on the ability to transport our products to our customers at competitive rates and in a timely manner.\nDisruption of the lake, rail and/or trucking transportation services because of weather-related problems, including ice and winter weather conditions on the Great Lakes or St. Lawrence Seaway, climate change, strikes, lock-outs, driver shortages and other disruptions in the trucking industry, rail network constraints, global or domestic pandemics or epidemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other infectious disease outbreaks, in each case causing a business disruption, or other events and lack of alternative transportation options could impair our ability to move products internally among our facilities and to supply products to our customers at competitive rates or in a timely manner and, thus, could adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. Further, dredging issues and environmental changes, particularly at Great Lakes ports, could impact adversely our ability to move certain of our products or result in higher freight rates. Similarly, we depend on third-party transportation services for delivery of raw materials to us, and failures or delays in delivery would have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain steady-state production operations to meet customer obligations.\nNatural or human-caused disasters, weather conditions, disruption of energy, unanticipated geological conditions, equipment failures, infectious disease outbreaks, and other unexpected events may lead our customers, our suppliers or our facilities to curtail production or shut down operations.\nOperating levels within our industry and the industries of our customers and suppliers are subject to unexpected conditions and events that are beyond the industries\u2019 control. Those events, including the occurrence of an infectious disease or illness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could cause industry members or their suppliers to curtail production or shut down a portion or all of their operations, which could reduce the demand for our products and adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. For example, the temporary production shutdowns in the automotive industry during 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated reduction in demand for our products led to our decision to temporarily idle certain steelmaking facilities and iron ore mines.\nOur operating levels are subject to conditions beyond our control that can delay deliveries or increase the cost of production for varying lengths of time. Factors that could cause production disruptions could include adverse weather conditions (for example, extreme winter weather, tornadoes, floods, and the lack of availability of process water due to drought) and natural and man-made disasters, lack of adequate raw materials, energy or other supplies, and infectious disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, factors that could adversely impact production and operations at our mining operations include tailings dam failures, pit wall failures, unanticipated geological conditions, including variations in the amount of rock and soil overlying deposits of iron ore and coal, variations in rock and other natural materials, and variations in geologic conditions and processing changes.\nOur mining operations, processing facilities, steelmaking and logistics operations depend on critical pieces of equipment. This equipment may, on occasion, be out of service because of unanticipated failures or unplanned outages. In addition, most of our mines and production and processing facilities have been in operation for several decades, and the equipment is aged. In the future, we may experience additional lengthy shutdowns or periods of reduced production because of equipment failures. Further, remediation of any interruption in production capability may require us to make large capital expenditures that could have a negative impact on our profitability and cash flows. Our business interruption insurance would not cover all of the lost revenues associated with equipment failures. Longer-term business disruptions could result in a loss of customers, which could adversely affect our future sales levels and revenues.\nMany of our production facilities and mines are dependent on one source for electric power, natural gas, industrial gases and/or certain other raw materials or supplies. A significant interruption in service from our suppliers due to the COVID-19 pandemic, terrorism or sabotage, weather conditions, natural disasters, equipment failure or any other cause could result in substantial losses that may not be fully recoverable, either from our business interruption insurance or responsible third parties.\nWe incur certain costs when production capacity is idled, as well as increased costs to resume production at previously idled facilities.\nOur decisions concerning which facilities to operate and at what production levels are made based in part upon our customers\u2019 orders for products, as well as the quality, performance capabilities and cost of our operations. During depressed market conditions, we may concentrate production at certain facilities and not operate others in response to customer demand, and as a result we may incur idle costs that could offset our anticipated savings from not operating the idled facility. For example, due to reduced demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of our steelmaking facilities and iron ore mines were temporarily idled during portions of 2020 and we continued to incur\ncertain fixed costs at those facilities. We cannot predict whether our operations will experience additional disruptions in the future.\nWhen we restart idled facilities, we incur certain costs to replenish inventories, prepare the previously idled facilities for operation, perform the required repair and maintenance activities, and prepare employees to return to work safely and resume production responsibilities. The amount of any such costs can be material, depending on a variety of factors, such as the period of idle time, necessary repairs and available employees, and is difficult to project.\nWe may not have adequate insurance coverage for some business risks.\nOur operations are generally subject to a number of hazards and risks, which could result in personal injury or damage to, or destruction of, equipment, properties or facilities. The insurance that we maintain to address risks that are typical in our businesses may not provide adequate coverage. Insurance against some risks, such as liabilities for environmental pollution, tailings basin breaches, or certain hazards or interruption of certain business activities, may not be available at an economically reasonable cost, or at all. Even if available, we may self-insure where we determine it is most cost effective to do so. As a result, despite the insurance coverage that we carry, accidents or other negative developments involving our production, mining, processing or transportation activities causing losses in excess of policy limits, or losses arising from events not covered under insurance policies, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows.\nA disruption in or failure of our IT systems, including those related to cybersecurity, could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance.\nWe rely on the accuracy, capacity, integrity and security of our IT systems for the operation of many of our business processes and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. While we maintain some of our critical IT systems, we are also dependent on third parties to provide important IT services relating to, among other things, operational process technology at our facilities, human resources, electronic communications and certain finance functions. Further, in connection with the Acquisitions, we inherited certain legacy hardware and software IT systems that can be supported only by a very limited number of specialists in the market, and our increased reliance on these legacy IT systems may increase the risk of IT system disruption or failure, which could adversely affect our operations.\nDespite the security measures that we have implemented, including those related to cybersecurity, our IT systems could be breached or damaged by computer viruses, natural or man-made incidents or disasters, or unauthorized physical or electronic access or intrusions. Though we have controls in place, we cannot provide assurance that a cyberattack will not occur. Furthermore, we may have little or no oversight with respect to security measures employed by third-party service providers, which may ultimately prove to be ineffective at countering threats. We may also experience increased risk of IT system failures or cyberattacks as many of our employees continue to work from home as part of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we may experience increased risk of IT system failures or cyberattacks as transitional activities relating to the Acquisitions are in progress, since these activities expose each company to the other\u2019s security vulnerabilities, and because the Acquisitions may attract the attention of potential cyber criminals.\nFailures of our IT systems, whether caused maliciously or inadvertently, may result in the disruption of our business processes, or in the unauthorized release of sensitive, confidential, personally identifiable or otherwise protected information, or result in the corruption of data, each of which could adversely affect our businesses. For example, cybersecurity vulnerabilities could result in an interruption of the functionality of our automated manufacturing operating systems, which, if compromised, could cease, threaten, delay or slow down our ability to produce or process steel or any of our other products for the duration of such interruption, which could result in reputational harm and may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, any compromise of the security of our IT systems could result in a loss of confidence in our security measures and subject us to litigation, regulatory investigations and negative publicity that could adversely affect our reputation and financial condition. Our customers, suppliers and vendors may also access or store certain of our sensitive information on their IT systems, which, if breached, attacked or accessed by unauthorized persons, could likewise expose our sensitive information and adversely impact our businesses. Furthermore, as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, we may be required to incur significant costs and invest additional resources to protect against and, if required, remediate the damage caused by such disruptions or system failures in the future.\nV. DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY RISKS\nThe cost and time to implement a strategic capital project may prove to be greater than originally anticipated.\nFrom time to time, we undertake strategic capital projects, such as our recently-completed Toledo direct reduction plant, in order to enhance, expand or upgrade our production and mining capabilities or diversify our customer base. Our ability to achieve the anticipated production volumes, revenues or otherwise realize acceptable returns on strategic capital projects that we may undertake is subject to a number of risks, many of which are beyond our control, including a variety of market (such as a volatile pricing environment for our products), operational, permitting and labor-related factors. Further, the cost to implement any given strategic capital project ultimately may prove to be greater and may take more time than originally anticipated. Inability to achieve the anticipated results from the implementation of our strategic capital projects, incurring unanticipated implementation costs or penalties, or the inability to meet contractual obligations could adversely affect our results of operations and future earnings and cash flow generation.\nWe must continually replace reserves depleted by production. Exploration activities may not result in additional discoveries.\nOur ability to replenish mineral reserves is important to our long-term viability. Depleted reserves must be replaced by further delineation of existing mineral bodies or by locating new deposits in order to maintain production levels over the long term. Decisions to defer mine development activities may adversely impact our ability to substantially increase future mineral production. Resource exploration and development are highly speculative in nature. Exploration projects involve many risks, require substantial expenditures and may not result in the discovery of sufficient additional mineral deposits that can be mined economically. Once a mineral body is discovered, it may take several years from the initial phases of drilling until production is possible, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change. Substantial expenditures are required to establish recoverable proven and probable reserves and to construct mining and processing facilities. As a result, there is no assurance that current or future exploration programs will be successful, and there is a risk that depletion of reserves will not be offset by discoveries or acquisitions.\nWe rely on estimates of our recoverable reserves, which is complex due to geological characteristics of the properties and the number of assumptions made.\nWe regularly evaluate our iron ore and coal reserves based on revenues and costs and update them as required in accordance with SEC regulations. We anticipate further updating our mining properties disclosure in accordance with the SEC\u2019s Final Rule 13-10570, Modernization of Property Disclosures for Mining Registrants, which became effective February 25, 2019, and which rescinds SEC Industry Guide 7 following a two-year transition period, which means that we will be required to comply with the new rule no later than our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2021.\nEstimates of reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, some of which are beyond our control, such as production capacity, effects of regulations by governmental agencies, future prices for iron ore and coal, future industry conditions and operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs, and costs of extraction and reclamation. Estimating the quantity and grade of reserves requires us to determine the size, shape and depth of our mineral bodies by analyzing geological data, such as samplings of drill holes. Estimated reserves could be affected by future industry conditions, future changes in the SEC\u2019s mining property disclosure requirements, geological conditions and ongoing mine planning. Actual volume and grade of reserves recovered, production rates, revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates, and if such variances are material, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected.\nDefects in title or loss of any leasehold interests in our mining properties could limit our ability to mine these properties or result in significant unanticipated costs.\nMany of our operations are conducted on properties we lease, license or as to which we have easements or other possessory interests. We generally do not maintain title insurance on our properties. A title defect or the loss of any lease, license, easement or other possessory interest for any mining property could adversely affect our ability to mine any associated reserves. In addition, from time to time the rights of third parties for competing uses of adjacent, overlying or underlying lands, such as for roads, easements, public facilities or other mining activities, may affect our ability to operate as planned if our title is not superior or mutually acceptable arrangements cannot be negotiated. Any challenge to our title could delay the exploration and development of some reserves, deposits or surface rights, cause us to incur unanticipated costs, and could ultimately result in the loss of some or all of our interest in those properties.\nIn the event we lose reserves, deposits or surface rights, we may be required to shut down or significantly alter impacted mining operations, thereby affecting future production, revenues and cash flows.\nIn order to continue to foster growth in our businesses and maintain stability of our earnings, we must maintain our social license to operate with our stakeholders.\nMaintaining a strong reputation and consistent operational, environmental and safety track record is vital in order to continue to foster growth and maintain stability in our earnings. As stakeholders\u2019 sustainability expectations increase and regulatory requirements continue to evolve, maintaining our social license to operate becomes increasingly important. Our ability to maintain our reputation and strong operating track record could be threatened, including by challenges relating to the integration of the AK Steel and ArcelorMittal USA businesses or by circumstances outside of our control, such as disasters caused or suffered by other companies in the steel and mining industries. If we are not able to respond effectively to these and other challenges to our social license to operate, our reputation could be damaged significantly. Damage to our reputation could adversely affect our operations and ability to foster growth projects.\nVI. HUMAN CAPITAL RISKS\nOur profitability could be adversely affected if we fail to maintain satisfactory labor relations.\nOur production is dependent upon the efforts of our employees. We are party to labor agreements with various labor unions that represent employees at the majority of our operations. Such labor agreements are negotiated periodically, and, therefore, we are subject to the risk that these agreements may not be able to be renewed on reasonably satisfactory terms. It is difficult to predict what issues may arise as part of the collective bargaining process, and whether negotiations concerning these issues will be successful. Due to union activities or other employee actions, we could experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in our production that could affect us adversely. We have labor agreements that will expire at five locations in 2021 and sixteen locations in 2022. If we enter into a new labor agreement with any union that significantly increases our labor costs relative to our competitors or fail to come to an agreement upon expiry, our ability to compete or continuity of production may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may encounter labor shortages for critical operational positions, which could adversely affect our ability to produce our products.\nWe are predicting a long-term shortage of skilled workers in heavy industry and in certain highly specialized IT roles, and competition for the available workers limits our ability to attract and retain employees as well as engage third-party contractors. As our experienced employees retire, we may have difficulty replacing them at competitive wages. In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted and may continue to result in increased government restrictions and regulation, including quarantines of our personnel and potential inability to access facilities, which has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our operations.\nOur expenditures for pension and OPEB obligations could be materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying assumptions differ from actual outcomes, there are regulatory changes or our joint venture partners fail to perform their obligations that relate to employee pension plans.\nWe provide defined benefit pension plans and OPEB to certain eligible union and non-union employees, including our share of expense and funding obligations with respect to our unconsolidated joint ventures. Our pension and OPEB expenses and our required contributions to our pension and OPEB plans are affected directly by the value of plan assets, the projected and actual rate of return on plan assets, and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the rate at which future obligations are discounted. We cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will increase our pension and OPEB expenses or our funding obligations, diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses.\nWe have calculated our unfunded pension and OPEB obligations based on a number of assumptions. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially higher. Moreover, we cannot be certain that regulatory changes will not increase our obligations to provide these or additional benefits. These obligations also may increase substantially in the event of adverse medical cost trends or unexpected rates of early retirement, particularly for bargaining unit retirees. In addition, changes in the laws governing pensions could also materially adversely affect our costs and ability to meet our pension obligations.\nWe also contribute to certain multiemployer pension plans, including the Steelworkers\u2019 Pension Trust, for which we are one of the largest contributing employers. If other contributors were to default on their obligations to contribute to any such plans, we could become liable for additional unfunded contributions to the plans.\nIn addition, some of the transactions in which we previously sold or otherwise disposed of our non-core assets included provisions transferring certain pension and other liabilities to the purchasers or acquirers of those assets. While we believe that all such transfers were completed properly and are legally binding, if the purchaser fails to fulfill its obligations, we may be at risk that a court, arbitrator or regulatory body could disagree and determine that we remain responsible for pension and other liabilities that we intended to and did transfer.\nWe depend on our senior management team and other key employees, and the loss of these employees could adversely affect our businesses.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract, retain, develop and motivate our senior management and key employees. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to a variety of factors, including fluctuations in the global economic and industry conditions, competitors\u2019 hiring practices, cost reduction activities, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. Competition for qualified personnel can be intense. We must continue to recruit, retain, develop and motivate our senior management and key personnel in order to maintain our business and support our projects. A loss of senior management and key personnel could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities, and our operating results could be adversely affected. We are also subject to the risk that the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the health or effectiveness of members of our senior management team or other key employees.", "PERMNO": 27422, "SIC": 1000, "TIC": "CLF"}
