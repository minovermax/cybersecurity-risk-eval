{"cik": "1680379", "company": "Sterling Bancorp, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe face a number of significant risks and uncertainties in connection with our operations. Our business and the results of our operations could be materially adversely affected by the factors described below. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our operations. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Advantage Loan Program\nThe Internal Review results indicate numerous instances of misconduct by employees in connection with the origination of residential real estate loans in our Advantage Loan Program.\nThe primary focus of the Internal Review has involved the origination of residential real estate loans under the Advantage Loan Program and related matters. The Internal Review has indicated that certain employees engaged in misconduct in connection with the origination of a significant number of such loans, including with respect to verification of income, the amount of income reported for borrowers, reliance on third parties, and related documentation. As a result, the Company permanently discontinued the Advantage Loan Program, and a significant number of officers and employees have been terminated or resigned, including the top loan producers within the Advantage Loan Program. These terminations and resignations, and the discontinuation of the Advantage Loan Program, have materially and adversely affected our loan production and may continue to do so. In addition, if we are unable to replace terminated and departed loan producers\u2019 production through other loan officers and loan products, hire new producers or implement new loan products, our results of operation will be materially and adversely affected.\nWhile the Internal Review is substantially complete, the Company expects it to remain open during the pendency of the government investigations discussed below, and it is possible additional work will be required in connection with the Internal Review. If further work is required in connection with the Internal Review, management\u2019s time and resources could be diverted, and we may incur significant legal and other expenses in connection with such additional work.\nThe misconduct of employees discovered during the Internal Review has resulted in a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations through significant expenditures on third parties and the expenditure of significant internal resources for the conduct of the Internal Review, damage to our reputation, termination of a core part of our operating model and a number of additional material risks identified in the Risk Factors set forth below.\nPending government investigations may result in adverse findings, reputational damage, the imposition of sanctions and other negative consequences that could adversely affect our financial condition and future operating results.\nThe Bank is currently under formal investigation by the OCC relating primarily to certain aspects of its BSA/AML compliance program as well as the Bank\u2019s credit administration, including its Advantage Loan Program. The Bank also has received grand jury subpoenas from the DOJ beginning in 2020 requesting the production of documents and information in connection with an investigation that is focused on the Bank\u2019s Advantage Loan Program and related issues, including residential lending practices and public disclosures about that program contained in the Company\u2019s filings with the SEC. During 2021, the DOJ charged by criminal information the former managing director of residential lending and senior loan officer of the Bank and two other former loan officers with conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud in connection with the Advantage Loan Program, and each individual has pled guilty to that charge. The criminal information and plea agreement with respect to the former managing director of residential lending asserts that the individual acted with the knowledge and encouragement of certain former members of senior management. In addition, the Company is responding to a formal investigation initiated by the SEC in the first quarter of 2021. This investigation appears to be focused on accounting, financial reporting and disclosure matters, as well as the Company\u2019s internal controls, related to the Advantage Loan Program. The Bank and the Company are fully cooperating with these government investigations. The outcome of the pending government investigations is uncertain. There can be no assurance (i) that we will not incur material losses due to damages, penalties, costs and/or expenses imposed on the Company as a result of such investigations, (ii) that the liability we have established will be sufficient to cover such losses or (iii) that such losses will not materially exceed such liabilities and have a material adverse effect on our future operations, financial condition, growth or results of operations or other aspects of our business. Adverse findings in any of these investigations could also result in additional regulatory scrutiny, constraints on the Bank\u2019s business or other formal enforcement action. Such adverse findings could also have collateral consequences for the Company and the Bank, such as creating breaches of representation in certain third party agreements and loss of eligibility to participate in certain government programs and programs of government sponsored entities. Any of those events could have a material adverse effect on our future operations, financial condition, growth or other aspects of our business. In addition, management\u2019s time and resources have been and will continue to be diverted to address the investigations and any related litigation, and we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant legal and other costs and expenses in our defense of the investigations.\nThe permanent discontinuation of our Advantage Loan Program has materially and adversely affected our results of operations and will continue to do so.\nOn December 9, 2019, we voluntarily suspended our Advantage Loan Program in connection with the Internal Review, and we subsequently determined to permanently discontinue the Advantage Loan Program. While the Company will continue to work on initiatives to diversify its overall loan production and to review new residential loan products, the implementation of any new loan products takes time and may be subject to the prior review and approval of applicable bank regulatory authorities. We therefore have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, adverse effects on our residential loan production as a result of the permanent discontinuation of the Advantage Loan Program. In addition, repayments from our loan portfolio will need to continue to be invested in lower yielding assets until new loan programs can commence. Accordingly, we expect that the permanent discontinuation of the Advantage Loan Program will continue to materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nFailure to comply with the OCC Agreement regarding our BSA/AML compliance program and credit administration, or with BSA/AML laws and regulations generally, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe Bank continues to be subject to the OCC Agreement, which relates primarily to certain aspects of the Bank\u2019s BSA/AML compliance program as well as its credit administration. The BSA, the USA PATRIOT ACT and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective AML program and to file timely reports such as suspicious activity reports and currency transaction reports.\nThe OCC Agreement generally requires that the Bank enhance its policies and procedures to ensure compliance with BSA/AML laws and regulations and ensure effective controls over residential loan underwriting. Specifically, the OCC Agreement requires the Bank to: (i) establish a compliance committee to monitor and oversee the Bank\u2019s compliance with the provisions of the OCC Agreement; (ii) develop a revised customer due diligence and enhanced due diligence program; (iii) develop a revised suspicious activity monitoring program; (iv) engage an independent, third-party consultant to review and provide a written report on the Bank\u2019s suspicious activity monitoring; (v) develop revised policies and procedures to ensure effective BSA/AML model risk management for the Bank\u2019s automated suspicious activity monitoring system, which must be validated by a qualified, independent third party; (vi) ensure that the Bank\u2019s BSA Department maintains sufficient personnel; and (vii) develop revised policies and procedures to ensure effective controls over loan underwriting. In addition to these requirements, while the OCC Agreement remains in effect, the Bank is subject to certain restrictions on expansion activities, such as growth through acquisition or branching to supplement organic growth of the Bank.\nFailure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. Further, any failure to comply with the requirements of the OCC Agreement , or a finding by the OCC that the Bank has failed to comply, could result in additional regulatory scrutiny, further enforcement actions, the imposition of material restrictions on the activities of the Bank or the assessment of fines or penalties. Also, due to the existence of the OCC Agreement, some counterparties may not be permitted to, due to their internal policies, or may choose not to, do business with the Bank. Should counterparties upon which the Bank relies for the conduct of its business become unwilling to do business with the Bank, the Bank\u2019s results of operations and/or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. There is no assurance as to how long the OCC Agreement will remain in effect.\nThe Bank has incurred significant costs in its efforts to comply with the OCC Agreement and its BSA/AML compliance obligations. Additional expenses and investments have been incurred as the Bank has expanded its hiring of personnel and use of outside professionals, such as consulting and legal services, and capital investments in operating systems to comply with the OCC Agreement and to strengthen and support the BSA/AML compliance program, as well as the Bank\u2019s broader compliance and risk management infrastructures. The costs, expenses and capital investments associated with all of these efforts, including in connection with the OCC Agreement, have had an adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s results of operations and is expected to continue to have a material adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Internal Review has revealed instances of the Bank\u2019s failure to comply with federal regulations governing the origination of residential real estate loans, including rules governing the verification of a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan.\nAmong the many federal regulations with which we must comply in connection with the origination of residential real estate loans are rules issued by the CFPB that require, for loans within its scope, that a mortgage lender must make a reasonable and good faith determination at or before consummation that the consumer will have a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms. Among other requirements, a creditor must verify the information on which it bases its repayment ability determination by using reasonably reliable, written third-party records. The rule also provides that loans that meet a QM definition will be presumed to have complied with the ATR standard. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Supervision and Regulation-Federal Banking Regulation-ATR/QM Rules\u201d for additional details regarding these ATR/QM rules and their effects on our business, as well as recent, related regulatory developments.\nOur residential real estate loans originated under our former Advantage Loan Program are not QMs, as our underwriting processes for this program did not follow applicable regulatory guidance required for such qualification. The Internal Review has identified numerous instances of noncompliance with the income verification requirements under the ATR/QM rules. We could be subject to statutory claims for violations of the ATR standard, as well as other laws and regulations governing the origination of residential real estate loans. Any such claims could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may incur future losses in connection with certain representations and warranties we have made with respect to residential mortgages originated under our Advantage Loan Program, as well as other residential mortgages, that we have sold into the secondary market.\nFrom time to time, we package residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market while retaining the servicing rights with respect to such loans. In connection with such sales, we make representations and warranties, which, if breached, may require us to repurchase such loans, substitute other loans or indemnify the purchasers of such loans for actual losses incurred in respect of such loans. To avoid the uncertainty of audits and inquiries by third-party investors in Advantage Loan Program loans sold to the secondary market, beginning at the end of the second quarter of 2020, we commenced making offers to each of those investors to repurchase 100% of our previously sold Advantage Loan Program loans. A substantial portion of these loans were sold to the secondary market at a slight premium to their principal balances, and, as a result, we are required to repurchase such loans at that same premium. In the past two years, we have successfully repurchased Advantage Loan Program loans with an aggregate principal balance of $243.5 million, at an aggregate loss of $6.2 million, which has been recorded against the mortgage repurchase liability. We currently have outstanding commitments to repurchase Advantage Loan Program loans with an aggregate principal balance of $73.0 million as of December 31, 2021 over the next 18 months. We anticipate these repurchases, if completed, will also be at a loss and there can be no assurance as to the extent of any further repurchases we may complete as a result of our repurchase offers or that the liability we have previously established with respect to such repurchase risk will be sufficient to cover potential losses we may incur in connection with such repurchases. Accordingly, it is possible that additional requests to repurchase loans could occur in the future, and such requests may have a negative financial impact on us.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe economic disruptions created by the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our business and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to create extensive disruptions to U.S. and global economic conditions and financial markets and to businesses and the lives of individuals throughout the world. Federal and state governments have taken unprecedented actions to contain the spread of the disease, including quarantines, travel bans, shelter-in-place orders, closures of businesses and schools, fiscal stimulus, and legislation designed to deliver monetary aid and other relief to businesses and individuals impacted by the pandemic. In many locations throughout the United States, the spread of COVID-19 decreased substantially throughout the spring and summer of 2021, and, as a result, certain activity restrictions were lifted in whole or in part. However, due in large part to the increased spread of new, more transmissible coronavirus variants, the number of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 has increased substantially at the end of 2021 and early 2022.\nThe widespread availability of multiple COVID-19 vaccines and corresponding rates of vaccination generally have been effective in curtailing rates of infection in many parts of the United States, mitigating many of the adverse social and economic effects of the pandemic. COVID-19 vaccinations have continued to increase, including as a result of the approval of vaccine boosters, access to the vaccine for school-aged children, and the implementation of vaccine requirements by certain public sector and private sector employers. However, there remains significant resistance to vaccination in certain geographies and among certain groupings of people. Additionally, regulators have approved oral antiviral treatment pills, which have proven effective in reducing severe illness from COVID-19. Variant strains of the COVID-19 virus have appeared, notably the \u201cdelta\u201d and \u201comicron\u201d variants, further complicating efforts of the medical community and federal, state and local governments in response to the pandemic. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken currently or in the future by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic. Accordingly, the pandemic, and related efforts to contain it, continue to disrupt global economic activity and functioning of the financial markets, impact interest rates and monetary policy decisions, increase economic and market uncertainty, and disrupt trade and supply chains. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve, and the ongoing impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken currently or in the future by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic. While there have been trillions of dollars in economic stimulus packages initiated by the FRB and the federal government, in efforts to counteract the significant economic disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, some of which have expired or are due to expire in 2022, additional governmental stimulus and related interventions may be needed. There can be no assurance that any such additional stimulus will be forthcoming or that the previous stimulus packages will have been sufficient to counteract the adverse economic impact of the pandemic. Accordingly, the Company will continue to be operating under uncertain economic conditions.\nCertain industries have been particularly hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the travel and hospitality industry, the restaurant industry and the retail industry. Although we do not have a material concentration in the restaurant and retail industries, at December 31, 2021, we had $14.2 million of loans secured by SROs and hotels in our commercial real estate loan portfolio. In addition, the spread of COVID-19 also has caused us to modify our business practices, including curtailing employee travel, changing employee work locations and cancelling physical participation in meetings, events and conferences. We have many employees working remotely, and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners. Our ability to attract and retain employees may also be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including changing workforce concerns, expectations, practices and preferences (including remote work), and increasing labor shortages and competition for labor, which could increase labor costs. Our goal is, to the extent possible, to continue to provide the safest working conditions for all employees of the Bank.\nOur loan portfolio has been significantly affected by the economic disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, which contributed to our loan losses and delinquencies increasing in 2020, and we may need to increase our allowance for loan losses.\nThe economic disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in a significant increase in delinquencies and loans on nonaccrual status across our commercial real estate loan, construction loan and residential real estate loan portfolios as certain industries have been particularly hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has adversely affected the ability of many of our borrowers to repay their loans. The unemployment rate has improved in recent months from the 14.7% national unemployment rate observed in April 2020 to the 3.8% observed as of February 2022; however, disruptions in the labor markets caused by or relating to the pandemic, the Great Resignation (where record numbers of Americans quit their jobs during the second half of 2021) and associated fluctuations in rates of employment may have a significant adverse impact on the ability of our residential and multi-family borrowers to repay their loans. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, our commercial real estate loan portfolio includes loans secured by SROs, hotels, retail properties and offices totaling $201.2 million, representing 10% of total loans, including $14.2 million of loans secured by SROs and hotels. According to data from an independent real estate services firm, the office vacancy rate in San Francisco rose 3.2 percentage points from the fourth quarter of 2020, to 19.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, partially as a result of changes in work patterns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, operating cash flows from tenants have decreased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and decreased travel as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected our SRO borrowers by reducing demand from tourists for travel accommodations in San Francisco.\nAs a result of our evaluation of the current and expected impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and our loan portfolio, we may continue to experience similar loan losses and delinquencies in the current environment. Although our allowance for loan losses decreased by $15.9 million to $56.5 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $72.4 million at December 31, 2020, this decrease is primarily due to the reduction in our total loan portfolio, and our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans at December 31, 2021 was 2.81% compared to 2.89% at December 31, 2020. As the economic disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic continue and there are no assurances as to how long it will be before the COVID-19 pandemic abates and economic activity can begin to resume to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, we may need to increase our allowance for loan losses in future periods. Risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic are in addition to the credit risks to our portfolio set forth under \u201c-Risks Related to Credit.\u201d See also \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation-Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d for further discussion regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our allowance for loan losses, including that on our qualitative factors comprising our allowance for loan losses.\nThe expiration of governmental and regulatory actions intended to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in a material decline in our net income.\nCongress and various state governments and federal agencies have taken actions to require lenders to provide forbearance and other relief to borrowers (for example, waiving late payment and other fees). The federal banking agencies have encouraged financial institutions to work constructively with affected borrowers and recently passed legislation has provided relief from reporting loan classifications due to modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of these governmental and regulatory actions have expired or are set to decrease or expire in 2022. These actions consisted of eviction moratoria, loan repayment forbearances and other subsidies. Specifically, the federal eviction moratorium ended in August 2021; the California legislature responded by enacting some statewide eviction protections (which are in some cases supplemented by local ordinances), while the New York legislature extended the state\u2019s eviction moratorium until January 2022. Similarly, the Bank terminated its loan forbearance program in July 2021. We do not yet know what the impact of the discontinuation or mitigation of these actions will be on our customers and their ability to repay loans; however, should the expiration or decrease of such regulatory actions adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability to repay loans, then such may also adversely affect our net income or operating results. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Supervision and Regulation-Government and Regulatory Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d for further discussion of the status of the regulatory actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2021 and continuing into early 2022, the \u201comicron\u201d variant of the coronavirus has spread substantially and rapidly throughout the United States and globally. As a result, social and economic activity has been disrupted in many parts of the country. In response, members of Congress have begun to evaluate the prospects of approving additional stimulus payments, principally for businesses that have been most impacted by the recent increase in COVID-19 infections; however, the prospects and timing for any additional COVID-19 relief measures are not clear at this time.\nRisks Related to the Economy and Financial Markets\nAs a business operating in the financial services industry, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in numerous and complex ways by weak economic conditions and fiscal and monetary policies and regulations of the federal government and the FRB.\nOur business and operations, which primarily consist of lending money to customers in the form of loans, borrowing money from customers in the form of deposits and investing in securities, are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States. If the U.S. economy weakens, our growth and profitability from our lending, deposit and investment operations could be constrained. Uncertainty about the federal fiscal policymaking process, the medium- and long-term fiscal outlook of the federal government and future tax rates is a concern for businesses, consumers and investors in the United States. In addition, economic conditions in foreign countries could affect the stability of global financial markets, which could hinder U.S. economic growth. Weak economic conditions are characterized by deflation or elevated inflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, a lack of liquidity and/or depressed or inflated prices in the secondary market for mortgage loans, increased delinquencies on mortgage, consumer and commercial loans, residential and commercial real estate price declines and lower home sales and commercial activity. The current economic environment is also characterized by interest rates at historically low levels, which impacts our ability to attract deposits and to generate attractive net income through our investment portfolio, as well as elevated inflation, supply chain disruptions, a sensitive and evolving labor market and market volatility resulting from the recent military invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces, including the economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other nations on Russia, Belarus and certain Russian organizations and individuals. All of these factors are detrimental to our business, and the interplay between these factors can be complex and unpredictable. Our business is also significantly affected by monetary and related policies of the U.S. federal government and its agencies. Changes in any of these policies are influenced by macroeconomic conditions and other factors that are beyond our control. Adverse economic conditions and government policy responses to such conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nNotably, our net income and growth are affected by the policies of the FRB. An important function of the FRB is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the FRB to implement these objectives are open market purchases and sales of U.S. government securities, adjustments of the federal discount rate and changes in banks\u2019 reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The monetary policies and regulations of the FRB have had a significant effect on the operating results of banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The FRB has announced it will be reducing the pace of its open market purchases as well as monitoring interest rates in light of elevated inflation, labor market conditions and public health considerations, among other things. The effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted.\nOur customer activity is affected by changes in the state of the general economy and the financial markets, a slowdown or downturn of which could adversely affect demand for our loan services and our results of operations.\nOur customer activity is intrinsically linked to the health of the economy generally and of the financial markets specifically. In addition to the economic factors discussed above, a downturn in the real estate or commercial markets generally, which might occur as a result of, among other things, an increase in unemployment, further disruptions to the supply chain, a decrease in real estate values or a slowdown in housing demand, could cause our customers and potential customers to exit the market for real estate or commercial loans. As a result, we believe that fluctuations, disruptions, instability or downturns in the general economy and the financial markets could disproportionately affect demand for our residential and commercial loan services. If such conditions occur and persist, our business and financial results, including our liquidity and our ability to fulfill our debt obligations, could be materially adversely affected.\nFiscal challenges facing the U.S. government could negatively impact financial markets which, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nRecent federal budget deficit concerns and political conflict over legislation to raise the U.S. government\u2019s debt limit have increased the possibility of a default by the U.S. government on its debt obligations, related credit-rating downgrades, or an economic recession in the United States. Many of our investment securities are issued by the U.S. government and government agencies and sponsored entities. As a result of uncertain domestic political conditions, including the possibility of the federal government defaulting on its obligations for a period of time due to debt ceiling limitations or other unresolved political issues, investments in financial instruments issued or guaranteed by the federal government pose liquidity risks. In connection with prior political disputes over U.S. fiscal and budgetary issues leading to the U.S. government shutdown in 2011, S&P lowered its long-term sovereign credit rating on the U.S. from AAA to AA+. A further downgrade, or a similar downgrade by other rating agencies, in response to current political dynamics, as well as sovereign debt issues facing the governments of other countries, could have a material adverse impact on financial markets and economic conditions in the U.S. and worldwide.\nIncreases to the federal corporate tax rate would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in future periods.\nWe are subject to changes in tax law that could increase our effective tax rates. These law changes may be retroactive to previous periods and as a result could negatively affect our current and future financial performance. For example, legislation enacted in 2017 resulted in a reduction in our federal corporate tax rate from 35% in 2017 to 21% in 2018, which had a favorable impact on our earnings and capital generation abilities. However, this legislation also enacted limitations on certain deductions, such as the deduction of FDIC deposit insurance premiums, which partially offset the anticipated increase in net earnings from the lower tax rate. During 2021, Congress debated various proposals for increases in the corporate tax rate and possible surcharges on corporate share repurchases as part of the funding for various spending initiatives. Any such increase in the corporate tax rate or surcharges would adversely affect our results of operations in future periods.\nIn addition, the Bank\u2019s customers experienced and likely will continue to experience varying effects from both the individual and business tax provisions of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and other future changes in tax law and such effects, whether positive or negative, may have a corresponding impact on our business and the economy as a whole.\nRisks Related to Credit\nChanges in economic conditions could cause an increase in delinquencies and nonperforming assets, including loan charge offs, which could depress our net income and growth.\nOur loan portfolio includes primarily real estate secured loans, demand for which may decrease during economic downturns as a result of, among other things, an increase in unemployment, a decrease in real estate values and a slowdown in housing. Significant ongoing financial risk continues to affect economic conditions in the United States as a whole and in the markets that we serve. The OCC recently reported that although U.S. economic activity was strong throughout much of 2021 and banks remain in strong condition with sound capital and liquidity levels and financial market conditions are favorable, U.S. economic activity is expected to moderate in 2022 due to factors including elevated levels of inflation and the corresponding upward pressure on interest rates, high levels of commercial debt and uncertainty in both the commercial and residential real estate markets. As a result, we could experience higher delinquencies and loan charge offs, as well as nonaccrual loans and troubled debt restructurings, which would reduce our net income and adversely affect our financial condition. In addition, a decline in real estate values as a result of adverse developments in the markets we serve could reduce the value of the real estate collateral securing our real estate loans, which could cause some of our real estate loans to be inadequately collateralized or affect our ability to sell such collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses. Furthermore, to the extent that real estate collateral is obtained through foreclosure, the costs of holding and marketing the real estate collateral, as well as the ultimate values obtained from disposition, could reduce our net income and adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur concentration in residential real estate loans exposes us to risks.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, one-to-four family residential real estate loans amounted to $1.7 billion and $2.1 billion, or 83% and 81%, respectively, of our total gross loans, and we intend to continue this type of lending in the foreseeable future. Our nonperforming residential real estate loans increased from $20.8 million at December 31, 2020 to $45.7 million at December 31, 2021. Residential mortgage lending is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. For example, in our residential lending markets in California, the current unemployment rate is higher than the national average. If borrowers are unable to meet their loan repayment obligations, our results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, a decline in residential real estate values as a result of an economic downturn in the markets we serve would reduce the value of the real estate collateral securing these types of loans. Such declines in real estate values could cause some of our residential mortgages to be inadequately collateralized, which would expose us to a risk of loss if we sought to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral.\nOur commercial real estate loans are subject to credit risks, including changes in operating cash flows from the underlying properties or businesses, that may adversely impact our results of operation and financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2021, our commercial real estate loans totaled $254.9 million, or 12% of our total gross loans. Commercial real estate loans generally have more risk than residential real estate loans and generally have a larger average size compared to other types of loans, so losses incurred on a small number of commercial loans could have a disproportionate and material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The repayment of commercial real estate loans is often more sensitive than other types of loans to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the general business climate and economy because it is dependent on the successful operation or development of the property or business involved. In addition, the collateral for commercial real estate loans is generally less readily marketable than for residential real estate loans, and its value may be more difficult to determine. A primary repayment risk for commercial real estate loans is the interruption or discontinuation of operating cash flows from the properties or businesses involved, which may be influenced by economic events, changes in governmental regulations or other events not under the control of the borrower. Adverse developments affecting commercial real estate values in our market areas could increase the credit risk associated with these loans, impair the value of property pledged as collateral for these loans and affect our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses.\nOur construction loans are subject to a variety of risks that may adversely impact our results of operation and financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2021, our construction loans totaled $106.8 million, or 5% of our total gross loans. In addition to the risks generally applicable to commercial real estate loans, the risks inherent in construction lending include, among other things, the possibility that contractors may fail to complete-or complete on an untimely basis-construction of the relevant properties, substantial cost overruns in excess of original estimates and financing, market deterioration during construction and lack of permanent take-out financing of presold properties. Loans secured by such properties also involve additional risk because of the relatively limited operating history available for them. In these loans, loan funds are advanced upon the security of the project under construction (which is of uncertain value prior to completion of construction) and the estimated operating cash flow or sale proceeds to be generated by the completed project. To compete for construction loans, in prior years we generally originated loans where the borrowers\u2019 relative investment and value-at-risk in an underlying construction project were either at our policy limits for such exposures or constituted approved exceptions to these limits. As a result, changes in the expected value of a completed project may reduce those borrowers\u2019 economic incentives to complete a delayed construction project expediently. With many commercial construction projects requiring an extended time to market in the current COVID-19 environment, some of our borrowers have exhausted their liquidity. While we seek personal or affiliate guarantees for construction loans to provide alternative sources of repayment in the event that a project underperforms or fails to be completed, our assessments of guarantors\u2019 financial capacity to support repayment of these loans in light of their other commitments may not be correct, and guarantors\u2019 wealth and liquidity may be correlated with borrowers\u2019 business or economic conditions generally, which could make these guarantees less valuable as loan collateral when most needed.\nA substantial majority of our loans and operations are in California, and therefore our business is particularly vulnerable to a downturn in the local economies in which we operate.\nUnlike larger financial institutions that are more geographically diversified, a large portion of our business is concentrated primarily in the state of California, specifically in the San Francisco and Los Angeles areas. As of December 31, 2021, 85% of our loan portfolio was based in California with concentrations in the San Francisco and Los Angeles areas of 54% and 31%, respectively. If the local economies, and particularly local real estate markets, decline, the rates of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures, bankruptcies and losses in our loan portfolio would likely increase. Notably, the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and likely will continue to have, a significant effect on the California real estate market. In response to this crisis, California lawmakers have made funds available to borrowers in need of mortgage relief who have experienced a COVID-19-related financial hardship. Similarly, catastrophic natural events such as earthquakes or wildfires could have a disproportionate effect on our financial condition. As a result of this lack of geographic diversification in our loan portfolio, a downturn in the local economies generally and in real estate markets specifically could significantly reduce our profitability and growth and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses in our loan portfolio, and any resulting increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge offs could decrease our net income.\nLoan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of their loans, and the collateral securing the payment of their loans may be insufficient to assure repayment. We may experience significant credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, management periodically assesses various quantitative and qualitative factors affecting the loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of allowance for loan losses is subject to various assumptions and judgments and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and the collectability of loans, the value of real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans and future trends, all of which are subject to material changes. If our assumptions and estimates prove to be incorrect, the allowance for loan losses may not cover incurred losses in the loan portfolio at the date of the financial statements. Significant additions to the allowance for loan losses would materially decrease net income. Nonperforming loans may increase, and nonperforming or delinquent loans may adversely affect future performance. In addition, federal regulators periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge offs. Any significant increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge offs as required by these regulatory agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued an accounting standard update that will significantly change how we account for current expected credit losses and may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which replaces the current incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses with an expected loss model referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) model. Under the CECL model, we will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the current incurred loss model, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Accordingly, we expect that the adoption of the CECL model will materially affect how we determine our allowance for loan losses and may require us to significantly increase our allowance for loan losses. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our allowance for loan losses. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for loan losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are currently evaluating the impact the CECL model will have on our accounting. At this time, a cross-functional implementation team consisting of individuals from accounting, finance, servicing and information systems is working with the Bank\u2019s loan system vendor, and they have developed an application to create credit loss estimation models and processes. The historical data set for model development has been finalized, and the credit loss estimation models have been developed and tested. Once the credit loss estimation models are finalized, the Bank will run the new credit loss estimation models in parallel with the current allowance for loan losses model to understand the differences in the models and assess the impact of the change. We expect to recognize an adjustment to our allowance for loan losses and a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2023, the beginning of the first reporting period in which the new standard is effective. We have not yet determined the magnitude of any such one-time cumulative adjustment or of the overall impact of the new standard on our financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Highly Regulated Industry\nOur business is limited by the highly regulated environment in which we operate and could be adversely affected by the extensive laws and regulations that govern our activities, operations, corporate governance and accounting principles, or changes in any of them.\nAs a unitary thrift holding company, we are subject to extensive examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by various federal agencies that govern almost all aspects of our operations. These laws and regulations, among other things, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on the business activities in which we can engage, limit the dividend or distributions that Sterling Bank can pay to us, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee our debt and impose certain specific accounting requirements on us. These laws and regulations are not intended to protect our shareholders. Rather, these laws and regulations are intended to protect customers, depositors, the DIF and the overall financial stability of the United States. Compliance with these laws and regulations is difficult and costly, and changes to these laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure follows good faith effort or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines and other penalties, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, capital base and the price of our securities. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive.\nFailure to satisfy the QTL test may subject us to regulatory enforcement actions and restrict our ability to pay dividends.\nAs a federal savings bank, Sterling Bank must satisfy the QTL test. Under the QTL test, Sterling Bank is required to maintain at least 65% of its portfolio assets (that is, total assets less (1) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, (2) intangibles, including goodwill, and (3) the value of property used to conduct business) in certain qualified thrift investments (primarily mortgage loans secured by one-to-four family and multifamily residential properties and related investments, including certain mortgage-backed securities, credit card loans, student loans, and small business loans) on a monthly basis during at least 9 out of every 12 months. A savings association that fails the QTL test immediately will be prohibited from: (1) making any new investment or engaging in any new activity not permissible for a national bank, (2) paying dividends, unless such payment would be permissible for a national bank, is necessary to meet the obligations of a company that controls the savings association, and is specifically approved by the OCC and the FRB, and (3) establishing any new branch office in a location not permissible for a national bank in the association\u2019s home state. A savings association that fails to meet the QTL test is deemed to have violated the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Act and, as discussed further below, may be subject to OCC enforcement action. In addition, if a savings association does not requalify under the QTL test within three years after failing the test, the association would be prohibited from retaining any investment or engaging in any activity not permissible for a national bank.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act made noncompliance with the QTL test subject to agency enforcement action for a violation of law. At December 31, 2021, Sterling Bank satisfied the QTL test. However, if our commercial portfolio continues to grow and we are unable to replace the lost residential loan production resulting from the permanent discontinuation of our Advantage Loan Program, we may fail to maintain our QTL status in future periods. In such event, we could be forced to buy mortgage-backed securities or other qualifying assets at times when the terms of such investments may not be attractive. Alternatively, we may find it necessary to pursue different structures, including converting the Bank\u2019s savings bank charter to a commercial bank charter. Absent such strategies, if we fail to satisfy the QTL test, we could become subject to regulatory enforcement actions and our ability to pay dividends may be severely restricted.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act may continue to affect our business, governance structure, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, imposed new capital requirements on thrift holding companies; changed the base for FDIC insurance assessments to a bank\u2019s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, rather than upon its deposit base; permanently raised the current standard deposit insurance limit to $250,000; and expanded the FDIC\u2019s authority to raise insurance premiums. The Dodd-Frank Act also established the CFPB as an independent entity within the FRB, which has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards and contains provisions on mortgage-related matters, such as steering incentives, determinations as to a borrower\u2019s ability to repay and prepayment penalties. Although the applicability of certain elements of the Dodd-Frank Act is limited to institutions with more than $10 billion in assets, there can be no guarantee that such applicability will not be extended in the future or that regulators or other third parties will not seek to impose such requirements on institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Company. The Dodd-Frank Act has had and may continue to have a material impact on our operations, particularly through increased regulatory burden and compliance costs.\nWe are subject to stringent capital requirements.\nWe are subject to the regulatory capital rules implemented by the U.S. federal banking agencies in accordance with Basel III regulatory capital reforms and the Dodd-Frank Act. The regulatory capital rules are generally applicable to all U.S. banks as well as to unitary thrift holding companies with assets over $1 billion, such as the Company. The regulatory capital rules establish minimum regulatory capital ratios, including a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, and require maintenance of a CCB. The rules prescribe criteria that capital instruments must meet in order to be considered additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital for the purposes of the above requirements.\nIn order to be a well capitalized depository institution under the regulatory capital rules, an institution must maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5% or more; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8% or more; a total capital ratio of 10% or more; and a leverage ratio of 5% or more. Institutions must also maintain a CCB consisting of common equity Tier 1 capital. Further, qualifying community banking organizations may elect to utilize the CBLR framework, which provides a simplified measure of capital adequacy. In order to qualify for the CBLR framework, a community banking organization must have (i) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of greater than 9.0%, (ii) less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, and (iii) limited amounts of off-balance-sheet exposures and trading assets and liabilities. The Bank is eligible to utilize the CBLR framework but has not yet determined to do so.\nThe failure to meet applicable regulatory capital requirements could result in one or more of our regulators placing limitations or conditions on our activities, including our growth initiatives, or restricting the commencement of new activities, and could materially adversely affect customer and investor confidence, our costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock, our ability to make acquisitions, and our business, results of operations and financial conditions, generally.\nThe Company faces risks related to the adoption of future legislation and potential changes in federal regulatory agency leadership, policies and priorities.\nCongress may enact legislation from time to time that affects the regulation of the financial services industry, and state legislatures may enact legislation from time to time affecting the regulation of financial institutions chartered by or operating in those states. Federal and state regulatory agencies also periodically propose and adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. The substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulation, or the application thereof, cannot be predicted, although enactment of the proposed legislation could impact the regulatory structure under which we operate and may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital and modify our business strategy, and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner.\nDemocrats assumed control of the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate in 2021, albeit with a Senate majority found only in the tie-breaking vote of Vice President Kamala Harris. With control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, Democrats are now able to set the policy agenda both legislatively and in the regulatory agencies that have rulemaking and supervisory authority over the financial services industry, which includes Sterling Bancorp and the Bank. Congressional committees with jurisdiction over the financial services sector have pursued oversight and legislative initiatives in a variety of areas, including addressing climate-related risks, promoting diversity and equality within the banking industry and addressing other Environmental, Social and Governance or \u201cESG\u201d matters, improving competition in the banking sector and increasing oversight of bank mergers and acquisitions, establishing a regulatory framework for digital assets and markets and overseeing the COVID-19 pandemic response and economic recovery. The prospects for the enactment of major banking reform legislation under the current Congress are unclear at this time.\nMoreover, the turnover of the Administration has resulted in certain changes in the leadership and senior staffs of the federal banking agencies, the CFPB, CFTC, SEC, and the Treasury Department, with certain significant leadership positions yet to be filled, including the Comptroller of the Currency, the Chair of the FDIC and three vacancies on the FRB, including the Vice Chair for Supervision. These changes have impacted the rulemaking, supervision, examination and enforcement priorities and policies of the agencies and likely will continue to do so over the next several years. The potential impact of any changes in agency personnel, policies and priorities on the financial services sector, including Sterling Bancorp and the Bank, cannot be predicted at this time.\nWe are subject to the CRA and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nThe CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The CRA requires the OCC, in connection with its examination of a federally chartered savings association, to assess the institution\u2019s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution. All institutions insured by the FDIC must publicly disclose their rating. The CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The fair lending laws prohibit discrimination in the provision of banking services on the basis of prohibited factors including, among others, race, color, national origin, gender, and religion. The enforcement of these laws has been an increasing focus for the CFPB, HUD and other regulators. Under the fair lending laws, we may be liable if our policies result in a disparate treatment of or have a disparate impact on a protected class of applicants or borrowers and may also be subject to investigation by the DOJ. A successful challenge to our institution\u2019s performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity and restrictions on expansion activity. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge our performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation.\nFederal regulators periodically examine our business, and we may be required to remediate adverse examination findings.\nThe FRB and the OCC periodically examine our business operations, including our sales practices, supervisory procedures and internal controls, recordkeeping practices and financial position, to determine our compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to protect the solvency and safety and soundness of our organization. If, as a result of an examination, a federal banking agency were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, interest rate risk and liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we were in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include, among others, the power to enjoin unsafe or unsound practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance and place us into receivership or conservatorship. If we become subject to any regulatory actions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.\nThe FRB or OCC may require us to commit capital resources to support Sterling Bank.\nAs a matter of policy, the FRB expects a unitary thrift holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the FRB\u2019s policy on serving as a source of financial strength. Under the source of strength doctrine, the FRB may require a unitary thrift holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the unitary thrift holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to a subsidiary bank. A capital injection may be required at times when the holding company may not have the resources to provide it and therefore may be required to borrow the funds or raise capital. Any loans by a holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In the event of a unitary thrift\u2019s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the institution\u2019s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations. Thus, any borrowing that must be done by the Company to make a required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The requirement that we serve as a source of strength to our Bank may be exacerbated by OCC requirements to maintain certain capital requirements at the bank level and we may not be able to access the necessary funds to do so, which would further materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRecent actions by the Biden Administration regarding competition in the financial services and technology sectors may adversely impact our business.\nOn July 9, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy (the \u201cExecutive Order\u201d). Among other initiatives, the Executive Order (i) encourages the federal banking agencies to review their current merger oversight practices under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and the Bank Merger Act and, within 180 days of the date of the Executive Order, adopt a plan for revitalization of such practices; and (ii) directs the CFPB to commence or continue a rulemaking to facilitate the portability of consumer financial transaction data for the purpose of providing consumers with greater flexibility in switching financial institutions and using innovative financial products. In addition, the Director of the CFPB has publicly sought a greater role for the CFPB in the evaluation of proposed bank mergers. Any enhanced regulatory scrutiny of bank mergers and acquisitions and the revision of the framework for merger application review may adversely affect the marketplace for such transactions. Any such enhanced scrutiny or new rules that possibly limit the size of financial institutions may adversely impact certain strategic alternatives that may be available to us, including possibly combining with a larger financial institution.\nSimilarly, although the CFPB has published principles for consumer-authorized financial data sharing and aggregation, we cannot predict the scope, substance or timing of any future CFPB rulemaking regarding the portability of financial transaction data in response to the Executive Order. The impact of any such rulemaking on the conduct of our customers also cannot be predicted. However, the adoption of any such rule could result in increased volatility of consumer accounts and expose the Company to additional operational, strategic, regulatory and compliance risks.\nRisks Related to Competition\nStrong competition within our market areas or with respect to our products and pricing may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market area, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms and unregulated or less regulated non-banking entities, operating locally and elsewhere. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and higher lending limits than we have and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide.In addition, some of our competitors offer loans with lower interest rates on more attractive terms than loans we offer.Competition also makes it increasingly difficult and costly to attract and retain qualified employees.Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market areas. If we must raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on our loans, our net interest margin and profitability could be adversely affected.\nOur strategy for future growth relies in part on growth in the communities we serve and our ability to develop relationships in particular locations, and we expect to continue to face strong competition from competitors in all of our markets. In addition, our competitors may seek to benefit from the recent negative publicity surrounding our permanent discontinuation of the Advantage Loan Program and target our customers. If we fail to compete effectively against our competitors, we may be unable to expand our market share in our existing markets, and we may be unable to retain our existing market share in key growth markets or in those markets in which we have traditionally had a strong presence. Failure to protect our market share on a regional level or to grow our market share in key growth markets and product categories could have a material adverse effect on our overall market share and on our profitability.\nOur modest size makes it more difficult to compete with other financial institutions, which are generally larger and able to achieve economies of scale and can more easily afford to invest in the marketing and technologies needed to attract and retain customers and to offer better pricing for the type of products and services we provide. Because our principal source of income is the net interest income we earn on our loans and investments after deducting interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds, our ability to generate the revenues needed to cover our expenses and finance such investments is limited by the size of our loan and investment portfolios. Accordingly, we are not always able to offer new products and services as quickly as our competitors. As a smaller institution, we are also disproportionately affected by the continually increasing costs of compliance with new banking and other regulations.\nIn addition, we believe that we have historically faced less competition for customers of our former Advantage Loan Program compared to the competition we face in the market for QMs. Due to the permanent discontinuation of the Advantage Loan Program,\nwe may face significant pricing pressure and may experience a negative effect on our net interest margin. Should competition over the type of loans we underwrite increase, our profitability could be materially and adversely affected.\nConsumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions through alternative methods that historically have involved banks. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts, mutual funds or general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards. Consumers can also complete transactions, such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks.\nTransactions utilizing digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and other similar assets have increased substantially. Certain characteristics of digital asset transactions, such as the speed with which such transactions can be conducted, the ability to transact without the involvement of regulated intermediaries and the ability to engage in transactions across multiple jurisdictions are appealing to certain consumers, notwithstanding the various risks posed by such transactions. Accordingly, digital asset service providers-which, at present, are not subject to the extensive regulation as banking organizations and other financial institutions-have become active competitors for our customers\u2019 banking business. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \u201cdisintermediation,\u201d could result in the loss of fee income and the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are a community bank, and our reputation is critical to the success of our business but may continue to be affected by negative publicity.\nWe are a community bank, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. Recent negative publicity regarding the Advantage Loan Program has caused substantial damage to our reputation in the communities we serve and the outcome of the pending government investigations may further damage our reputation. Significant harm to our reputation can arise from various other sources, including officer, director or employee misconduct; actual or perceived unethical behavior; conflicts of interest; security breaches; litigation or regulatory outcomes; compensation practices; failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality; failing to address customer and agency complaints; compliance failures; unauthorized release of personal, proprietary or confidential information due to cyberattacks or otherwise; perception of our environmental, social and governance practices and disclosures; and the activities of our clients, customers and counterparties, including vendors. Actions by the financial services industry generally or by institutions or individuals in the industry also can adversely affect our reputation indirectly, by association. In addition, adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media, whether or not factually correct, may affect our business prospects. All of these could adversely affect our growth, results of operation and financial condition.\nWe must keep pace with technological change to remain competitive and introduce new products and services.\nFinancial products and services have become increasingly technologically driven. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively and introduce new products in a cost-efficient manner is dependent on the ability to keep pace with technological advances, to invest in new technology as it becomes available, and to obtain and maintain related essential personnel. Many of our competitors have already implemented critical technologies and have greater resources to invest in technology than we do and may be better equipped to market new technologically driven products and services. In addition, we may not have the same ability to rapidly respond to technological innovations as our competitors do. Furthermore, the introduction of new technologies and products by financial technology companies and financial technology platforms, including the potential utilization of blockchain technology to provide alternative high speed payment systems, may adversely affect our ability to obtain new customers and successfully grow our business. The increased demand for, and availability of, alternative payment systems and currencies not only increases competition for such services, but has created a more complex operating environment that, in certain cases, may require additional or different controls to manage fraud, operational, legal and compliance risks. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative and regulatory changes and continued consolidation. In July 2018, the OCC announced that it will begin accepting applications from financial technology companies to become special purpose national banks. Although the OCC\u2019s authority to issue special purpose bank charters to nonbank financial technology companies continues to be subject to ongoing litigation, similar developments are likely to result in even greater competition within all areas of our operations. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important, and the failure to do so, due to cost, proficiency or otherwise, could have a material adverse impact on our business and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Interest Rates\nFuture changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and otherwise negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe majority of our banking assets are monetary in nature and subject to risk from changes in interest rates. Like most financial institutions, our net income and cash flows depend to a great extent upon the level of our net interest income, or the difference between the interest income we earn on loans, investments and other interest earning assets and the interest we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Changes in interest rates can increase or decrease our net interest income, which makes up a majority of our income, because different types of assets and liabilities may react differently, and at different times, to market interest rate changes.\nThe rates we earn on our assets and the rates we pay on our liabilities are generally fixed for a contractual period of time. Like many savings institutions, our liabilities generally have shorter contractual maturities than our assets. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree than interest earning assets in a period, an increase in interest rates could reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income. Additionally, an increase in interest rates may, among other things, reduce the demand for residential mortgage and other loans and our ability to originate loans and decrease loan repayment rates. A decrease in the general level of interest rates may affect us through, among other things, increased prepayments on our loan portfolio and mortgage-backed securities as borrowers refinance their debt to reduce their borrowing costs. This creates reinvestment risk, which is the risk that we may not be able to reinvest prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates we earned on the prepaid loans or securities. Furthermore, an inverted interest rate yield curve, where short-term interest rates (which are usually the rates at which financial institutions borrow funds) are higher than long-term interest rates (which are usually the rates at which financial institutions lend funds for fixed-rate loans) can reduce our net interest margin and create financial risk for financial institutions like ours. Also impacting our net interest income and net interest rate spread is the level of prepayment activity on our mortgage-related assets. Mortgage prepayment rates will vary due to a number of factors, including the regional economy where the mortgage loan or the underlying mortgages of the mortgage-backed security were originated, seasonal factors and demographic variables. However, the major factors affecting prepayment rates are the prevailing market interest rates, related mortgage refinancing opportunities and competition. Generally, the level of prepayment activity directly affects the yield earned on those assets, as the payments received on the interest-earning assets will be reinvested at the prevailing market interest rate. In a rising interest rate environment, prepayment rates tend to decrease and, therefore, the yield earned on our existing mortgage-related assets will remain constant instead of increasing. This would adversely affect our net interest margin and, therefore, our net interest income.\nThe interest we earn on our assets is primarily from our residential real estate loans, which comprises 83% of our total gross loans at December 31, 2021 and 77% of the interest earned from all of our interest-earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nWe offer fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans with terms of up to 30 years; however, across our loan portfolio, interest rates and payments adjust annually after a one-, three-, five- or seven-year initial fixed period. At December 31, 2021, 99% of our residential real estate loan portfolio and 94% of our total loan portfolio were adjustable-rate loans. To that end, 62% of our adjustable-rate residential real estate loans\u2019 repricing dates are currently scheduled to occur within the next 12 months, 35% within the next 60 months, and 3% thereafter. That is, in addition to the risk that the demand for residential mortgage and other loans may be reduced in an environment where interest rates are rising, our existing loan portfolio may be locked into an interest rate that is less than the prevailing market rates in an increasing interest rate environment. This likewise creates reinvestment risk, as we may not be able to originate new loans fast enough for our entire loan portfolio to keep up with prevailing interest rates and we are not yet able to offer new loan products to the market with interest rate terms more favorable to us, as we remain subject to the OCC Agreement. To help address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and financial markets, in March 2020 the Federal Open Market Committee (\u201cFOMC\u201d) reduced the benchmark federal funds rate to a target range of 0% to 0.25%, and the yields on 10- and 30-year Treasury notes declined to historic lows. In January 2022, the FOMC announced that it will be slowing down its relief programs, including reducing the pace of its bond purchases, and that it expects that it may soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate in light of elevated inflation and the strong labor market, though still acknowledging that the path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the COVID-19 virus.\nAccordingly, changes in the level of market interest rates affect our net yield on interest earning assets, loan origination volume and our overall results. We expect the operating environment to remain very challenging as the FRB continues to focus their efforts on the economy. We cannot predict future FRB actions or other factors that will cause rates to change. If we were to experience a rising interest rate environment where our cost of funds increased faster than the yields on our loan portfolio, it may adversely affect our net interest income, net interest spread and net interest margin, and may cause us to change our operating leverage model or portfolio mix to compensate. Although our asset-liability management strategy is designed to control and mitigate exposure to the risks related to changes in market interest rates, those rates are affected by many factors outside of our control, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, deflation, recession, changes in unemployment, the money supply, international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets. Such changes in interest rates could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and overall profitability.\nIncreasing interest rates could reduce our net interest income and otherwise negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOver the past several years, the FRB\u2019s policy has been to maintain interest rates at historically low levels through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of mortgage-backed securities. After steadily increasing the target federal funds rate in 2017 and 2018, the FRB in 2019 decreased the target federal funds rate by 75 basis points, and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, decreased the target federal funds rate by an additional 150 basis points to a range of 0.0% to 0.25% as of March 31, 2020. However, in light of elevated inflation and a strong labor market, the FOMC indicated it would be slowing down its relief programs and that it expects to raise the target range for the federal funds rate. If the FRB increases the target federal funds rate, overall interest rates will likely rise, which may negatively impact the housing markets and the U.S. economic recovery. Our ability to reduce our interest expense may be limited at current interest rate levels while the average yield on our interest-earning assets may continue to decrease, and our interest expense may increase as we access non-core funding sources or increase deposit rates to fund our operations. If we were to experience a rising interest rate environment where our cost of funds increased faster than the yields on our loan portfolio, it may adversely affect our net interest income, net interest spread and net interest margin, and may cause us to change our operating leverage model or portfolio mix to compensate.\nUncertainty relating to the LIBOR discontinuation and replacement may adversely affect our results of operations.\nLIBOR has historically been the reference rate used for many of our transactions, including our lending and borrowing and our purchase and sale of securities that we use to manage risk related to such transactions. However, a reduced volume of interbank unsecured term borrowing coupled with recent legal and regulatory proceedings related to rate manipulation by certain financial institutions led to international reconsideration of LIBOR as a financial benchmark. The United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates the process for establishing LIBOR, announced in July 2017 that the sustainability of LIBOR cannot be guaranteed. The administrator for LIBOR permanently ceased to publish most LIBOR settings on January 1, 2022 and will cease to publish the overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month USD LIBOR settings on July 1, 2023. Accordingly, the FCA stopped persuading, or compelling, banks to submit to LIBOR after 2021. To that end, the FRB, the OCC and the FDIC encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts that reference LIBOR by December 31, 2021. In addition, banks have been encouraged to identify contracts that extend beyond June 30, 2023 and implement plans to identify and address insufficient contingency provisions in those contracts.\nOn April 6, 2021, legislation was adopted in New York State that provides for the use of a statutory replacement for USD LIBOR in certain New York law legacy contracts. On March 15, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022, which among other things, provides for the use of interest rates based on SOFR in certain contracts currently based on LIBOR and a safe harbor from liability for utilizing SOFR-based interest rates as a replacement for LIBOR. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d), a group of private-market participants convened by the FRB and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the \u201cFRBNY\u201d) to help ensure a successful transition from LIBOR, also selected the SOFR as an alternative to LIBOR.\nThe FRBNY has published SOFR since May 2018, which is intended to be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. The FRBNY reports that SOFR includes all trades in the Broad General Collateral Rate, plus bilateral U.S. Treasury repurchase agreement transactions cleared through the delivery-versus-payment service offered by the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, a subsidiary of the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation. The FRBNY currently publishes SOFR daily on its website at https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/sofr and states on its publication page\nfor SOFR that use of SOFR is subject to important disclaimers, limitations and indemnification obligations, including that the FRBNY may alter the methods of calculation, publication schedule, rate revision practices or availability of SOFR at any time without notice.\nPursuant to the federal and New York State legislation, we have determined that our LIBOR-based loans and outstanding subordinated notes will convert to SOFR-based rates. We ceased originating loans referencing LIBOR on March 8, 2021 and began originating U.S. Treasury rate based loans thereafter; however, our adjustable-rate loan products that are LIBOR-indexed currently continue to reset based on LIBOR. In addition, we have established a LIBOR Review Committee to review the risks associated with its LIBOR transition, including reviewing the Bank\u2019s loan portfolios for contract remediation and is preparing the Bank\u2019s operational readiness to support rate fallback and conversion mechanisms across all loans that currently reference LIBOR, as applicable.\nThere can be no assurances as to whether other market participants will adopt SOFR or what the relevant spread adjustments that the FRB may select for financial instruments that are currently referencing LIBOR will be. The discontinuation of LIBOR may result in uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instruments and may also increase operational and other risks to us and the industry.\nBecause SOFR is published by the FRBNY based on data received from other sources, the Bank has no control over its determination, calculation or publication. There can be no assurance that SOFR will not be discontinued or fundamentally altered in a manner that is materially adverse to the parties that utilize SOFR as the reference rate for transactions.\nThere is no assurance that SOFR-based rates will be sufficient to produce the economic equivalent of LIBOR, either at the replacement date or over the life of the applicable financial instrument. Further, if SOFR-based rates have not achieved sufficient market acceptance when the publication of the principal tenors of LIBOR is discontinued, or if market participants have not otherwise implemented effective transitional arrangements to address that discontinuation, widespread dislocation in the financial markets, volatility in the pricing of securities and other financial instruments, and the suppression of capital markets activity may ensue. In addition, financial instruments referencing SOFR may have additional legal, financial, tax, operational, market, compliance, reputational, competitive or other risks to us, our customers and other market participants. To that end, banking regulators in the U.S. have increased regulatory scrutiny and intensified supervisory focus of financial institution LIBOR transition plans, preparations and readiness, which may result in a regulatory action, litigation or the need to change the products we offer.\nThe market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, including SOFR, is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In particular, any such transition could:\n\u25cf adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, and the revenue and expenses associated with, our floating rate obligations, loans, deposits and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally;\n\u25cf adversely affect the value of our floating rate obligations, loans, deposits and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR's role in determining market interest rates globally;\n\u25cf prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of our preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with SOFR;\n\u25cf result in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based securities; and\n\u25cf require the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition our risk management processes from LIBOR-based products to those based on SOFR.\nIn addition, the implementation of LIBOR reform proposals may result in increased compliance costs and operational costs, including costs related to continued participation in LIBOR and the transition to SOFR-based rates. We cannot reasonably estimate the expected cost.\nRisks Related to Liquidity\nA lack of liquidity could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and result in regulatory limits being placed on the Company.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. We rely on our ability to generate deposits and effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of our loans to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to fund our operations. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our most important source of funds is deposits. Deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. If customers move money out of deposits such as money market funds, we will lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and net income. In addition, should secondary market investors accept our offers to repurchase Advantage Loan Program loans with respect to the remaining portion of such outstanding loans, the cash required to fund these repurchases will reduce our excess liquidity. Moreover, depending on the capitalization and regulatory treatment of depository institutions, including whether an institution is subject to a supervisory prompt corrective action directive, certain additional regulatory restrictions and prohibitions may apply, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. In the event such restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits become applicable to us, we will likely need to reduce our interest rates paid on a large segment of our deposits, which could result in significant deposit withdrawals. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, approximately 19% of our total deposits are not FDIC-insured, and a significant portion of those deposits could be withdrawn in the event of volatile economic conditions. Significant deposit withdrawals could materially reduce our liquidity, and, in such an event, we may be required to replace such deposits with higher-costing borrowings.\nOther primary sources of funds consist of cash flows from operations and sales of investment securities, and proceeds from the issuance and sale of our equity securities. Additional liquidity is provided by our ability to borrow from the FHLB of Indianapolis or our ability to sell portions of our loan portfolio. We also may borrow funds from third-party lenders, such as other financial institutions. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities, or on terms that are acceptable to us, could be impaired by factors that affect us directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry. Our access to funding sources could also be affected by a decrease in the ability to sell mortgage portfolios as a result of a downturn in our markets or by one or more adverse regulatory actions against us. A lack of liquidity could also attract increased regulatory scrutiny and potential restraints imposed on us by regulators.\nAny decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses or fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on external financing to fund our operations, and the failure to obtain such financing on favorable terms, or at all, in the future could materially and adversely impact our growth strategy and prospects.\nWe rely in part on advances from the FHLB and brokered deposits to fund our operations. Although we consider such sources of funds adequate for our current needs, we may need to seek additional debt or equity capital in the future to restore capital that may be depleted due to losses related to adverse results from government investigations and ligations, adverse economic conditions due to COVID-19 and other risks identified herein, as well as to fund future growth. The sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future may be dilutive to our shareholders, and debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge some of our assets and enter into various affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on operational activities and financing alternatives. Future financing sources, if sought, might be unavailable to us or, if available, could be on terms unfavorable to us and may require regulatory approval. In addition, we currently are required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB in order for the Company to issue any new debt. If financing sources are unavailable or are not available on favorable terms or we are unable to obtain regulatory approval, our capital base, growth strategy and future prospects could be materially and adversely impacted.\nIf the market for the sale of our mortgage loans to the secondary market were to significantly contract, or if purchasers were to lose confidence in the quality of our loans, our net income would be negatively affected and our ability to manage our balance sheet would be materially and adversely affected.\nFrom time to time, we manage our liquidity and balance sheet risk by selling loans in our mortgage portfolio into the secondary market. If the market for our mortgages were to contract or our counterparties were to lose confidence in our asset quality, we would lose a key piece of our liquidity strategy and would need to find alternative means to manage our liquidity that may be less effective. In addition, in connection with residential mortgages packaged for sale in the secondary market, we make representations and warranties, which, if breached, may require us to repurchase such loans, substitute other loans or indemnify the purchasers of such loans for actual losses incurred in respect of such loans. To avoid the uncertainty of audits and inquiries by third-party investors in Advantage Loan Program loans sold to the secondary market, beginning at the end of the second quarter of 2020, we commenced making offers to each of those investors to repurchase 100% of our previously sold Advantage Loan Program loans. As of December 31, 2021, we had repurchased such loans with an aggregate principal balance of $243.5 million and had outstanding commitments to repurchase an additional $73.0 million over the next 18 months. At December 31, 2021, the unpaid principal balance of residential mortgage loans sold under the Advantage Loan Program that were subject to potential repurchase obligations for breach of representations and warranties totaled $142.8 million. If we experience loan repurchase demands in excess of what we have anticipated, our liquidity, capital ratios and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe debt service obligations related to our subordinated notes will reduce the funds available for other business purposes, and the terms and covenants relating thereto, and to any future indebtedness, could adversely impact our financial performance and liquidity.\nWe have outstanding $65.0 million in aggregate principal amount on our subordinated notes due April 15, 2026. Our subordinated notes bear interest at a variable interest rate of the three-month LIBOR rate plus a margin of 5.82%. For 2021, the average interest rate was 6.31%, and the interest rate was 5.94% at December 31, 2021. Pursuant to recent federal and New York State legislation, upon the cessation of the publication of the three-month LIBOR rate, currently expected in June 2023, the subordinated notes will bear interest at a rate based on SOFR. As a result of our subordinated notes, we are currently, and to the extent we incur significant debt in the future, we will be, subject to risks typically associated with debt financing, such as insufficient cash flow to meet required debt service payment obligations, which may increase if the benchmark rate for any of our floating rate notes increases, and the inability to refinance existing indebtedness. See Note 9-Subordinated Notes, net to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the economic terms of our subordinated notes.\nIn addition, our subordinated notes and the related subordinated note purchase agreements contain customary covenants, which under certain circumstances place restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions and enter into certain transactions, including acquisition activity. If we fail to satisfy one or more of the covenants under our subordinated notes, we would be in default under such notes, and may be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources. Under such circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available to us on reasonable terms or at all.\nOther Risks Related to Our Business\nOur senior management has undergone a significant transition, and our future success depends on our ability to identify, attract and retain key employees and other qualified personnel.\nThe Company experienced significant executive transitions in late 2019 continuing through the first half of 2020. Since October 1, 2019, more than 150 officers and employees have been terminated or have resigned, including more than 45 loan officers, whether in connection with the Internal Review or otherwise. As a result, beginning in 2020 and continuing through 2021, we have undergone significant effort to hire new employees and retain existing employees, which effort is continuing in 2022. However, we may not be successful in retaining our key employees, or replacing recently terminated or departed employees, and the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our officers or directors could have a material adverse effect on our business because of their skills, knowledge of our market and financial products, years of industry experience and the difficulty of finding qualified replacement personnel. We recognize that the banking industry is competitive and replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully manage, develop and grow in the banking industry. If we fail to identify and develop or recruit successors, we are at risk of being harmed by the departures of key employees.\nWe face risks related to our operational, technological and organizational infrastructure.\nOur ability to grow and compete, including to develop and deliver new products that meet the needs of our existing customers and attract new ones, is dependent on our ability to build or acquire the necessary operational and technological infrastructure and to manage the cost of that infrastructure as we expand. Our ability to run our business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations is also dependent on that infrastructure. Operational risk can manifest itself in many ways, such as errors related to failed or inadequate processes, faulty or disabled computer systems, fraud by employees or outside persons and exposure to external events, and we are dependent on our operational infrastructure to help manage these risks. In addition, we are heavily dependent on the strength and capability of our technology systems, which we use both to interface with our customers and to manage our internal financial records and other systems. Any shortcomings in our technology systems subjects us to risk of misconduct by our employees that may go undetected.\nWe monitor our operational and technological capabilities and make modifications and improvements when we believe it will be cost effective to do so. If we experience difficulties, fail to comply with banking regulations or keep up with increasingly sophisticated technologies, our operations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps materially. Even if we are able to replace them, it may be at a higher cost to us, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThird-party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure and our technology framework, such as internet connections, network access and core application processing. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully in accordance with supervisory requirements, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise to conduct our business. Replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense. These third-party vendors are also subject to the same cyber risks and other risks that we encounter. These third-party risks continue to be an area of supervisory focus, so we will need to ensure the proper framework is in place to address them.\nIf our enterprise risk management framework is not effective at mitigating risk and loss to us, we could suffer unexpected losses and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur enterprise risk management framework seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between risk and return, which is critical to optimizing shareholder value. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit, liquidity, operational, regulatory, compliance and reputational risks. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe face significant operational risks because the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions and increased reliance on technology, including risk of loss related to cybersecurity or privacy breaches.\nWe operate in diverse markets and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a high number of transactions and to collect, process, transmit and store significant amounts of confidential information regarding our customers, employees and others, as well as our own business, operations, plans and strategies. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside our company, the execution of unauthorized transactions, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, systems failures or interruptions, breaches of our internal control systems and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery. We face an increasing number of regulations and regulatory scrutiny related to our information technology systems, and security or privacy breaches with respect to our data could result in regulatory fines, reputational harm and customer losses, any of which would significantly impact our financial condition. As cybersecurity threats are inherently difficult to predict and can take many forms, insurance coverage may not be available for losses associated with cyberattacks or information security breaches, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. In addition, we may not be able to rely on indemnification or another source of third-party recovery in the event of a breach of such functions.\nIn addition, we outsource some of our data processing to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, including as a result of cyberattacks or information security breaches, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nAlthough we have implemented and intend to continue to implement and enhance security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent such damage, there can be no assurance that these security measures will be successful in deterring or mitigating the effects of every cyberthreat that we face. In addition, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we and our third-party service providers use to protect client transaction data, other customer data and employee data. Any successful cyber-attack or other information security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer information or that compromises our ability to function could severely damage our reputation, erode confidence in the security of our systems, products and services, expose us to the risk of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business. Any successful cyber-attack may also subject the Company to regulatory investigations, litigation or enforcement, or require the payment of regulatory fines or penalties or undertaking costly remediation efforts with respect to third parties affected by a cybersecurity incident, all or any of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations and damage its reputation.\nCyberattacks, including those targeting critical infrastructure sectors, have become more frequent and sophisticated.\nCritical infrastructure sectors, including financial services, increasingly have been the targets of cyberattacks, including attacks emanating from foreign countries such as the attack on the information technology company SolarWinds, which affected many Fortune 500 companies as well as U.S. government agencies. Cyberattacks involving large financial institutions, including denial of service attacks designed to disrupt external customer-facing services, nation state cyberattacks and ransomware attacks designed to deny organizations access to key internal resources or systems, and targeted social engineering and email attacks designed to allow unauthorized persons to obtain access to an institution\u2019s information systems and data or that of its customers are becoming more common and increasingly sophisticated and can be difficult to prevent. Reports of ransomware incidents specifically have increased by approximately 300% since the start of 2020 and information technology software supply chain attacks, including those involving financial institutions, also have increased during this period, some of which have resulted in temporary, but impactful, disruptions to the functioning of critical infrastructure sectors or the operations of specific financial institutions. Threat actors are increasingly seeking to target vulnerabilities in software systems used by large numbers of banking organizations to conduct malicious cyber activities. These types of attacks have resulted in increased supply chain and third-party risk. In addition, cybersecurity risks for financial institutions have evolved as a result of the use of new technologies, devices and delivery channels to transmit data and conduct financial transactions. The adoption of new products, services and delivery channels contribute to a more complex operating environment, which increases operational risk and presents the potential for additional structural vulnerabilities. In addition, the ongoing and widespread remote work environment necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic has subjected institutions to additional cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks.\nAny successful cyberattack or other security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer information or that compromises our ability to function could severely damage our reputation, erode confidence in the security of our systems, products and services, expose us to the risk of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business. Any successful cyberattack may also subject us to regulatory investigations, litigation or enforcement, or require the payment of regulatory fines or penalties or undertaking of costly remediation efforts with respect to third parties affected by a cybersecurity incident, all or any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and damage its reputation. Additionally, any failure by us to communicate cyberattacks or other security breaches appropriately to relevant parties could result in regulatory and reputational risk.\nOther potential attacks have attempted to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information or destroy data, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means. To date and to the best of our knowledge, none of these types of attacks have had a material effect on our business or operations. Such security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including persons who are involved with organized crime or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients. We are also subject to the risk that our employees may intercept and transmit unauthorized confidential or proprietary information. An interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability, remediation costs, regulatory action and reputational harm.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information provided by customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished to us by, or on behalf of, customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. In deciding whether to extend credit, we may rely upon our customers\u2019 representations that their financial statements are accurate. We also may rely on customer representations and certifications, or other audit or accountants\u2019 reports, with respect to the business and financial condition of our commercial clients. Our financial condition, results of operations, financial reporting and reputation could be materially adversely affected if we rely on materially misleading, false, inaccurate or fraudulent information.\nWe could be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions and other third parties we rely on.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional entities. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when our collateral cannot be foreclosed upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit due.\nAdherence to our internal policies and procedures by our employees is critical to our performance.\nOur internal policies and procedures are a critical component of our corporate governance and, in some cases, compliance with applicable regulations. We adopt internal policies and procedures to guide management and employees regarding the operation and conduct of our business. Any deviation or non-adherence to these internal policies and procedures, such as the conduct leading to the permanent discontinuation of the Advantage Loan Program, whether intentional or unintentional, could have a detrimental effect on our management, operations or financial condition.\nWe and our borrowers in our California communities may be adversely affected by earthquakes or other natural disasters, and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nThe majority of our branches are located in the San Francisco and Los Angeles, California areas, which in the past have experienced both severe earthquakes and wildfires. We do not carry earthquake insurance on our properties. Earthquakes, wildfires or other natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, our customers and loan collateral may be severely impacted by such events, resulting in losses.\nIf a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our branches, that damaged critical infrastructure or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time in the San Francisco and/or Los Angeles, California areas. The disaster recovery and business continuity plan that we have in place currently is limited and is unlikely to prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which, particularly when taken together with our lack of earthquake insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to environmental, social and governance risks that could adversely affect our reputation and the market price of our securities.\nWe are subject to a variety of risks arising from ESG matters. ESG matters include climate risk, hiring practices, the diversity of our work force, and racial and social justice issues involving our personnel, customers and third parties with whom we otherwise do business. Risks arising from ESG matters may adversely affect, among other things, our reputation and the market price of our securities.\nWe may be exposed to negative publicity based on the identity and activities of those to whom we lend and with which we otherwise do business and the public's view of the approach and performance of our customers and business partners with respect to ESG matters. Any such negative publicity could arise from adverse news coverage in traditional media and could also spread through the use of social media platforms.Our relationships and reputation with our existing and prospective customers and third parties with which we do business could be damaged if we were to become the subject of any such negative publicity. This, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain customers and employees and could have a negative impact on the market price for securities.\nInvestors have begun to consider the steps taken and resources allocated by financial institutions and other commercial organizations to address ESG matters when making investment and operational decisions. Certain investors are beginning to incorporate the business risks of climate change and the adequacy of companies\u2019 responses to the risks posed by climate change and other ESG matters into their investment theses. These shifts in investing priorities may result in adverse effects on the market price of our securities to the extent that investors determine that the Company has not made sufficient progress on ESG matters.\nClimate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may materially affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe current and anticipated effects of climate change are creating an increasing level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result, political and social attention to the issue of climate change has increased. In recent years, governments across the world have entered into international agreements to attempt to reduce global temperatures, in part by limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies have continued to propose and advance numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives seeking to mitigate the effects of climate change. Such initiatives have been pursued with rigor under the current Administration.\nU.S. financial regulatory authorities recently have sharpened their focus on the risks posed by climate change to the financial sector and the institutions within it. On October 21, 2021, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (\u201cFSOC\u201d), whose members include the federal banking agencies (including the OCC), published a report on climate-related financial risk. In that report the FSOC concluded, for the first time, that climate change represents an emerging and increasing threat to U.S. financial stability. Accordingly, FSOC has recommended that its member agencies accelerate their existing efforts to further assess climate-related risks to financial stability, enhance financial institutions\u2019 climate-related disclosure obligations, improve upon the availability of and access to actionable climate-related data for use in measuring and assessing climate-related financial risk, and expand upon existing capacity and expertise to ensure that climate-related financial risks are identified and managed properly. Further, on November 3, 2021, the leadership of the OCC and FRB announced their support for the Glasgow Declaration issued by the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (the \u201cNGFS\u201d), which is comprised of over 100 central banks and supervisors from across the global financial system, in which the NGFS expressed its members\u2019 commitment to improve the resilience of the financial system to climate-related and environmental risks and set forth a number of targeted workstreams to be undertaken in the coming years in order to do so.\nConsistent with the objectives outlined above, the leadership of each of the OCC, FRB and the U.S. Treasury Department has emphasized that climate-related risks are faced by banking organizations of all types and sizes, specifically including physical and transition risks; is in the process of enhancing supervisory expectations regarding banks\u2019 risk management practices; and has indicated increased expectations for larger financial institutions to measure, monitor and manage climate-related risk as part of their enterprise risk management processes. The OCC currently is engaged in multiple collaborative initiatives with other governmental authorities to assess the physical and transition risk posed by climate change and the appropriate corresponding expectations for bank risk management. The OCC also has appointed its first ever Climate Change Risk Officer to assist with these initiatives and to support the agency's efforts to enhance its supervision of climate change risk management. To that end, in December 2021, the OCC published proposed principles for climate risk management by larger banking organizations. The largest banks are being encouraged by their regulators to address the climate-related risks that they face by accounting for the effects of climate change in stress testing scenarios and systemic risk assessments, revising expectations for credit portfolio concentrations based on climate-related factors, evaluating the impact of climate change on their borrowers, considering possible changes to underwriting criteria to account for climate-related risks to mortgaged properties, incorporating climate-related financial risk into their internal reporting and monitoring and escalation processes, planning for transition risk posed by the adjustments to a low-carbon economy and investing in climate-related initiatives and lending to communities disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change. Further, the FRB has signaled that it is in the process of developing scenario analysis to model the possible financial risks associated with climate change. When developed, the resilience of large banking organizations, as well as the broader financial system, will be evaluated against these climate change-related scenarios as part of the stress testing process. Although these requirements would not apply to a banking organization of our size, our regulators generally will expect us to enhance our internal control and risk management programs and processes. To the extent that these initiatives lead to the promulgation of new regulations or supervisory guidance applicable to us, we would expect to experience increased compliance costs and other compliance-related risks.\nThe effects of climate change continue to create an alarming level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result, the global community has increased its political and social awareness surrounding the issue and have entered into international agreements in an attempt to reduce global temperatures such as the Paris Agreement, which the United States re-joined as of February 19, 2021. Further, the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies continue to propose numerous initiatives to supplement the global effort to combat climate change. Similar initiatives are expected under the Biden administration, including potentially increasing supervisory expectations with respect to banks\u2019 risk management practices, accounting for the effects of climate change in stress testing scenarios and systemic risk assessments, revising expectations for credit portfolio concentrations based on climate-related factors and encouraging investment by banks in climate-related initiatives and lending to communities disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change. Such measures may also result in the imposition of taxes and fees, the required purchase of emission credits and the implementation of significant operational changes, each of which may require the Company to upend significant capital and incur compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. The lack of empirical data surrounding the credit and other financial risks posed by climate change render it impossible to predict how specifically climate change may impact our financial condition and results of operations; however, the physical effects of climate change may also directly impact and present certain unique risks to us. Specifically, unpredictable and more frequent weather disasters may adversely impact the value of real property securing the loans in our portfolios. Further, the effects of climate change may negatively impact regional and local economic activity, which could lead to an adverse effect on our customers and impact our ability to raise and invest capital in potentially impacted communities. Overall, climate change, its effects and the resulting, unknown impact could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse conditions internationally could adversely affect our customers and business.\nMany of our customers are recent immigrants or foreign nationals. U.S. and global economic policies, military tensions, and unfavorable global economic conditions may adversely impact the economies in which our customers have family or business ties. A significant deterioration of economic conditions internationally, and in Asia in particular, could expose us to, among other things, economic and transfer risk, and we could experience an outflow of deposits by those of our customers with connections to Asia. In addition, foreign currency restrictions, particularly on the movement of cash from abroad, could adversely affect many of our customers, including with respect to their ability to make down payments or repay loans. Adverse economic conditions abroad, and in China or Taiwan in particular, may also negatively impact the profitability and liquidity of our customers with ties to these regions.\nChanges in the valuation of our securities portfolio could hurt our profits and reduce our shareholders\u2019 equity.\nOur securities portfolio may be impacted by fluctuations in market value, potentially reducing accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and/or net income. Fluctuations in market value may be caused by changes in market interest rates, lower market prices for securities and limited investor demand. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis, with more frequent evaluation for selected issues. In analyzing a debt issuer\u2019s financial condition, management may consider whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred and industry analysts\u2019 reports. In analyzing an equity issuer\u2019s financial condition, management may consider industry analysts\u2019 reports, financial performance and projected target prices of investment analysts. If this evaluation shows impairment to the actual or projected cash flows associated with one or more securities, a potential loss to net income may occur. Changes in interest rates can also have an adverse effect on our financial condition, as our available-for-sale securities are reported at their estimated fair value and therefore are impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. We increase or decrease our shareholders\u2019 equity by the amount of change in the estimated fair value of the available-for-sale securities, net of taxes. Declines in market value could result in other-than-temporary impairments of these assets, which would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels.\nThe value of our mortgage servicing rights can be volatile.\nWe sell in the secondary market residential real estate loans that we originate, which provides a meaningful portion of our non-interest income in the form of gains on the sale of mortgage loans. We also earn revenue from fees we receive for servicing mortgage loans. As a result of our mortgage servicing business, we have a portfolio of mortgage servicing rights. A mortgage servicing right is the right to service a mortgage loan-collect principal, interest, and escrow amounts-for a fee. We acquire mortgage servicing rights when we keep the servicing rights in connection with the sale of loans we have originated.\nChanges in interest rates may impact our mortgage servicing revenues, which could negatively impact our non-interest income. When rates rise, net revenue from our mortgage servicing activities can increase due to slower prepayments, which reduces our amortization expense for mortgage servicing rights. When rates fall, the value of our mortgage servicing rights usually tends to decline as a result of a higher volume of prepayments, resulting in a decline in our net revenue. It is possible that, because of economic conditions and/or a weak or deteriorating housing market, even if interest rates were to fall or remain low, mortgage originations may also fall or any increase in mortgage originations may not be enough to offset the decrease in the mortgage servicing rights value caused by the lower rates. Because the value of our mortgage servicing rights is recorded on our balance sheet and evaluated on a quarterly basis, any significant decline in value could adversely affect our income, our capital ratios or require us to raise additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms.\nOur critical accounting policies and estimates, risk management processes and controls rely on analytical and forecasting techniques and models, management judgments and assumptions about matters that are uncertain and may not accurately predict future events.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods, so they comply with U.S. GAAP and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner in which to report our financial condition and results. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet which may result in our reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nCertain accounting policies are critical to presenting our financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. These critical accounting policies include the allowance for loan losses, the fair value of financial instruments and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights. Because of the uncertainty of estimates involved in these matters, we may be required to significantly increase the allowance for loan losses or sustain loan losses that are significantly higher than the reserve provided or reduce the carrying value of an asset measured at fair value. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur internal controls, disclosure controls, processes and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures are based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable (not absolute) assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls, processes and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls, processes and procedures could necessitate changes in those controls, processes and procedures, which may increase our compliance costs, divert management attention from our business or subject us to regulatory actions and increased regulatory scrutiny. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Governance Matters\nThe Seligman family, directly and through the family\u2019s trusts, has influenced and has the ability to continue to influence Company operations and to control the outcome of matters submitted for shareholder approval and may have interests that differ from those of our other shareholders.\nScott J. Seligman and others of his family were the original founders of the Bank, and Mr. Seligman has had a variety of senior roles and positions over the course of many years. Prior to 2000, he served as a member of the Bank\u2019s board and as chief executive officer of the Bank. After 2000 and through December 31, 2019, he served as a consulting director to the board of the Bank and retained the title of vice president of the Company. In these roles, Mr. Seligman participated in the conduct of the affairs of the Bank and had a significant influence over the Bank\u2019s operations. In addition, Mr. Seligman caused the Bank to engage in various transactions with other Seligman-controlled businesses. For example, the Bank has a sublease agreement with one such business, Seligman & Associates, for office space, and, until October 31, 2020, the Bank provided monthly data processing and programming services to entities controlled by the Company\u2019s controlling shareholders. Mr. Seligman resigned from his positions as consulting director to the board of the Bank and as vice president of the Company effective December 31, 2019.\nPrior to August 2020, more than 50% of our outstanding voting power was held by the same trustee utilized by Scott J. Seligman and Sandra Seligman for their respective family trusts. Due to a change in the trustee for certain of those trusts established by Sandra Seligman, effective as of August 19, 2020, no one trustee has voting and dispositive power over more than 50% of our voting stock. Accordingly, trustees of the trusts for the benefit of Scott J. Seligman have voting and dispositive power over approximately 48% of our common stock, effectively giving such trusts control over the outcome of the shareholder votes on most matters. The trustee of the trusts created by Sandra Seligman has voting and dispositive power over approximately 18% of our common stock, and Seth Meltzer has voting and dispositive power, individually or through trust, over approximately 3% of our common stock. Minority stockholders, therefore, cannot decide the outcome of a stockholder vote without the support of any of Scott J. Seligman, Sandra Seligman, and/or Seth Meltzer.\nCertain provisions of our corporate governance documents and Michigan law could discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.\nOur second amended and restated articles of incorporation contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our Company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. These include provisions that, among other things:\n\u25cf permit the board to issue up to 10 million shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as they may determine (including the right to approve an acquisition or other change in control);\n\u25cf provide that the authorized number of directors may be fixed only by the board in accordance with our amended and restated bylaws;\n\u25cf do not provide for cumulative voting rights (therefore allowing the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election);\n\u25cf divide our board into three staggered classes;\n\u25cf provide that all vacancies and newly created directorships may be filled by the affirmative vote of at least 80% of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n\u25cf prohibit removal of directors without cause;\n\u25cf prohibit shareholders from calling special meetings of shareholders;\n\u25cf require unanimous consent for shareholders to take action by written consent without approval of the action by our board;\n\u25cf provide that shareholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of shareholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of shareholders must provide advance notice in writing and also comply with specified requirements related to the form and content of a shareholder\u2019s notice;\n\u25cf require at least 80% supermajority shareholder approval to alter, amend or repeal certain provisions of our second amended and restated articles of incorporation; and\n\u25cf require at least 80% supermajority shareholder approval in order for shareholders to adopt, amend or repeal our amended and restated bylaws.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for shareholders to replace members of the board of directors, which is responsible for appointing members of our management. Any matters requiring the approval of our shareholders will require the approval of the Seligman family and their trustees, which may have interests that differ from those of our other shareholders.\nIn addition, the 2017 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan and the 2020 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan each provide that restricted stock awards become fully vested in the event of a change in control and permit the board of directors or a committee thereof to accelerate, vest or cause the restrictions to lapse with respect to other outstanding awards including stock options, in the event of, or immediately prior to, a change in control. Such vesting or acceleration could discourage the acquisition of our Company.\nWe could also become subject to certain anti-takeover provisions under Michigan law which may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us, whether or not an acquisition or merger is desired by or beneficial to our shareholders. If a corporation\u2019s board of directors chooses to opt-in to certain provisions of Michigan Law, such corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting shares unless the holder has held the shares for five years or more or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the business combination. Our board of directors has not elected to be subject to this provision but could do so in the future. Any provision of our second amended and restated articles of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or Michigan law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our shareholders to receive a premium for their shares and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock otherwise.\nThe exclusive forum provision in our second amended and restated articles of incorporation could limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur second amended and restated articles of incorporation provides that the courts of the State of Michigan located in Oakland County and the U.S. District for the Eastern District of Michigan shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any derivative action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or employees to us or our shareholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Michigan Business Corporation Act (as it may be amended from time to time), or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us governed by the State of Michigan\u2019s internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of our second amended and restated articles of incorporation described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our second amended and restated articles of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ability to pay dividends is restricted by applicable law and regulations and the terms of our subordinated notes and depends on the success of both Sterling Bancorp, Inc. and the Bank.\nOur ability to pay cash dividends is restricted by the terms of our subordinated notes as well as applicable provisions of Michigan law and the rules and regulations of the OCC and the FRB. Under the terms of the subordinated notes, as long as the subordinated notes are outstanding, the Company is permitted to pay dividends if prior to such dividends, the Bank is considered well capitalized under applicable regulatory capital requirements. In addition, under Michigan law, Sterling Bancorp, Inc. is prohibited from paying cash dividends if, after giving effect to the dividend, (i) it would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or (ii) its total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders with preferential rights on dissolution that are superior to those receiving the dividend, and we are currently required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB in order to pay any dividends to our shareholders.\nSterling Bancorp, Inc. is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank that receives substantially all of its revenue through the Bank. Dividends from the Bank are the principal source of funds used by Sterling Bancorp, Inc. to pay cash dividends and interest on our subordinated notes. Any future determination to pay dividends to holders of our common stock will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, banking regulations and contractual restrictions, at both Sterling Bancorp, Inc. and the Bank and on a consolidated basis, and any other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant, and we can provide no assurance that we will pay any dividends to our shareholders in the future. The Bank is currently required to obtain the prior approval of the OCC in order to pay dividends to the Company due to the existence of the OCC Agreement.", "PERMNO": 17121, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "SBT"}
