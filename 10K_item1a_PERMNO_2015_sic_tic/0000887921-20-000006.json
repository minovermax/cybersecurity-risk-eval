Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information in this report, investors should consider carefully the following risk factors when evaluating the Company\u2019s business. For definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this Form 10-K referring to the Company's debt facilities, see Part II, Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Long-Term Debt Instruments\" of this 2019 Form 10-K.\nRevlon is a holding company with no business operations of its own and is dependent on its subsidiaries to pay certain expenses and dividends. In addition, shares of the capital stock of Products Corporation, Revlon's wholly-owned operating subsidiary, are pledged by Revlon to secure its obligations under the 2016 Credit Agreements and the 2019 Term Loan Facility.\nRevlon is a holding company with no business operations of its own. Revlon's only material asset is all of the outstanding capital stock of Products Corporation, Revlon's wholly-owned operating subsidiary, through which Revlon conducts its business operations. As such, Revlon's net income has historically consisted predominantly of its equity in the net loss of Products Corporation, which for 2019 and 2018 was $151.2 million and $289.1 million, respectively (in each case excluding $7.9 million and $6.3 million, respectively, in expenses primarily related to Revlon being a public holding company). Revlon is dependent on the earnings and cash flow of, and dividends and distributions from, Products Corporation to pay Revlon\u2019s expenses incidental to being a public holding company and to pay any cash dividend or distribution on its Class A Common Stock in each case that may be authorized by Revlon\u2019s Board of Directors.\nProducts Corporation may not generate sufficient cash flow to pay dividends or distribute funds to Revlon because, for example, Products Corporation may not generate sufficient cash or net income; state laws may restrict or prohibit Products Corporation from issuing dividends or making distributions unless Products Corporation has sufficient surplus or net profits, which Products Corporation may not have; or because contractual restrictions, including negative covenants contained in Products Corporation\u2019s various debt instruments, may prohibit or limit such dividends or distributions.\nThe terms of Products Corporation's 2016 Credit Agreements, the indentures governing Products Corporation's 6.25% Senior Notes due 2024 (the \"6.25% Senior Notes Indenture\" and the \"6.25% Senior Notes,\" respectively) and 5.75% Senior Notes due 2021 (the \"5.75% Senior Notes Indenture\" and the \"5.75% Senior Notes,\" respectively, and, together with the 6.25% Senior Notes Indenture, the \"Senior Notes Indentures\" and the \"Senior Notes,\" respectively) and the 2019 Term Loan Facility (as hereinafter defined) generally restrict Products Corporation from paying dividends or making distributions to Revlon, except in limited circumstances. For example, Products Corporation is permitted to pay dividends and make distributions to Revlon to enable Revlon to, among other things, maintain its existence and its ownership of Products Corporation, such as paying professional fees (e.g., legal, accounting and insurance fees), regulatory fees (e.g., SEC filing fees and NYSE listing fees), pay certain taxes and other expenses related to being a public holding company and, subject to certain limitations, to pay dividends, if any, on Revlon\u2019s outstanding securities or make distributions in certain circumstances to finance Revlon\u2019s purchase of shares of its Class A Common Stock issued in connection with the delivery of such shares to grantees under the Fourth Amended and Restated Revlon, Inc. Stock Plan, as amended. These limitations therefore restrict Revlon's ability to pay dividends on its Class A Common Stock.\nAll of the shares of Products Corporation\u2019s capital stock held by Revlon are pledged to secure Revlon\u2019s guarantee of Products Corporation's obligations under its 2016 Credit Agreements and the 2019 Term Loan Facility. A foreclosure upon the shares of Products Corporation's common stock would result in Revlon no longer holding its only material asset, would have a material adverse effect on the holders and price of Revlon\u2019s Class A Common Stock and would be a change of control under Products Corporation\u2019s other debt instruments. (See also Item 1A. Risk Factors - \"Shares of Revlon Class A Common Stock and Products Corporation's capital stock are pledged to secure various of Revlon's and/or other of the Company's affiliates\u2019 obligations and foreclosure upon these shares or dispositions of shares could result in the acceleration of debt under Products Corporation's 2016 Senior Credit Facilities, 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility, 2019 Term Loan Facility, Amended 2019 Senior Line of Credit Facility and/or its Senior Notes and could have other consequences.\")\nREVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nProducts Corporation\u2019s substantial indebtedness could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and flexibility and Products Corporation\u2019s ability to service its debt.\nProducts Corporation has a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019 the Company\u2019s total indebtedness was $3,252.8 million (or $3,196.4 million net of discounts and debt issuance costs), including: (i) $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% Senior Notes; (ii) $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.75% Senior Notes; (iii) $230.9 million of secured indebtedness under Tranche A of its Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility; (iv) $41.5 million of secured indebtedness under Tranche B of its Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility; (v) $1,741.5 million in aggregate principal amount of secured indebtedness under its 2016 Term Loan Facility; (vi) $86.3 million in aggregate principal amount of secured indebtedness under its 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility (as hereinafter defined); (vii) $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of secured indebtedness under its 2019 Term Loan Facility; (viii) nil in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under its Amended 2019 Senior Line of Credit Facility (as hereinafter defined); and (ix) $2.6 million in aggregate principal amount of other indebtedness. In addition, as of such date Products Corporation would have had the ability to incur an additional $157.7 million of secured indebtedness under its Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and $30.0 million in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under its Amended 2019 Senior Line of Credit Facility. If the Company is unable to maintain or increase its profitability and cash flow and sustain such results in future periods, it could adversely affect the Company's operations and Products Corporation's ability to service its debt and/or comply with the financial and/or operating covenants under its various debt instruments. (See also Item 1A. Risk Factors - \"Restrictions and covenants in Products Corporation\u2019s various debt instruments limit its ability to take certain actions and impose consequences in the event of failure to comply.\")\nThe Company is subject to the risks normally associated with substantial indebtedness, including the risk that the Company\u2019s profitability and cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest under Products Corporation\u2019s various debt instruments, and the risk that Products Corporation will be unable to refinance existing indebtedness when it becomes due or, if it is unable to comply with the financial or operating covenants under its various debt instruments, to obtain any necessary consents, waivers or amendments or that the terms of any such refinancing and/or consents, waivers or amendments will be less favorable than the current terms of such indebtedness. Products Corporation\u2019s substantial indebtedness could also have the effect of:\n\u2022limiting the Company\u2019s ability to fund (including by obtaining additional financing) the costs and expenses of executing the Company\u2019s business initiatives, future working capital, capital expenditures, advertising, promotional and/or marketing expenses, new product development costs, purchases and reconfigurations of wall displays, acquisitions, and related integration costs, investments, restructuring programs and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022requiring the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on Products Corporation\u2019s indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of the Company\u2019s cash flow necessary for executing the Company\u2019s business initiatives and for other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022placing the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022exposing the Company to potential events of default (if not cured or waived) under the financial and operating covenants contained in Products Corporation\u2019s various debt instruments;\n\u2022limiting the Company\u2019s flexibility in responding to changes in its business and the industry in which it operates; and\n\u2022making the Company more vulnerable in the event of adverse economic conditions or a downturn in its business.\nAlthough agreements governing Products Corporation\u2019s indebtedness, including the 2016 Credit Agreements, the Senior Notes Indentures and the 2019 Term Loan Agreement (as hereinafter defined), limit Products Corporation\u2019s ability to borrow funds, under certain circumstances Products Corporation is allowed to borrow a significant amount of additional money, some of which, in certain circumstances and subject to certain limitations, could be secured indebtedness. To the extent that more debt, whether secured or unsecured, is added to the Company's current debt levels, the risks described above would increase further. See \u201cRecent Developments - 2020 Refinancing Transactions\u201d in Item 7. \u201cCombined Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nREVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nProducts Corporation\u2019s ability to pay the principal amount of its indebtedness depends on many factors.\nTranche B under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility matures no later than April 2020; the Amended 2019 Senior Line of Credit Facility matures on December 31, 2020; the 5.75% Senior Notes mature in February 2021; the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility matures in July 2021; Tranche A under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility matures no later than September 2021; the 2019 Term Loan Facility matures no later than August 2023; the 2016 Term Loan Facility matures no later than September 2023; and the 6.25% Senior Notes mature in August 2024. Also, while the 2019 Term Loan Facility is scheduled to mature no later than August 2023, its maturity would accelerate to the earliest of: (y) the 180th day prior to the maturity of Products Corporation\u2019s existing 2016 Term Loan Facility, if any loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility remain outstanding and have not been replaced or refinanced by such date; and (z) the date of any springing maturity of the 2016 Term Loan Facility (i.e., the 91st day prior to the maturity of the 5.75% Senior Notes due February 15, 2021 if any 5.75% Senior Notes remain outstanding by such date). Tranche A of the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility has a springing maturity similar to the 2016 Term Loan Facility. For a more complete description of the maturities of these debt instruments, including events that could accelerate their respective maturities, see Note 9, \u201cDebt\u201d to the Company's Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this 2019 Form 10-K. See also, \u201cRecent Developments - 2020 Refinancing Transactions\u201d in Item 7. \u201cCombined Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d Products Corporation currently anticipates that, in order to pay the principal amount of its outstanding indebtedness upon the occurrence of any event of default, or to repurchase any of the Senior Notes if a change of control occurs, or in the event that Products Corporation\u2019s cash flows from operations are insufficient to allow it to pay the principal amount of its indebtedness by their respective maturity dates, the Company will be required to refinance some or all of Products Corporation\u2019s indebtedness, seek to sell assets or operations, seek to sell additional Revlon equity, seek to sell debt securities of Revlon or Products Corporation and/or seek additional capital contributions or loans from MacAndrews & Forbes or from the Company\u2019s other affiliates and/or third parties. The Company may be unable to take any of these actions due to a variety of commercial or market factors or constraints in Products Corporation\u2019s various debt instruments, including, for example, market conditions being unfavorable for an equity or debt issuance, additional capital contributions or loans not being available from affiliates and/or third parties, or that the transactions may not be permitted under the terms of Products Corporation\u2019s various debt instruments then in effect, including restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, incurrence of liens, asset dispositions and/or related party transactions included in such debt instruments. Such actions, if ever taken, may not enable the Company to satisfy its cash requirements if the actions do not result in sufficient cost reductions or generate a sufficient amount of additional capital, as the case may be.\nNone of the Company\u2019s affiliates are required to make any capital contributions, loans or other payments to Products Corporation regarding its obligations on its indebtedness, other than the Amended 2019 Senior Line of Credit Facility. Products Corporation may not be able to pay the principal amount of its indebtedness using any of the above actions because, under certain circumstances, the 2016 Credit Agreements, the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Agreement, the 2019 Term Loan Agreement, the Senior Notes Indentures, any of Products Corporation's other debt instruments and/or the debt instruments of Products Corporation\u2019s subsidiaries then in effect may not permit the Company to take such actions. (See also Item 1A. Risk Factors - \"Restrictions and covenants in Products Corporation\u2019s various debt instruments limit its ability to take certain actions and impose consequences in the event of failure to comply\").\nThe future state of the credit markets, including any volatility and/or tightening of the credit markets and reduction in credit availability, could adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to refinance or replace, in whole or in part, Products Corporation\u2019s outstanding indebtedness by their respective maturity dates, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nRestrictions and covenants in Products Corporation\u2019s various debt instruments limit its ability to take certain actions and impose consequences in the event of failure to comply.\nThe agreements that govern Products Corporation's indebtedness, including the 2016 Credit Agreements, the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Agreement, the 2019 Term Loan Agreement and Products Corporation's Senior Notes Indentures, contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit Products Corporation\u2019s ability (subject in each case to certain exceptions) to, among other things:\n\u2022borrow money;\n\u2022use assets as security in other borrowings or transactions;\n\u2022pay dividends on stock or purchase stock;\n\u2022sell assets and use the proceeds from such sales;\n\u2022enter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022make certain investments;\nREVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\u2022prepay, redeem or repurchase specified indebtedness; and\n\u2022permit restrictions on the payment of dividends to Products Corporation by its subsidiaries.\nThese covenants affect Products Corporation\u2019s operating flexibility by, among other things, restricting its ability to incur indebtedness that could be used to fund the costs of executing the Company\u2019s business initiatives and to grow the Company\u2019s business, as well as to fund general corporate purposes.\nCertain breaches under the 2016 Credit Agreements, the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Agreement, the 2019 Term Loan Agreement, the Amended 2019 Senior Line of Credit Agreement and/or the Senior Notes Indentures would permit the Company\u2019s lenders to accelerate amounts outstanding thereunder. The acceleration of amounts outstanding under the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities, the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility, the 2019 Term Loan Facility, the Amended 2019 Senior Line of Credit Facility and/or the Senior Notes would in certain circumstances constitute an event of default under the other instruments permitting amounts outstanding under such instruments to be accelerated. See \u201cRecent Developments - 2020 Refinancing Transactions\u201d in Item 7. \u201cCombined Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d In addition, holders of the Senior Notes may require Products Corporation to repurchase their notes in the event of a change of control under the applicable indenture and a change of control would be an event of default under the 2016 Credit Agreements, the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Agreement and the 2019 Term Loan Agreement. Products Corporation may not have sufficient funds at the time of any such breach or change of control to repay, in full or in part, amounts outstanding under the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities, the 2019 Term Loan Facility, the Amended 2019 Senior Line of Credit Facility or the 2018 Asset-Based Term Facility or to repay, repurchase or redeem, in full or in part, the Senior Notes.\nEvents beyond the Company\u2019s control could impair the Company\u2019s operating performance, which could affect Products Corporation\u2019s ability to comply with the terms of Products Corporation\u2019s debt instruments. Such events may include decreased consumer spending in response to weak economic conditions or weakness in the consumption of beauty products in one or more of the Company's segments; adverse changes in tariffs, foreign currency exchange rates, foreign currency controls and/or government-mandated pricing controls; decreased sales of the Company's products as a result of increased competitive activities by the Company\u2019s competitors and/or decreased performance by third-party suppliers, whether due to shortages of raw materials or otherwise; changes in consumer purchasing habits, including with respect to retailer preferences and/or among sales channels, such as due to any further consumption declines that the Company has experienced; inventory management by the Company's customers; inventory de-stocking by certain retail customers; space reconfigurations or reductions in display space by the Company's customers; retail store closures in the brick-and-mortar channels where the Company sells its products, as consumers continue to shift purchases to online and e-commerce channels; changes in pricing, marketing, advertising and/or promotional strategies by the Company's customers; less than anticipated results from the Company's existing or new products or from its advertising, promotional, pricing and/or marketing plans; or if the Company\u2019s expenses, including, without limitation, those for pension expense under its benefit plans, restructuring programs and related severance expenses, acquisitions and related integration costs, capital expenditures, costs related to litigation, advertising, promotional and/or marketing activities or for sales returns related to any reduction of space by the Company's customers, product discontinuances or otherwise, exceed the Company's anticipated level of expenses.\nUnder such circumstances, Products Corporation may be unable to comply with the requirements of one or more of its various debt instruments, including any financial covenants in the 2016 Credit Agreements and the 2019 Term Loan Agreement. If Products Corporation is unable to satisfy such requirements at any future time, Products Corporation would need to seek an amendment or waiver of such requirements. The respective lenders under the 2016 Credit Agreements and/or the 2019 Term Loan Agreement may not consent to any amendment or waiver requests that Products Corporation may make in the future, and, if they do consent, they may only do so on terms that are unfavorable to Products Corporation and/or Revlon.\nIf Products Corporation is unable to obtain any such waiver or amendment, Products Corporation's inability to meet the requirements of the 2016 Credit Agreements and/or the 2019 Term Loan Agreement would constitute an event of default under such agreements, which, under certain circumstances, would permit the bank lenders to accelerate the repayment of the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities and the 2019 Term Loan Facility, and, under certain circumstances, would constitute an event of default under the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Agreement, the Amended 2019 Senior Line of Credit Agreement and the Senior Notes Indentures. An event of default under the Senior Notes Indentures would permit the respective Notes Trustee or the Requisite Note Holders to accelerate payment of the principal and accrued, but unpaid, interest on the respective Senior Notes. An event of default under the Amended 2019 Senior Line of Credit Agreement, under certain circumstances, would permit the lenders to accelerate the repayment of such facility.\nREVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nProducts Corporation\u2019s assets and/or cash flows and/or that of Products Corporation\u2019s subsidiaries may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under its various debt instruments, either upon maturity or if accelerated upon an event of default or change of control, and if the Company is required to repay, repurchase and/or redeem, in whole or in part, amounts outstanding under its 2016 Senior Credit Facilities, the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility, 2019 Term Loan Facility, Amended 2019 Senior Line of Credit Facility and/or its Senior Notes, it may be unable to refinance or restructure the payments on such debt. See \u201cRecent Developments - 2020 Refinancing Transactions\u201d in Item 7. \u201cCombined Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d Further, if the Company is unable to repay, refinance or restructure its indebtedness under the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities, the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility and/or the 2019 Term Loan Facility, the lenders could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness, subject to certain conditions and limitations as set forth in the related intercreditor agreements and collateral agreements. As described above, the consequences of complying with the foregoing restrictions, covenants and limitations under the Company\u2019s various debt instruments could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nLimits on Products Corporation's borrowing capacity under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility may affect the Company's ability to finance its operations.\nAt December 31, 2019, Products Corporation had $272.4 million in aggregate borrowings outstanding under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and $86.3 million outstanding under the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility. While the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility provides for up to $441.5 million of commitments, the Company\u2019s ability to borrow funds under such facility is limited by a borrowing base determined relative to the value, from time-to-time, of certain eligible assets.\nWhile the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility provides for a euro-denominated senior secured asset-based term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of \u20ac77 million, the full amount of which was funded on the closing of the facility in July 2018, the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Agreement requires the maintenance of a borrowing base supporting the borrowing thereunder, based on the sum of: (i) 85% of eligible accounts receivable; and (ii) 90% of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory, in each case with respect to certain of Products Corporation\u2019s subsidiaries organized in Australia, Bermuda, Germany, Italy, Spain and Switzerland, subject to certain customary availability reserves.\nUnder the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility, if the value of the Company's eligible assets is not sufficient to support the full borrowing base under the respective facility, Products Corporation will not have complete access to the entire commitment available under such facilities, but rather would have access to a lesser amount as determined by the borrowing base.\nThe Borrowers must prepay loans under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility to the extent that outstanding loans exceed its respective borrowing base Under the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility, in lieu of a mandatory prepayment, the Loan Parties may deposit cash in an amount not to exceed 10% of the borrowing base into a designated U.S. bank account with the Agent that is subject to a control agreement (such cash, the \"Qualified Cash\"). If any such over-advance has not been cured within 60 days, the Qualified Cash may be applied, at the Agent\u2019s option, to prepay the loans under the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility. To the extent certain levels of availability are obtained during a certain period of time, the Borrowers can withdraw the Qualified Cash from such bank account. In addition, the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility is subject to mandatory prepayments from the net proceeds from the incurrence by the Loan Parties of debt not permitted thereunder.\nAs Products Corporation continues to manage its working capital (including its and its subsidiaries inventory and accounts receivable, which are significant components of the eligible assets comprising the borrowing base under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility), this could reduce the borrowing base under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and/or the 2018 Asset-Based Term Facility. Further, if Products Corporation borrows funds under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, subsequent changes in the value or eligibility of the assets within the borrowing base could require Products Corporation to pay down amounts outstanding under such facility so that there is no amount outstanding in excess of the then-existing borrowing base. Likewise, subsequent changes in the value or eligibility of the assets within the borrowing base under the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility could require Products Corporation to pay down amounts outstanding under such facility so that there is no amount outstanding in excess of the then-existing borrowing base, which, unlike the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, cannot be re-borrowed.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to borrow under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility is also conditioned upon its compliance with other covenants in the agreements that govern the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities. Because of these limitations, the Company may not always be able to meet its cash requirements with funds borrowed under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nREVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIf one or more lenders under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility are unable to fulfill their commitment to advance funds to Products Corporation under such facility, it would impact the Company\u2019s liquidity and, depending upon the amount involved and the Company\u2019s liquidity requirements, it could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to fund its operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company had a liquidity position of $278.7 million, consisting of: (i) $104.3 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents; (ii) $157.7 million in available borrowing capacity under Products Corporation's Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility (which had $272.4 million drawn at such date); (iii) $30 million in available borrowing capacity under the Amended 2019 Senior Line of Credit Facility, which had no borrowings at such date; and less (iv) $13.3 million of outstanding checks. See \u201cRecent Developments - 2020 Refinancing Transactions\u201d in Item 7. \u201cCombined Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nA substantial portion of Products Corporation's indebtedness is subject to floating interest rates and the potential discontinuation or replacement of LIBOR could result in an increase to our interest expense.\nA substantial portion of the Products Corporation's indebtedness is subject to floating interest rates, which makes the Company more vulnerable in the event of adverse economic conditions, increases in prevailing interest rates or a downturn in the Company\u2019s business. As of December 31, 2019, $2,253.6 million of Products Corporation\u2019s total indebtedness, or approximately 71% of its total indebtedness, was subject to floating interest rates.\nIn July 2017, the U.K.\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. It is unclear whether or not LIBOR will cease to exist at that time (and if so, what reference rate will replace it) or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. Certain of Products Corporation\u2019s financing agreements, including its 2016 Term Loan Facility, the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2019 Term Loan Facility are made at variable rates that use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate. While the 2016 Credit Agreements contain limited \u201cfallback\u201d provisions providing for comparable or successor rates in the event LIBOR is unavailable, these provisions may not adequately address the actual changes to LIBOR or its successor rates. For example, if future rates based upon the successor reference rate (or a new method of calculating LIBOR) are higher than LIBOR rates as currently determined, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. On the other hand, if future rates based upon the successor reference rate (or a new method of calculating LIBOR) are lower than LIBOR rates as currently determined, the lenders under such credit agreements may seek amendments to increase the applicable interest rate margins or invoke their right to require the use of the alternate base rate in place of LIBOR, which could result in an increase to our interest expense as discussed below. By contrast, the 2019 Term Loan Facility does not have provisions for selecting or requiring the alternative base rate, and therefore in the event that LIBOR is discontinued in the future and a comparable or successor rate is not approved by the required lenders under the 2019 Term Loan Facility, it may become necessary to amend the 2019 Term Loan Facility. More generally, a phase-out of LIBOR could cause market volatility or disruption and may adversely affect our access to the capital markets and cost of funding, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nSimilar considerations as the ones described above with respect to LIBOR as benchmark for establishing interest rates apply to EURIBOR. Our 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility is denominated in Euros and the interest rate thereunder is tied to EURIBOR. To the extent that EURIBOR becomes unavailable, the agreement contains fallback provisions ultimately providing for a rate determined by the administrative agent as the all-in-cost of funds for borrowings denominated in Euros with maturities comparable to the interest period applicable to the loans under the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility.\nREVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nAs of December 31, 2019, the entire $1,741.5 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2016 Term Loan Facility bore interest, at Product Corporation\u2019s option, at a rate per annum of LIBOR (which has a floor of 0.75%) plus a margin of 3.5% or an alternate base rate plus a margin of 2.5%, payable quarterly, at a minimum. At December 31, 2019, LIBOR and the alternate base rate for the 2016 Term Loan Facility were 4.75% and 1.908%, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, $230.9 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding under Tranche A of the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility bore interest, at Products Corporation\u2019s option, at a rate per annum equal to either: (i) the alternate base rate plus an applicable margin equal to 0.25%, 0.50% or 0.75%, depending on the average excess availability (based on the borrowing base as most recently reported by Products Corporation to the administrative agent from time-to-time); or (ii) the Eurocurrency rate plus an applicable margin equal to 1.25%, 1.5% or 1.75%, depending on the average excess availability (based on the borrowing base as most recently reported by Products Corporation to the administrative agent from time-to-time). As of December 31, 2019, $41.5 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding under Tranche B of the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility bore interest, at Products Corporation\u2019s option, at a rate per annum equal to either: (i) the alternate base rate plus an applicable margin equal to 1.5%, 1.75% or 2.0%, depending on the average excess availability (based on the borrowing base as most recently reported by Products Corporation to the administrative agent from time-to-time); or (ii) the Eurocurrency rate plus an applicable margin equal to 2.5%, 2.75% or 3.0%, depending on the average excess availability (based on the borrowing base as most recently reported by Products Corporation to the administrative agent from time-to-time). Under Tranches A and B of the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, the applicable margin increases as average excess availability thereunder decreases. Under the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility, which had $86.3 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding as of December 31, 2019, interest accrues on borrowings at a rate per annum equal to the EURIBOR rate plus a 6.50% applicable margin. Interest accrues on the 2019 Term Loan Facility, which had $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding as of December 31, 2019, at a rate per annum of one-month adjusted LIBOR (which has a floor of 0%), plus a margin of 9.50%.\nIf any of LIBOR (or its successor rate), the prime rate or the federal funds effective rate increases, Products Corporation\u2019s debt service costs will increase to the extent that Products Corporation has elected such rates for its outstanding loans. Based on the amounts outstanding under the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities, the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility, the 2019 Term Loan Facility and other short-term borrowings (which, in the aggregate, are Products Corporation\u2019s only debt currently subject to floating interest rates) as of December 31, 2019, a 1% increase in LIBOR (or an equivalent successor rate) would increase the Company\u2019s annual interest expense by $21.4 million. Based on the same amounts outstanding, a change from LIBOR to the alternate base rate in the case of the 2016 Credit Agreements would increase the Company\u2019s annual interest expense by $37.7 million. Increased debt service costs would adversely affect the Company\u2019s cash flows and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe Company's ability to service its debt and meet its cash requirements depends on many factors, including achieving anticipated levels of revenue and expenses. If such revenue or expense levels prove to be other than as anticipated, the Company may be unable to meet its cash requirements or Products Corporation may be unable to meet the requirements of the 2016 Credit Agreements, 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Loan Agreement, 2019 Term Loan Agreement and/or Amended 2019 Senior Line of Credit Agreement, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe Company currently expects that operating revenues, cash on hand, and funds that may be available for borrowing under the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, the Amended 2019 Senior Line of Credit Facility, the 2020 Refinancing Transactions and other permissible borrowings will be sufficient to enable the Company to cover its operating expenses for 2020, including: cash requirements for the payment of expenses in connection with executing the Company's business initiatives and its advertising, promotional, pricing and/or marketing plans; purchases of permanent wall displays; capital expenditure requirements; debt service payments and costs; cash tax payments; pension and other post-retirement plan contributions; payments in connection with the Company's restructuring programs (including, without limitation, the EA Integration Restructuring Program, the 2018 Optimization Program and the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program); severance not otherwise included in the Company's restructuring programs; business and/or brand acquisitions (including, without limitation, through licensing transactions), if any; debt and/or equity repurchases, if any; costs related to litigation; and payments in connection with discontinuing non-core business lines and/or exiting and/or entering certain territories and/or channels of trade.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nHowever, if the Company's anticipated level of revenue is not achieved because of, for example, decreased consumer spending in response to weak economic conditions or weakness in the consumption of beauty products in one or more of the Company's segments; adverse changes in tariffs, foreign currency exchange rates, foreign currency controls and/or government-mandated pricing controls; decreased sales of the Company's products as a result of increased competitive activities by the Company's competitors and/or decreased performance by third-party suppliers, whether due to shortages of raw materials or otherwise; changes in consumer purchasing habits, including with respect to retailer preferences and/or sales channels, such as due to the consumption declines in core beauty categories in the mass retail channel in North America, which continues to have a negative impact on net sales of Revlon color cosmetics and SinfulColors color cosmetics; inventory management by the Company's customers; space reconfigurations or reductions in display space by the Company's customers; retail store closures in brick-and-mortar channels where the Company sells its products, as consumers continue to shift purchases to online and e-commerce channels; changes in pricing, marketing, advertising and/or promotional strategies by the Company's customers; less than anticipated results from the Company's existing or new products or from its advertising, promotional, pricing and/or marketing plans; or if the Company's expenses, including, without limitation, those for pension expense under its benefit plans, capital expenditures, restructuring and severance costs (including, without limitation, for the EA Integration Restructuring Program, the 2018 Optimization Program and the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program), acquisition and integration costs, costs related to litigation, advertising, promotional or marketing activities or for sales returns related to any reduction of space by the Company's customers, product discontinuances or otherwise, exceed the anticipated level of expenses, the Company's current sources of funds may be insufficient to meet its cash requirements. In addition, such developments, if significant, could reduce the Company's revenues and could have a material adverse effect on Products Corporation's ability to comply with the terms of the 2016 Credit Agreements, 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Loan Agreement, 2019 Term Loan Agreement and/or Amended 2019 Senior Line of Credit Agreement (See also Item 1A. Risk Factors - \"Restrictions and covenants in Products Corporation\u2019s various debt instruments limit its ability to take certain actions and impose consequences in the event of failure to comply,\" which discusses, among other things, the consequences of noncompliance with Products Corporation's debt covenants).\nIf the Company's operating revenues, cash on hand and/or funds that may be available for borrowing are insufficient to cover the Company's expenses and/or are insufficient to enable Products Corporation to comply with the requirements of the 2016 Credit Agreements, 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Loan Agreement, 2019 Term Loan Agreement and/or Amended 2019 Senior Line of Credit Agreement, the Company could be required to adopt one or more of the alternatives listed below:\n\u2022delaying the implementation of or revising certain aspects of the Company's business initiatives;\n\u2022reducing or delaying purchases of wall displays and/or expenses related to the Company's advertising, promotional and/or marketing activities;\n\u2022reducing or delaying capital spending;\n\u2022implementing new restructuring programs;\n\u2022refinancing Products Corporation's indebtedness;\n\u2022selling assets or operations;\n\u2022seeking additional capital contributions and/or loans from MacAndrews & Forbes, the Company's other affiliates and/or third parties;\n\u2022selling additional Revlon equity or debt securities or Products Corporation's debt securities; and/or\n\u2022reducing other discretionary spending.\nThe Company may not be able to take any of these actions because of a variety of commercial or market factors or constraints in one or more of Products Corporation's various debt instruments, including, for example, market conditions being unfavorable for an equity or a debt issuance, additional capital contributions or loans not being available from affiliates and/or third parties, or that the transactions may not be permitted under the terms of one or more of Products Corporation's various debt instruments then in effect, such as due to restrictions on the incurrence of debt, incurrence of liens, asset dispositions and/or related party transactions. If the Company is required to take any of these actions, it could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nSuch actions, if ever taken, may not enable the Company to satisfy its cash requirements or enable Products Corporation to comply with the terms of the 2016 Credit Agreements, 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Loan Agreement and/or 2019 Term Loan Agreement if the actions do not result in sufficient cost reductions or generate a sufficient amount of additional capital, as the case may be.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIf the Company is unable to consummate its committed financing, or otherwise obtain sufficient alternative funding, for the repayment in full of its 5.75% Senior Notes due 2021, certain of its credit facilities will be subject to an Accelerated Maturity Event which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe 5.75% Senior Notes are due on February 15, 2021. If Products Corporation is unable to repay or refinance the 5.75% Senior Notes in full prior to November 16, 2020 (91 days before they are due) (the \"Accelerated Maturity Date\"), then, subject to certain minimum liquidity-related exceptions, the 2016 Term Loan Facility, Tranche A of the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2019 Term Loan Facility will become due on the Accelerated Maturity Date (an \"Accelerated Maturity Event\"). As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under the 5.75% Senior Notes, the 2016 Term Loan Facility, Tranche A of the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2019 Term Loan Facility was $500.0 million, $1,741.5 million, $230.9 million, and $200.0 million, respectively.\nOn March 9, 2020, Products Corporation entered into a commitment letter (the \u201c2020 Commitment Letter\u201d) with Jefferies Finance LLC to provide sufficient financing to refinance the 5.75% Senior Notes and the 2019 Term Loan Facility in full prior to the Accelerated Maturity Date. The financing under the 2020 Commitment Letter is available until June 30, 2020 and is subject to customary conditions precedent, such as the execution of definitive loan and security documents, absence of material adverse change and other customary conditions. Although the Company expects that it will be able to satisfy the conditions to the financing contemplated by the 2020 Commitment Letter, if the financing does not occur for any reason, the Company will need to obtain sufficient alternative funding (whether from borrowed funds or from the proceeds of asset sales) or amend or obtain a waiver from the lenders under the 2016 Term Loan Facility, Tranche A of the Amended 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2019 Term Loan Facility. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain any such alternative financing or amendment or waiver on favorable terms or at all. If an Accelerated Maturity Event were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. For a discussion of factors affecting Products Corporation's ability to repay or refinance indebtedness by maturity and the consequences of its inability to do so, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - \u201cProducts Corporation\u2019s ability to pay the principal amount of its indebtedness depends on many factors.\u201d\nThe Company depends on its Oxford, North Carolina facility for production of a substantial portion of its products. Disruptions at this facility and/or at other Company or third-party facilities at which the Company's products are manufactured could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe Company produces a substantial portion of its products at its Oxford, North Carolina facility. Significant unscheduled downtime at this facility, or at other Company facilities and/or third-party facilities at which the Company's products are manufactured, whether due to equipment breakdowns, power failures, natural disasters, weather conditions hampering delivery schedules, shortages of raw materials, technology disruptions or other disruptions, including those caused by transitioning manufacturing across these facilities, or any other cause could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to provide products to its customers, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's sales, business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Additionally, if product sales exceed the Company's forecasts, internal or third-party production capacities and/or the Company's ability to procure sufficient levels of finished goods, raw materials and/or components from third-party suppliers, the Company could, from time-to-time, not have an adequate supply of products to meet customer demands, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nREVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nVolatility in costs and disruption in the supply of materials and services could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe Company purchases raw materials, including essential oils, alcohols, chemicals, containers and packaging components, from various third-party suppliers. Substantial cost increases and the unavailability of raw materials or other commodities, as well as higher costs for energy, transportation and other necessary services have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the Company\u2019s profit margins if it is unable to wholly or partially offset them, such as by achieving cost efficiencies in its supply chain, manufacturing and/or distribution activities. In addition, the Company purchases certain finished goods, raw materials, packaging and other components from single-source suppliers or a limited number of suppliers and if the Company is required to find alternative sources of supply, these new suppliers may have to be qualified under applicable industry, governmental and Company-mandated vendor standards, which can require additional investment and be time-consuming. Any significant disruption to the Company\u2019s manufacturing or sourcing of products or raw materials, packaging and other components for any reason could interrupt and delay the Company\u2019s supply of products to its retail customers. Also, the Company is continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more cost-effective manner. In some cases, the Company outsources certain functions that it believes can be performed more efficiently by third parties, such as in the areas of IT, finance, tax and human resources. These third parties could fail to provide the expected level of services, provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the expected fees. Such events, if not promptly remedied, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operation, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe Company's financial performance depends on its ability to anticipate and respond to consumer trends and changes in consumer preferences. New product introductions may not be as successful as the Company anticipates, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe Company has a rigorous process for the continuous development and evaluation of new product concepts, led by executives in marketing, sales, research and development, product development, operations, law and finance. However, consumer preference and spending patterns change rapidly and cannot be predicted with certainty. There can be no assurance that the Company will anticipate and respond to trends for beauty products effectively. Each new product launch, including those resulting from the Company's recently updated product development process, carries risks, as well as the possibility of unexpected consequences, including:\n\u2022the acceptance of the Company's new product launches by, and sales of such new products to, the Company's customers may not be as high as the Company anticipates;\n\u2022the Company's marketing, promotional, advertising and/or pricing strategies for its new products may be less effective than planned and may fail to effectively reach the targeted consumer base or engender the desired consumption of the Company's products by consumers;\n\u2022the rate of purchases by the Company's consumers may not be as high as the Company anticipates;\n\u2022the Company's wall displays to showcase its new products may fail to achieve their intended effects;\n\u2022the Company may experience out-of-stocks and/or product returns exceeding its expectations as a result of the Company's new product launches or space reconfigurations or as a result of reductions in retail display space by the Company's customers;\n\u2022the Company's net sales may also be impacted by inventory management by its customers or changes in pricing, marketing, advertising and/or promotional strategies by its customers;\n\u2022the Company may incur costs exceeding its expectations as a result of the continued development and launch of new products, including, for example, unanticipated levels of research and development costs, advertising, promotional and/or marketing expenses, sales return expenses or other costs related to launching new products;\n\u2022the Company may experience a decrease in sales of certain of the Company's existing products as a result of newly-launched products, the impact of which could be exacerbated by shelf space limitations and/or any shelf space loss.

The Company expects that, for future periods, Walmart and a small number of other customers will, in the aggregate, continue to account for a large portion of the Company's net sales. The Company may be affected by changes in the policies and demands of its customers relating to service levels, inventory de-stocking, pricing, marketing, advertising and/or promotional strategies or limitations on access to wall display space. As is customary in the consumer products industry, none of the Company's customers is under any obligation to continue purchasing products from the Company in the future.\nThe loss of Walmart and/or one or more of the Company's other customers that account for a significant portion of the Company's net sales, or any significant decrease in sales to these customers, including as a result of consolidation among such customers, retail store closures in response to the growth in retail sales through e-commerce channels, inventory management by these customers, changes in pricing, marketing, advertising and/or promotional strategies by such customers or space reconfigurations by the Company's customers or any significant decrease in the Company's display space, could reduce the Company's net sales and/or operating income and therefore could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe Company may be unable to maintain or increase its sales through the Company's primary retailers, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nA decrease in consumer demand in the U.S. and/or internationally for beauty products, inventory management by the Company's customers, changes in pricing, marketing, advertising and/or promotional strategies by the Company's customers (such as the development and/or continued expansion of private label or their own store-owned brands), a reduction in display space by the Company's customers, store closures in the brick-and-mortar channels where the Company sells its products, as consumers continue to shift purchases to online and e-commerce channels and/or a change in consumers\u2019 purchasing habits, such as with respect to retailer preferences and/or sales channels, could result in decreased sales of the Company's products, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nCompetition in the beauty industry could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe beauty industry is highly competitive. The Company competes primarily by:\n\u2022developing quality products with innovative performance features, shades, finishes, components and packaging;\n\u2022educating consumers, retail customers and salon professionals about the benefits of the Company\u2019s products both on-line and in brick and mortar retail outlets;\n\u2022anticipating and responding to changing consumer, retail customer and salon professional demands in a timely manner, including as to the timing of new product introductions and line extensions;\n\u2022offering attractively priced products relative to the product benefits provided;\n\u2022maintaining favorable brand recognition;\n\u2022generating competitive margins and inventory turns for the Company\u2019s customers by providing relevant products and executing effective pricing, incentive and promotional programs and marketing and advertising campaigns, as well as social media and influencer marketing activities;\nREVLON, INC.

Among the factors used by the Company\u2019s major customers in assessing the allocation of display space is a brand\u2019s share of the color cosmetics category. The Company's color cosmetics brands have experienced, over time, year-over-year declines in their share of the color cosmetics category in the U.S. and it is possible that the Company may continue to experience further share declines. Further declines in the Company's share for one or more of its principal brands, including with respect to the Company\u2019s Almay brand, could, among other things, contribute to the additional loss of display space and/or decreased revenues. Any significant loss of display space could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe Company's Fragrances segment depends on various brand licenses and distribution arrangements for a significant portion of its sales, and the loss of one or more of these licenses or distribution arrangements could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s rights to market and sell certain of its prestige fragrance brands are derived from licenses and other distribution arrangements from unaffiliated third parties and such business is dependent upon the continuation and renewal of such licenses and distribution arrangements on terms favorable to the Company. Each license is for a specific term and may have optional renewal terms. In addition, such licenses and distribution arrangements may be subject to the Company satisfying required minimum royalty payments, minimum advertising and promotional expenditures and satisfying minimum sales requirements. In addition, under certain circumstances, lower net sales may shorten the duration of the applicable license agreement. The loss of one or more of these licenses or other significant distribution arrangements, renewal of one or more of these arrangements on less than favorable terms, the failure to renew one or more of these arrangements and/or difficulties in finding replacement brand licenses for terminated or expired licenses could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nREVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe success of the Company's Fragrances segment depends, in part, on the demand for heritage and designer fragrance products. A decrease in demand for such products, or the loss or infringement of any intellectual property rights, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe Company's Fragrances segment has license agreements to manufacture, market and distribute a number of heritage and designer fragrance products, including those of (i) Juicy Couture, John Varvatos and AllSaints in prestige fragrances; (ii) Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Elizabeth Taylor, Jennifer Aniston and Mariah Carey in celebrity fragrances; and (iii) Ed Hardy, Lucky Brand and Geoffrey Beene in mass fragrances. In 2019, the Company's Fragrances segment derived approximately 60% of its net sales from heritage and designer fragrance brands. The demand for these products is, to some extent, dependent on the appeal to consumers of the particular designer or talent and the designer\u2019s or talent\u2019s reputation. The Company also cannot assure that the owners of the trademarks that it licenses can or will successfully maintain their intellectual property rights. If other parties infringe on the intellectual property rights that the Company licenses, the value of such brands in the marketplace may be diluted. To the extent that the heritage or designer fragrance category or a particular designer or talent ceases to be appealing to consumers or a designer\u2019s or talent\u2019s reputation is adversely affected, sales of the related products and the value of the impacted brands could decrease materially, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe Company's inability to acquire or license additional fragrance brands or secure additional distribution arrangements and arrangements could have an adverse effect on the Company's net sales and a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe success of the Fragrances segment depends in part upon the continued growth of its portfolio of owned, licensed and distributed brands, including expanding its geographic presence to take advantage of opportunities in developed and emerging regions. Efforts to increase sales of the Company's prestige fragrance portfolio and expand its geographic market presence depend upon a number of factors, including its ability to:\n\u2022develop its fragrance brand portfolio through branding, innovation and execution;\n\u2022identify and develop new and existing fragrance brands with the potential to become successful global brands;\n\u2022innovate and develop new fragrance products that are appealing to consumers;\n\u2022acquire or license additional fragrance brands or secure additional distribution arrangements and the Company's ability to obtain the required financing for these agreements and arrangements;\n\u2022expand the Company's geographic presence to take advantage of opportunities in developed and emerging regions;\n\u2022continue to expand the Company's distribution channels within existing geographies to increase trade presence, brand recognition and sales;\n\u2022expand the Company's trade presence through alternative distribution channels, such as through e-commerce channels;\n\u2022expand margins through sales growth, the development of higher margin products and overhead and supply chain integration and efficiency initiatives;\n\u2022effectively manage capital investments and working capital to improve the generation of cash flow; and\n\u2022execute any acquisitions quickly and efficiently and integrate new businesses successfully.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company can successfully achieve any or all of the above objectives in the manner or time period that it expects. Further, achieving these objectives will require investments, which may result in material short-term costs without generating any current net sales and the Company may not ultimately achieve its net sales objectives associated with such efforts. The future expansion of the Fragrances segment through acquisitions, new fragrance licenses, e-commerce initiatives or other new fragrance distribution arrangements, if any, will depend upon the ability to identify suitable brands to acquire, license or distribute and to obtain the required financing for these acquisitions, licenses or distribution arrangements or to launch or support the brands associated with these agreements or arrangements. The Company may not be able to identify, negotiate, finance or consummate such acquisitions, licenses or arrangements on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. In addition, the Company may decide to divest or discontinue certain brands or streamline operations and may incur costs and charges in doing so. The inability to acquire or license additional fragrance brands or secure additional distribution arrangements for the Fragrances segment (such as optimizing its e-commerce sales opportunities) and obtain the required financing for these agreements and arrangements could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s net sales and a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nREVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit versions of the Company\u2019s products or the unauthorized diversion by third parties of the Company\u2019s products could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s net sales and a negative impact on the Company\u2019s reputation and business.\nThird parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of the Company\u2019s products. These counterfeit products may be inferior in terms of quality and other characteristics compared to the Company\u2019s authentic products and/or the counterfeit products could pose safety risks that the Company\u2019s authentic products would not otherwise present to consumers. Consumers could confuse counterfeit products with the Company\u2019s authentic products, which could damage or diminish the image, reputation and/or value of the Company\u2019s brands and cause consumers to refrain from purchasing the Company\u2019s products in the future, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s net sales and have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s reputation.\nThe Company sells a substantial portion of its professional products to professional salon distributors and/or wholesalers. Products sold to these customers are meant to be used exclusively by salons and individual salon professionals or are sold exclusively to the retail consumers of these salons. Despite the Company\u2019s efforts to prevent diversion of such products from these customers, incidents have occurred and continue to occur whereby the Company\u2019s products are sold to sales outlets other than the intended salons and salon professionals, such as to general merchandise retailers or unapproved outlets. In some instances, these diverted products may be old, damaged or otherwise adulterated, which could damage or diminish the image, reputation and/or value of the Company\u2019s brands. In addition, such diversion may result in lower net sales of the Company\u2019s products if consumers choose to purchase diverted products and/or choose to purchase products manufactured or sold by the Company\u2019s competitors because of any perceived damage or diminishment to the image, reputation and/or value of the Company\u2019s brands.\nThe Company believes that its trademarks, patents and other intellectual property rights are extremely important to the Company\u2019s success and its competitive position. The Company devotes significant resources to registering and protecting its intellectual property rights and maintaining the positive image of its brands. The Company\u2019s trademark and patent applications may fail to result in issued registrations or provide the scope of coverage sought. Unplanned increases in legal fees and other costs associated with enforcing and/or defending the Company\u2019s trademarks, patents and/or other intellectual property rights could result in higher than expected operating expenses. The Company has been unable to eliminate, and may in the future be unable to eliminate, all counterfeiting activities, unauthorized product diversion and infringement of its trademarks, patents and/or other intellectual property, any of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s net sales and have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s reputation.\nThe Company's success depends, in part, on the quality, efficacy and safety of its products.\nThe Company's success depends, in part, on the quality, efficacy and safety of its products. If the Company's products are found or alleged to be defective or unsafe, or if they fail to meet customer or consumer standards, the Company's relationships with its customers or consumers could suffer, the appeal of one or more of the Company's brands could be diminished and the Company could lose sales and/or become subject to liability claims, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s success largely depends upon its ability to attract, hire and retain its senior management team, other key employees and a highly skilled and diverse workforce, as well as effectively implement succession planning for its senior management team, and, as such, the Company\u2019s inability to do so could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nContinuing to execute the Company's business initiatives largely depends on the Company\u2019s ability to attract, hire and retain its senior management team, other key employees and a highly skilled and diverse workforce, as well as effectively implement succession planning for its senior management team. Unexpected levels of employee turnover or the Company\u2019s failure to maintain an adequate succession plan to effectively transition current management leadership positions and/or the Company\u2019s failure to attract, hire and retain its senior management team, other key employees and a highly skilled and diverse workforce could adversely affect the Company\u2019s institutional knowledge base and/or competitive advantage. If the Company is unable to attract, hire and/or retain talented and highly qualified senior management, other key employees and/or a highly skilled and diverse workforce, or if the Company is unable to effectively provide for the succession of its senior management team, it could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nREVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe Company's foreign operations are subject to a variety of social, political and economic risks and have been, and are expected to continue to be, affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations, foreign currency controls, government-mandated pricing controls, duties, tariffs and/or other trade measures, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows and the value of its foreign assets.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had operations based in 25 foreign countries and its products were sold in approximately 150 countries. The Company is exposed to risks associated with social, political and economic conditions, including inflation, inherent in operating in foreign countries, including those in Asia (such as China and Hong Kong, which has been impacted by ongoing political unrest in that region), Australia, Canada, Eastern Europe (such as Russia), Mexico, South Africa and South America (such as Argentina), which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Such risks include hyperinflation, foreign currency devaluation, tariffs, foreign currency controls, government-mandated pricing controls, currency remittance restrictions, changes in tax laws, changes in consumer purchasing habits (including as to retailer preferences), as well as, to a lesser extent, changes in U.S. laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment.\nThe U.S. and the other countries in which the Company\u2019s products are manufactured or sold have imposed and may impose additional duties, tariffs and other retaliatory or trade protection measures, or other restrictions or regulations, or may adversely adjust prevailing quota, duty or tariff levels, which can affect the cost and availability of materials that the Company uses to manufacture and package its products and the sale of finished products. For example, the E.U. has imposed tariffs on certain beauty products imported from the U.S., which would impact the sale in the E.U. of certain of the Company\u2019s more prestige products that are manufactured in the U.S. Similarly, the tariffs imposed by the U.S. on goods and materials from China would impact any materials that the Company imports from that region for use in manufacturing or packaging in the U.S. Measures that the Company could be required to take to reduce the impact of tariff increases or trade restrictions, including shifts of production among countries and manufacturers, geographical diversification of the Company\u2019s sources of supply, adjustments in product or packaging design and fabrication, or increased prices, could increase the Company\u2019s costs and delay the Company\u2019s time to bring its products to shelf. Other governmental actions related to tariffs or international trade agreements have the potential to adversely impact demand for the Company\u2019s products, production costs, retail customers and suppliers. These risks, which could increase the Company\u2019s costs and reduce the Company\u2019s net sales and profitability, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThese risks and limitations could also affect the ability of the Company's foreign subsidiaries to obtain sufficient capital to conduct their operations in the ordinary course of business. Limitations and the difficulties that certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries may experience on the free flow of funds to and from these foreign subsidiaries could restrict the Company's ability to respond timely to challenging business conditions or changes in operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe Company's net sales outside of the U.S. for each of 2019 and 2018 represented approximately 53% and 52% of the Company's total consolidated net sales, respectively. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected the Company's results of operations and the value of the Company's foreign net assets in 2019 and they may adversely affect the Company's results of operations and the value of the Company's foreign net assets in future periods, which in turn could cause a material adverse effect on the Company's reported net sales and earnings and the comparability of period-to-period results of operations.\nProducts Corporation may, from time to time, enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge certain net cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. The foreign currency forward exchange contracts may, from time to time, be entered into primarily for the purpose of hedging anticipated inventory purchases and certain intercompany payments denominated in foreign currencies and generally have maturities of less than one year. At December 31, 2019, the notional amount of Products Corporation's foreign currency forward exchange contracts was nil. These foreign currency forward exchange contracts may not adequately protect the Company against the negative effects of foreign currency fluctuations, which could adversely affect the Company's overall liquidity.\nREVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nEconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows and/or on the financial condition of its customers and suppliers.\nEconomic conditions in the U.S. and/or other countries where the Company operates have in the past contributed, and may in the future contribute, to lower consumer spending and/or reduced credit availability. Such economic conditions have impacted, and could in the future impact, business and consumer confidence, especially in relation to discretionary purchases. These conditions could have an impact on customer and/or consumer purchases of the Company's products, which could result in a reduction of the Company's net sales, operating income and/or cash flows. Additionally, disruptions in the credit and other financial markets and economic conditions could, among other things, impair the financial condition of one or more of the Company's customers or suppliers, thereby increasing the risk of customer bad debts or non-performance by suppliers. These conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe U.K.\u2019s ongoing withdrawal process from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe Company is a multinational company with worldwide operations, including material business operations in Europe. In June 2016, a majority of voters in the U.K. elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national referendum. In March 2017, the U.K. government invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on the European Union and the U.K. exited the European Union on January 31, 2020. The \"Brexit\" process has created significant ongoing uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.K. and the European Union and has given rise to calls for the governments of other European Union member states to consider withdrawal from the European Union. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets and could significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Asset valuations, currency exchange rates and credit ratings may be especially subject to increased market volatility. Lack of clarity about future U.K. laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate as the withdrawal process proceeds, including financial laws and regulations, tax and free trade agreements, intellectual property rights, supply chain logistics, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, immigration laws and employment laws, could decrease foreign direct investment in the U.K., increase costs, depress economic activity, restrict the Company\u2019s access to capital and make regulatory compliance and the distribution, sourcing, manufacturing and sales and marketing of the Company\u2019s products more difficult or costly. If the U.K. and the European Union are unable to negotiate acceptable withdrawal terms or if other European Union member states pursue withdrawal, barrier-free access between the U.K. and other European Union member states or among the European economic area overall could be diminished or eliminated. Similar adverse consequences could occur if regions such as Catalonia, where the Company's Spain businesses are headquartered, eventually succeed in withdrawing from their parent country. Approximately 4% of the Company's net sales are in the U.K. and approximately 16% of the Company's net sales are in the remainder of the European Union. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nTerrorist attacks, acts of war or military actions and/or other civil unrest may adversely affect the territories in which the Company operates and the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nOn September 11, 2001, the U.S. was the target of terrorist attacks of unprecedented scope. These attacks contributed to major instability in the U.S. and other financial markets and reduced consumer confidence. These terrorist attacks, as well as subsequent terrorist attacks (such as those that have occurred in Berlin, Germany; Nice, France; Orlando, Florida; Istanbul, Turkey; Brussels, Belgium; Paris, France; Benghazi, Libya; Madrid, Spain; London, England and most recently the attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, Iraq and the U.S.'s military response to such attack), attempted terrorist attacks, military responses to terrorist attacks, other military actions and/or civil unrest, such as that occurring in France, the Ukraine, Venezuela, Turkey, Syria, Iraq and surrounding areas and, most recently in Hong Kong, may adversely affect prevailing economic conditions, resulting in work stoppages, reduced consumer spending and/or reduced demand for the Company's products. These developments subject the Company's worldwide operations to increased risks and, depending on their magnitude, could reduce the Company's net sales and therefore could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nREVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDeclines in the financial markets may result in increased pension expense and increased cash contributions to the Company's pension plans.\nDeclines in the U.S. and global financial markets could result in significant declines in the Company's pension plan assets and result in increased pension expense and cash contributions to the Company's pension plans. Interest rate levels will affect the discount rate used to value the Company's year-end pension benefit obligations. One or more of these factors, individually or taken together, could impact future required cash contributions to the Company's pension plans and pension expense. Any one or more of these conditions could reduce the Company's available liquidity, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nExtreme weather conditions and natural disasters could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nExtreme weather conditions that impact the retail store locations of the Company\u2019s customers, or the locations of the Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, overseas offices, third-party suppliers and/or other vendors, such as the recent fire disasters in Australia and California, could disrupt the supply and shipment of the Company\u2019s products to consumers, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's sales, business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company\u2019s operations in Australia represented approximately 4% of the Company\u2019s total net sales. Moreover, natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tsunamis and the recent earthquakes impacting Puerto Rico, whether occurring in the U.S. or abroad, and their related consequences and effects, including energy shortages and public health issues, could result in economic instability and/or disruptions to the Company\u2019s operations and/or the operations of the Company\u2019s retail customers, distributors, third-party-suppliers and other vendors, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's sales, business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe ongoing occurrence of the coronavirus and any possible recurrence of other similar types of pandemics, or any other widespread public health problems, could result in decreased sales of the Company's products, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nWhile the impact on the Company\u2019s business from the recent outbreak of the coronavirus is unknown at this time and difficult to predict, various aspects of the Company\u2019s business could be adversely affected by the outbreak and the possible recurrence of other similar pandemic public health problems. In early 2020, China began reporting on the spread of the coronavirus and thousands of cases of the disease have since been identified throughout the rest of Asia, as well as in Europe, the U.S., Latin America and other regions that are important to the Company\u2019s business in terms of sales, manufacturing and other aspects of its supply chain. While there are many unknowns as to the duration and severity of the coronavirus outbreak, in 2020 there has been a significant decline in air travel and consumer traffic in key shopping and tourist areas around the globe, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s travel retail business, among others.\nAny prolonged outbreak of the coronavirus could result in the imposition of quarantines or closures of retailer locations, office spaces, manufacturing facilities, travel and transportation restrictions and/or import and export restrictions, any of which could contribute to a general slowdown in the global economy.\nAny extended pandemic outbreak, such as is occurring with the coronavirus, could cause the Company\u2019s key third party suppliers or the Company itself to temporarily close one or more manufacturing facilities, which could lead to a shortage of raw materials, components and finished products. Also, if one or more of the Company\u2019s key customers were required to close for an extended period, the Company might not be able to ship products to them and consumers may decrease their level of purchasing activity, which would adversely impact the Company\u2019s net sales. In addition, governmental authorities may recommend or impose other measures that could cause significant disruptions to the Company\u2019s business operations in the regions most impacted by the coronavirus, such as in Asia and Travel Retail globally. Any of the foregoing events or other unforeseen consequences of public health problems could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nREVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe Company's products are subject to federal, state and international regulations that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to numerous laws, regulations and trade policies. The Company is subject to regulation by the FTC and the FDA in the U.S., as well as various other federal, state, local and foreign regulatory authorities, including those in the EU, Canada and other countries in which the Company operates. The Company's Oxford, North Carolina manufacturing facility is registered with the FDA as a drug manufacturing establishment, permitting the manufacture of cosmetics and other beauty-care products that contain over-the-counter drug ingredients, such as sunscreens, anti-perspirant deodorants and anti-dandruff hair-care products. Regulations in the U.S., the EU, Canada and other countries in which the Company operates that are designed to protect consumers or the environment have an increasing influence on the Company's product claims, ingredients and packaging. To the extent federal, state, local and/or foreign regulatory changes occur in the future, whether due to changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations and enforcement policies by regulatory authorities, they could require the Company to reformulate or discontinue certain of its products or revise its product packaging or labeling, any of which could result in, among other things, increased costs to the Company, delays in product launches, product returns or recalls and lower net sales, and therefore could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nAny violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other similar foreign anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s revenue is derived from operations outside the U.S. and the Company has significant facilities outside the U.S., which exposes the Company to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent in conducting international business transactions. The Company is subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and other similar foreign anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and other types of improper payments. While the Company\u2019s employees and agents are required to comply with these laws and the Company has developed policies and procedures to facilitate compliance with such laws, there is no assurance that the Company\u2019s policies and procedures will prevent all violations of these laws, despite the Company\u2019s long-standing commitment to conducting its business and achieving its objectives by maintaining the highest level of ethical standards and legal compliance. The SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice, and their foreign counterparts, have continued to increase their enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA and similar foreign anti-corruption laws and any violation of these laws or allegations of such may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions, as well as other substantial costs and penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nDisruptions to the Company's information technology systems could disrupt the Company's business operations which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe operation of the Company's business depends on the Company's information technology systems. The Company relies on its information technology systems to effectively manage, among other things, the Company's business data, communications, supply chain, inventory management, customer order entry and order fulfillment, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, human resources benefits and payroll management, compliance with regulatory, legal and tax requirements and other processes and data necessary to manage the Company's business. Disruptions to the Company's information technology systems, including any disruptions to the Company's current systems and/or as a result of transitioning to additional or replacement information technology systems, as the case may be, could disrupt the Company's business and could result in, among other things, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, loss of data and the loss of sales and customers, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. In addition, the Company's information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond the Company's control, including, without limitation, fire, natural disasters, power outages, systems disruptions, system conversions, security breaches, cyberattacks, phishing attacks, viruses and/or human error. In any such event, the Company could be required to make a significant investment to fix or replace its information technology systems, and the Company could experience interruptions in its ability to service its customers. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nREVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIn addition, as part of the Company's normal business activities, the Company collects and stores certain confidential information, including personal information with respect to customers, consumers and employees, as well as information related to intellectual property, and the success of its e-commerce operations depends on the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. The Company may share some of this information with vendors who assist the Company with certain aspects of its business. Moreover, the success of the Company\u2019s e-commerce operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. Any failure on the part of the Company or its vendors to maintain the security of this confidential data and personal information, including via the penetration of the Company\u2019s network security (or those if its vendors) and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information, could result in business disruption, damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation, any or all of which could result in the Company incurring potentially substantial costs. Such events could also result in the deterioration of confidence in the Company by employees, consumers and customers and cause other competitive disadvantages. In addition, a security or data privacy breach could require the Company to expend significant additional resources to enhance its information security systems and could result in a disruption to the Company\u2019s operations. Furthermore, third parties, such as the Company\u2019s suppliers and retail customers, may also rely on information technology and be subject to such cybersecurity breaches. These breaches may negatively impact their businesses, which could in turn disrupt the Company\u2019s supply chain and/or the Company\u2019s business operations. Due to the potential significant costs, business disruption and reputational damage that typically accompany a cyberattack or cybersecurity breach, any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s information technology systems, or those of its third-party service providers, may be accessed by unauthorized users such as cyber criminals as a result of a disruption, cyberattack or other security breach. Cyberattacks and other cybersecurity incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives. Such cyberattacks and cyber incidents can take many forms, including cyber extortion, social engineering, password theft or introduction of viruses or malware, such as ransomware through phishing emails. As techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, a disruption, cyberattack or other security breach of the Company\u2019s information technology systems or infrastructure, or those of its third-party service providers, may go undetected for an extended period and could result in the theft, transfer, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss or destruction of Company, employee, representative, customer, vendor, consumer and/or other third-party data, including sensitive or confidential data, personal information and/or intellectual property. The Company cannot guarantee that its security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns of the Company\u2019s or its third-party service providers\u2019 information technology systems. In addition, like most major corporations, the Company's information systems are a target of cyberattacks and although the incidents that the Company has experienced to date have not had a material effect, if the Company suffers a material loss or disclosure of confidential information as a result of a breach of its information technology systems, including those of its third-party service providers, the Company may suffer reputational, competitive and/or business harm, incur significant costs and be subject to government investigations, litigation, fines and/or damages, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nFurther, the Company is subject to an evolving body of federal, state and non-U.S. laws, rules, regulations, guidelines and principles regarding data privacy and security. Several governments, including the E.U., have regulations dealing with the collection and use of personal information obtained from their citizens, and regulators globally are also imposing greater monetary fines for privacy violations. As of May 2018, the European privacy regulation General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) went into effect, strengthening and expanding the rules pertaining to how organizations are required to handle the personal data of individuals located in the EU at the time the data is collected. GDPR establishes new requirements regarding the handling of personal data, and non-compliance with the GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to 4% of the Company\u2019s worldwide revenue. In addition, the State of California recently enacted a data privacy law applicable to entities serving or employing California residents (the \u201cCCPA\u201d) that will require compliance by January 2020. The GDPR, the CCPA and other changes in federal, state and foreign laws, rules or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data and other personal information, require the Company to evaluate its current operations, information technology systems and data handling practices and to implement enhancements and adaptations where necessary to comply with these new laws, rules and regulations, which could greatly increase the Company\u2019s operational costs or require the Company to adapt certain operations or activities to comply with the stricter regulatory requirements. The Company's inability to comply with such laws, rules, regulations, guidelines and principles or to quickly adapt the Company's practices to reflect them as they develop, could potentially subject the Company to significant fines, damages, liabilities and reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nREVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe Company previously identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting, which has now been remediated. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe Company previously disclosed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting primarily related to control deficiencies within various aspects of its control environment. As a result of these control deficiencies, the Company concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was not effective for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. During 2019, the Company completed a series of actions and measures that effectively remediated the previously-disclosed material weakness and concluded that as of December 31, 2019 its internal control over financial reporting was effective. See Item 9A. - \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this 2019 Form 10-K. The Company cannot provide assurances that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not occur in the future and that it will be able to remediate such weaknesses or deficiencies in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nFurthermore, if the remediated material weakness recurs in the future or a new material weakness occurs, it could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to prepare its future financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. If the Company were unable to prepare its future financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, such circumstances would expose the Company to potential events of default (if not cured or waived) under the financial and operating covenants contained in Products Corporation\u2019s various debt instruments and cause the Company to seek any necessary consents, waivers or amendments from its lenders. Under such circumstances, Products Corporation faces the risk that it may not be able to obtain any such consents, waivers or amendments, that the terms of any such consents, waivers or amendments will be less favorable than the current terms of its indebtedness and/or Products Corporation may not be able to refinance its existing indebtedness to enable it to repay that indebtedness when it becomes due. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors - \u201cProducts Corporation\u2019s substantial indebtedness could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and flexibility and Products Corporation\u2019s ability to service its debt,\u201d \u201cProducts Corporation\u2019s ability to pay the principal amount of its indebtedness depends on many factors\u201d and \u201cRestrictions and covenants in Products Corporation\u2019s various debt instruments limit its ability to take certain actions and impose consequences in the event of failure to comply.\u201d Also, if the Company is unable to prepare its future financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, it could result in damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, financial obligations to third parties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation, any or all of which could result in additional business disruptions and the Company incurring potentially substantial costs.\nThe Company may not realize the cost reductions and other benefits that it expects from its various restructuring programs that may be in effect from time to time, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nFrom time to time, the Company implements restructuring program, such as the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program (such programs as may be in effect from time to time being referred to as \u201cRestructuring Programs\u201d) that are generally designed to streamline the Company\u2019s operations, reporting structures and business processes, with the objective of maximizing productivity and improving profitability, cash flows and liquidity. Events and circumstances may occur that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as delays caused by third parties and unexpected costs, that could result in the Company not realizing all of the anticipated cost reductions and benefits or the Company not realizing the cost reductions or other benefits on its expected timetable. In addition, changes in foreign exchange rates, commodity costs and/or in tax, labor or other laws may result in the Company not achieving the anticipated cost reductions and benefits, as measured in U.S. dollars. If the Company is unable to realize the Restructuring Programs\u2019 cost reduction objectives and other benefits, the Company\u2019s ability to fund other initiatives and enhance its profitability may be adversely affected. In addition, some of the actions that the Company is taking in furtherance of the Restructuring Programs may become a distraction for the Company\u2019s managers and employees and may disrupt the Company\u2019s ongoing business operations; cause deterioration in employee morale which may make it more difficult for the Company to retain or attract qualified employees; disrupt or weaken the Company\u2019s internal control structures; and/or give rise to negative publicity which could affect the Company\u2019s business reputation. If the Company is unable to successfully implement the Restructuring Programs, in whole or in part, in accordance with the Company\u2019s expectations, it could adversely affect its business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. For additional information regarding the 2018 Optimization Program, refer to Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Restructuring charges and other, net.\u201d For additional information regarding the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program, see Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Recent Developments - Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program.\u201d\nREVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nShares of Revlon Class A Common Stock and Products Corporation's capital stock are pledged to secure various of Revlon's and/or other of the Company's affiliates\u2019 obligations and foreclosure upon these shares or dispositions of shares could result in the acceleration of debt under Products Corporation's 2016 Senior Credit Facilities, 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility, 2019 Term Loan Facility, Amended 2019 Senior Line of Credit Facility and/or its Senior Notes and could have other consequences.\nAll of Products Corporation's shares of common stock are pledged to secure Revlon\u2019s guarantee under the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities. MacAndrews & Forbes has advised the Company that it has pledged shares of Revlon\u2019s Class A Common Stock to secure certain obligations of MacAndrews & Forbes. Additional shares of Revlon and shares of common stock of intermediate holding companies between Revlon and MacAndrews & Forbes may from time-to-time be pledged to secure obligations of MacAndrews & Forbes. A default under any of these obligations that are secured by the pledged shares could cause a foreclosure with respect to such shares of Revlon's Class A Common Stock, Products Corporation's common stock or stock of intermediate holding companies between Revlon and MacAndrews & Forbes.\nA foreclosure upon any such shares of common stock or dispositions of shares of Revlon\u2019s Class A Common Stock, Products Corporation's common stock or stock of intermediate holding companies between Revlon and MacAndrews & Forbes that are beneficially owned by MacAndrews & Forbes could, in a sufficient amount, constitute a \"change of control\" under Products Corporation\u2019s 2016 Credit Agreements, the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Agreement, the 2019 Term Loan Facility and the Senior Notes Indentures. A change of control constitutes an event of default under the 2016 Credit Agreements, the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Agreement and the 2019 Term Loan Facility that would permit Products Corporation's and its subsidiaries' lenders to accelerate amounts outstanding under such facilities. In addition, holders of the Senior Notes may require Products Corporation to repurchase their respective notes under those circumstances.\nProducts Corporation may not have sufficient funds at the time of any such change of control to repay in full or in part the borrowings under the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities, the 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Facility, the 2019 Term Loan Facility and the Amended 2019 Senior Line of Credit Facility (as a result of its cross-default provisions) and/or to repurchase or redeem some or all of the Senior Notes. (See also Item 1A. Risk Factors - \"The Company's ability to service its debt and meet its cash requirements depends on many factors, including achieving anticipated levels of revenue and expenses. If such revenue or expense levels prove to be other than as anticipated, the Company may be unable to meet its cash requirements or Products Corporation may be unable to meet the requirements of the 2016 Credit Agreements, 2018 Foreign Asset-Based Term Loan Agreement, 2019 Term Loan Agreement and/or Amended 2019 Senior Line of Credit Agreement, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\")\nChanges in tax laws or the examination of the Company's tax positions could increase (or decrease) the Company's tax obligations and effective tax rate, which could materially and adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nTax laws in the various jurisdictions where the Company conducts business are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of existing law are issued or applied (possibly with a retroactive effect). The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions. The Company records tax expense based on current tax payments and its estimates of future tax payments, which include reserves for estimates of probable settlements of international and domestic tax audits. At any one time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. As a result, the Company expects that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in its quarterly tax rates as taxable events occur and exposures are re-evaluated. Further, the Company's effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in tax laws, changes in the mix and level of earnings by taxing jurisdiction, changes to existing accounting rules or regulations or changes to the Company's ownership or capital structures. Fluctuations in the Company's tax obligations and effective tax rate could materially adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nREVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nUncertainties in the interpretation and application of the U.S. income tax provisions could have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\"). The Tax Act made broad changes to the U.S. federal income tax code, including reducing the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, imposing limitations on the Company's ability to deduct interest expense for tax purposes and reducing U.S. tax on qualified dividends received from non-U.S. subsidiaries, amongst many other complex provisions. The ultimate impact of such tax reforms may differ from the Company's current estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by the Company from the issuance of further regulations or guidance. As additional regulatory and interpretative guidance is issued, the Company may refine its analysis and make adjustments that differ from amounts initially recorded. Various uncertainties also exist in terms of how U.S. states and any foreign countries within which the Company operates will react to these U.S. federal income tax reforms. Any such developments could have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nMacAndrews & Forbes has the power to direct and control the Company's business.\nMacAndrews & Forbes is beneficially owned by Ronald O. Perelman. Mr. Perelman, through MacAndrews & Forbes, beneficially owned approximately 87.1% of Revlon's outstanding Class A Common Stock on December 31, 2019. As a result, MacAndrews & Forbes is able to control the election of the entire Board of Directors of Revlon and of Products Corporation's Board of Directors (as it is a wholly owned subsidiary of Revlon) and controls the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of Revlon\u2019s and Products Corporation's stockholders, including the approval of mergers, consolidations, sales of some, substantially all or all of the Company's assets, issuances of capital stock and similar transactions.", "PERMNO": 82859, "SIC": 2844, "TIC": "REV"}
