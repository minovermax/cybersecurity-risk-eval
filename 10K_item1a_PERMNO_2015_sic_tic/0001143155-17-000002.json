{"cik": "1143155", "company": "Xenith Bankshares, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information included in this Form 10-K, the following factors should be carefully considered in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained herein. Any of the following risks, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, regulatory capital levels and prospects. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, we could be materially and adversely affected. There may be additional risks that we do not presently know, are unknowable, or that we currently believe are immaterial that could also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, regulatory capital levels and prospects.\nGeneral economic conditions in our target markets may decline and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe economies where we do business, especially the greater Washington, D.C., and greater Hampton Roads areas, are heavily reliant on federal government and military spending and may be adversely impacted by significant cuts to such spending that could result from Congressional budgetary enactments. Real estate values are affected by various factors in addition to local economic conditions, including, changes in general or regional economic conditions, government rules or policies, and natural disasters. With 83.2% of our loans concentrated in the regions of Washington, D.C., Hampton Roads, Richmond, the Eastern Shore of Virginia, and Northeast North Carolina regions, a decline in local economic conditions could adversely affect the value of the real estate collateral securing our loans. A decline in property values could diminish our ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral, making it more likely that we would suffer additional losses on defaulted loans and/or foreclosed properties by requiring additions to our allowance for loan losses through increased provisions for loan losses. Also, a decline in local economic conditions may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of financial institutions whose real estate portfolios are more geographically diverse. While our policy is to obtain updated appraisals on a periodic basis, there are no assurances that we may be able to realize the amount indicated in the appraisal upon disposition of the underlying property. We take into account all available information in assessing the fair value of other real estate owned and repossessed assets, including pending offers, recent appraisals and other indicators. However, differences may exist between our estimate of fair value and the amount we ultimately realize upon sale, and such differences could be material.\nFluctuations in interest rates could reduce our results of operations as we expect to realize income primarily from the difference between interest earned on our loans and investments and interest paid on our deposits and borrowings.\nLike other banks, our results of operations are significantly dependent on our net interest income, as we expect to realize income primarily from the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Rate-sensitive assets and liabilities have interest rate terms that are subject to change within a specific time period, due to either maturity or contractual agreements that allow the instruments to reprice prior to maturity. The net position of those assets and liabilities, subject to re-pricing in specified time periods, will positively or negatively affect our results of operations. If market interest rates should move contrary to our position, our results of operations could be negatively affected, potentially materially. We use financial tools to simulate our interest-rate sensitivity; however, neither we, nor the tools, can predict fluctuations of market interest rates, which are affected by many factors, including inflation, recession, monetary policy and conditions in domestic and foreign financial markets. Our balance sheet is \"asset-sensitive;\" therefore, should interest rates change, our assets will reprice faster than our liabilities. Although our asset-liability management strategy is intended to manage our risk from changes in market interest rates, continued low interest rates could materially and adversely affect us. See additional discussion in Part II, Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption \"Interest Rate Sensitivity.\"\nChanges in market interest rates could reduce the value of our financial assets. Fixed rate investments and loans generally decrease in value as interest rates rise. In addition, volatile interest rates may affect the volume of our lending activities. For example, when interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing increases and loan originations may decrease. This could result in lower net interest income, lower loan origination fee income, and a decline in sales of treasury services. If we are unsuccessful in managing the effects of changes in interest rates, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe face significant competition in our target markets.\nThe financial services industry, including commercial banking, is highly competitive, and we have encountered and will continue to encounter strong competition for deposits, loans and other financial services and products in our target markets. Our principal competitors for loans and some or all of our other services and products are other commercial banks and community banks in our\nXENITH BANKSHARES, INC.\ntarget markets. Our principal competitors for deposits include large national and regional financial institutions, savings banks and other independent community banks, as well as credit unions and consumer finance companies. Our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulation as we are and, accordingly, have advantages over us in providing certain products and services. Many of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have greater access to capital and other resources that permit them to offer attractive terms and broader selections to gain market share for their products and services and also have higher lending capacity and larger branch networks. As a result, we could lose business to competitors or be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract customers, either of which would adversely affect us.\nFailure to implement our business strategies could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe have developed a strategic plan that details the business strategies we intend to implement. Our strategic plan includes organic growth and, where appropriate, growth through acquisitions. Our organic growth may involve an expansion into related banking lines of business and related services and products and growth through acquisitions also includes risks, could be expensive and put a strain on our management, financial, operational and technical resources, among the other risks described below under \"We will face risks with respect to future expansion and if we grow through acquisitions or mergers.\" Also, to manage growth effectively, we will likely have to continue to enhance our operating systems and controls, as well as integrate new personnel, including relationship managers, and manage expanded operations. If we cannot implement our business strategies, we will be hampered in our ability to maintain, grow and manage our business effectively and to serve our customers, which would in turn materially and adversely affect us. Even if our business strategies are successfully implemented, they may not have the favorable impact on our operations that we anticipate.\nOur continued integration of Legacy Xenith may be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger may not be realized.\nThe success of the Merger, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, depends, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate Legacy Xenith in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt the existing customer relations nor result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers. It is possible that the continued integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. As with any merger of financial institutions, there also may be business disruptions that cause us to lose customers or cause customers to remove their accounts from the Bank and move their business to competing financial institutions.\nWe will face risks with respect to future expansion and if we grow through acquisitions or mergers.\nWe may seek to acquire other financial institutions or branches or assets of those institutions. We may also expand into new markets or lines of business or offer new products or services. These activities would involve a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger partners, the outcome of which is uncertain;\n\u2022\nusing inaccurate estimates and judgments or lack of information to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution or its branches or assets;\n\u2022\ndiluting our existing shareholders in an acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe time and expense associated with evaluating new markets for expansion, hiring experienced local management, and opening new offices or branches, as there may be a substantial time lag between these activities and when we generate sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion;\n\u2022\ninvesting a significant amount of time negotiating a transaction or working on expansion plans, resulting in management's time and attention being diverted from the operation of our existing business;\n\u2022\nthe time and expense associated with integrating the operations and personnel of the combined businesses;\n\u2022\nthe ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition;\nXENITH BANKSHARES, INC.\n\u2022\ncreating an adverse short-term effect on our results of operations;\n\u2022\nlosing key employees and customers as a result of an acquisition that is poorly received or executed;\n\u2022\ntime and costs associated with regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain additional capital or financing, if necessary, on favorable terms or at all; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen adjustments, write-downs, write-offs, or restructuring or other impairment charges.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions with which we do business could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, acting as a counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, including counterparties in the financial industry, such as commercial banks. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions will expose us to risk of loss in the event of default of a counterparty or client. In addition, this risk may be exacerbated when any collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us. Our losses from these events could be material.\nOur earnings are sensitive to the credit risks associated with lending.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, we rely on information furnished by or on behalf of our customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. We also rely on representations of those customers or counterparties or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports or other financial information could result in losses that materially and adversely affect us. Even if we receive accurate information, we may misjudge that information and fail to assess the credit risks in a manner that materially and adversely affects us. In addition, when considering whether to make a loan secured by real property, we generally require an appraisal of the property. However, an appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made, and an error in fact or judgment could adversely affect the reliability of an appraisal. Also, events occurring after the initial appraisal may cause the value of the real estate to decrease. As a result of any of these factors, the value of collateral backing a loan may be less than supposed, and if a default occurs, we may not recover the outstanding balance of the loan.\nThe credit risk associated with C&I loans is a result of several factors, including the concentration of our loan portfolio in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the size of loan balances and the effects of general economic conditions on a borrower's business. Our C&I loan portfolio represented approximately 36.4% of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2016. Any significant default by our commercial and industrial customers would materially and adversely affect us. Our C&I loans include owner-occupied real estate loans that are secured in part by the value of the real estate. Owner-occupied real estate loans represented approximately 30.6% of our total C&I loan portfolio as of December 31, 2016. The primary source of repayment for owner-occupied real estate loans is the cash flow produced by the related commercial enterprise, and the value of the real estate is a secondary source of repayment of the loan.\nOur CRE loan portfolio represented approximately 23.8% of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2016. CRE loans may pose greater risks than other types of loans. Underwriting and portfolio management activities cannot eliminate all risks related to these loans. It may be more difficult for commercial real estate borrowers to repay their loans in a timely manner in the current economic climate, as commercial real estate borrowers' abilities to repay their loans frequently depends on the successful development of their properties. In addition, because payments on loans secured by these properties generally are dependent on the income produced by the underlying properties, we may incur losses on CRE loans due to declines in occupancy rates and rental rates, which may decrease property values and may decrease the likelihood that a borrower may find permanent financing alternatives. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, we could incur material losses. In addition, banking regulators give greater scrutiny to CRE lending and may require banks with higher levels of CRE loans to implement improved or additional underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies and portfolio stress testing. In banks with certain levels of CRE loan concentrations, regulators may require increased levels of reserves for loan losses, as well as the need for additional capital. Any of these events could increase our costs, require management time and attention, and materially and adversely affect us.\nXENITH BANKSHARES, INC.\nOur RRE loan portfolio represented approximately 16.4% of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2016. RRE loans consist of first and second lien loans, including home equity lines and credit loans, secured by residential real estate that is located primarily in our target markets. Typically, our maximum loan-to-value benchmark for these loans is 80% at inception, with satisfactory debt-to-income ratios as well. The repayment of RRE loans depends primarily on the income and cash flows of the borrowers, with the real estate serving as a secondary source of repayment.\nDecisions regarding credit risk in our loan portfolios could be inaccurate and our allowance for loan losses may be inadequate to absorb future losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nInherent risks in lending include the deterioration of the credit of borrowers and adverse changes in the industries and competitive environments in which they operate, changes in borrowers' management and business prospects, fluctuations in interest rates and collateral values, principally real estate, and economic downturns. Making loans is an essential element of our business, and there is a high risk that some portion of the loans we make will not be repaid and, accordingly, will result in losses.\nThe risk of loss is affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\ncredit risks of a particular borrower;\n\u2022\nthe duration of the loan;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic or industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nin the case of a collateralized loan, risks resulting from uncertainties about the future value of the collateral.\nIn addition, we may suffer higher credit losses because of federal or state legislation or other regulatory action that reduces the amount that our borrowers are required to pay to us, prohibits or otherwise limits our ability to foreclose on properties or other collateral, or makes foreclosures less economically viable.\nAs with all financial institutions, our management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectability of our loan portfolio, and we maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to our expenses that represents management's best estimate of probable losses within our existing portfolio of loans, and other reserves to absorb anticipated future losses inherent in our portfolio. Our allowance for loan losses was $21.9 million at December 31, 2016, which represented 0.89% of our total loans, as compared to $23.2 million, or 1.50% of total loans, at December 31, 2015. The level of the allowance reflects management's estimates and judgments as to specific credit risks, evaluation of industry concentrations, loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic, political and regulatory conditions, and incurred but unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio.\nThe determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires management to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. In addition, regulatory agencies, as a part of their examination process, periodically review the estimated losses of loans. Such agencies may require us to recognize additional losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. If management's assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate and our allowance for loan losses is inadequate to absorb future losses inherent in our loan portfolio, or if bank regulatory agencies require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or to recognize loan charge-offs, our capital could be significantly reduced, and we could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, the adoption of changes in the way entities recognize expected credit losses pursuant to GAAP, when implemented, may require us to increase our estimate for losses in our loan portfolio, resulting in an adverse impact to our results of operations and level of regulatory capital.\nAlthough our problem loans have declined significantly, there is no assurance that they will continue to do so.\nOur nonperforming assets ratio, defined as the ratio of nonperforming assets (loans and other real estate owned and repossessed assets) to total assets was 1.15% and 2.32% at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2016, 0.71% of our loans were 30 to 89 days delinquent and treated as performing assets. The administration of nonperforming loans is an important function in attempting to mitigate any future losses related to our nonperforming assets.\nOur decisions regarding the fair value of assets acquired could be different than initially estimated, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nXENITH BANKSHARES, INC.\nAs required by acquisition accounting rules, we eliminated the allowance for loan losses that was recorded by Legacy Xenith and recorded acquired loans at estimated fair values as of the effective date of the Merger by creating a discount. Additionally, we recorded acquired other real estate owned and repossessed assets at estimated fair values as of the effective date of the Merger. To the extent the credit losses of the purchased loans are greater than fair value adjustments or the amounts we might ultimately realize on the sale of other real estate owned and repossessed assets are less than the fair values determined at the effective date of the Merger, our net income could be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges in U.S. tax laws could adversely impact us.\nTax laws may change in ways that adversely impact us. For example, federal tax legislation could be enacted to reduce the existing statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, which would, accordingly, reduce our deferred tax assets. The effect of a reduction in a tax rate on our net deferred tax assets is required to be recognized, in full, as a reduction of income in the period enacted. In addition, a reduction in the existing statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate could increase the after-tax effect of future loss events and our after-tax borrowing costs.\nOur investment portfolio has benefited from certain tax exemptions and certain other tax laws and regulations, including those the income from which is tax-exempt. The effect of a reduction in the federal income tax rate or changes in certain other tax laws would lessen or eliminate some or all of the tax advantages currently benefiting us and therefore could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, such legislation could adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio, which would have an adverse affect on our shareholders' equity. Our investment portfolio was comprised 20% of tax-exempt municipal bonds as of December 31, 2016, the value of which could be adversely affected by a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate. Additionally, our net deferred tax assets could be adversely affected by a reduction in the fair value of our investment portfolio.\nOther tax law changes could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. For example, budget constraints faced by many states and localities increase the likelihood that state and local governments will raise revenue by enacting legislation increasing the taxes paid by individuals and corporations. In addition, any federal tax reform that is designed to reduce the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in a \"revenue neutral\" manner could include other provisions that materially increase our taxable income or otherwise increase our cost of doing business.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to fully realize our deferred tax assets.\nWe have federal income tax net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards and other tax attributes, including future tax deductible items, that relate to our deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, we released substantially all of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. Our conclusion, as of these dates, that it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets, was based on our expectation that we would generate taxable income in future years sufficient to absorb substantially all of our NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income, we may not be able to fully realize our deferred tax assets and would be required to record a valuation allowance against these assets. A valuation allowance would be recorded as income tax expense and would adversely affect our net income.\nSales of our common stock by our institutional investors or merger or acquisition activity may result in an ownership change of control, thus limiting our ability to realize our deferred tax assets.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had approximately $330.0 million of federal NOLs to be carried forward. Our ability to utilize our NOLs is subject to the rules of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\"Section 382\"), which generally restricts the use of NOLs after an \"ownership change.\" An ownership change occurs if, among other things, there is a cumulative increase of more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of stock ownership by the shareholders (or specified groups of shareholders) who own or have owned, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of a corporation's common stock or are otherwise treated as 5% shareholders under Section 382 and Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder because of an increase of these shareholders over a rolling three-year period. In the event of an ownership change, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income a corporation may offset with NOL carryforwards. This annual limitation is generally equal to the product of the value of the corporation's stock on the date of the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate published monthly by the Internal Revenue Service. This annual limitation may be increased for five years after an ownership change by any \"built-in gain\", which is the amount of a hypothetical intangible calculated as the value of the corporation less the fair value of tangible assets at the time of the ownership change. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years until the applicable expiration date for the respective NOLs.\nXENITH BANKSHARES, INC.\nPursuant to the various definitive investment agreements that we have entered into with Anchorage, CapGen and Carlyle, we have an effective registration statement covering the resale of shares of our common stock by each of these shareholders. These shareholders could utilize this registration statement by reselling the shares of our common stock that they currently hold. If any of these shareholders sell large amounts of our common stock an ownership change could occur. Additionally, any merger or acquisition activity in which we may engage would require us to evaluate whether an ownership change would occur. Given the rights of our institutional investors and level of merger and acquisition activity in our target markets, we cannot ensure that our ability to use our NOLs to offset income will not become limited in the future. As a result, we could pay taxes earlier and in larger amounts than would be the case if our NOLs were available to reduce our federal income taxes without restriction. If the utilization of our NOLs is restricted, we would be required to record a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, which could materially and adversely affect our net income.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation in the conduct of our business operations, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nThe banking industry is heavily regulated by several governmental agencies. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors, deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, and not shareholders and other creditors. These regulations affect lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, operations and growth, among other things. For example, federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations limit the manner in which banks may offer and extend credit. In addition, the laws governing bankruptcy generally favor debtors, making it more expensive and more difficult to collect from customers who become subject to bankruptcy proceedings.\nFrom time to time, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures consider changing these laws and may enact new laws or amend existing laws to further regulate the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act has resulted, and will continue to result, in sweeping changes in the regulation of financial institutions. See Part I, Item 1 - Business under the caption \"Supervision and Regulation - Dodd-Frank Act.\"\nMany of the provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act remain subject to regulatory rule-making and implementation, the effects of which are not yet known. Although we cannot predict the specific impact and long-term effects that the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder will have on us and our prospects, our target markets and the financial industry more generally, we believe that the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder will impose additional administrative burdens that will obligate us to incur additional costs.\nChanges to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could, among other things, subject us to additional costs and lower revenues, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer, increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, and require a significant amount of management's time and attention. Failure to comply with statutes, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties or reputation damage, any of which could materially and adversely affect us.\nBanking regulators have broad enforcement power, but regulations are meant to protect depositors and not investors.\nWe are subject to supervision by several governmental regulatory agencies. The regulators' interpretation and application of relevant regulations are beyond our control, may change rapidly and unpredictably, and can be expected to influence our earnings and growth. In addition, if we do not comply with regulations that are applicable to us, we could be subject to regulatory penalties, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. All such government regulations may limit our growth and the return to our investors by restricting activities such as the payment of dividends, mergers with, or acquisitions by, other institutions, investments, loans and interest rates, interest rates paid on deposits and the use of brokered deposits. Although these regulations impose costs on us, they are intended to protect depositors. The regulations to which we are subject may not always be in the best interests of investors.\nThe fiscal, monetary and regulatory policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its policies determine, in large part, the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments, both of which affect our net interest margin. It also can materially decrease the value of financial assets we hold, such as debt securities. Its policies also can adversely affect borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans.\nXENITH BANKSHARES, INC.\nIn addition, as a public company, we are subject to securities laws and standards imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Because we are a relatively small company, the costs of compliance are disproportionate compared with much larger organizations. Continued growth of legal and regulatory compliance mandates could adversely affect our expenses, future results of operations and the market price of our common stock. In addition, the government and regulatory authorities have the power to impose rules or other requirements, including requirements that we are unable to anticipate, that could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and the market price of our common stock.\nCommercial real estate lending guidance issued by the federal banking regulators could impact our operations and capital requirements.\nThe Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC, along with the other federal banking regulators, issued guidance entitled \"Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices\" directed at financial institutions that have particularly high concentrations of CRE loans within their loan portfolios. This guidance suggests that institutions whose CRE loans exceed certain percentages of capital should implement heightened risk management practices appropriate to their concentration risk and may be required to maintain higher capital ratios than institutions with lower concentrations in CRE lending. These agencies jointly issued a \"Statement on Prudent Risk Management for Commercial Real Estate Lending\" on December 2016 to remind banks of the need to engage in risk management practices for CRE lending. Based on our CRE loan concentration as of December 31, 2016, we are not subject to additional supervisory analysis but could be in the future, and we believe our credit administration policies to be consistent with the recently published policy statement. Our management has implemented controls to monitor our CRE lending and will continue to enhance and monitor those controls, but we cannot predict the extent to which this guidance may impact our future operations or capital requirements. Also, any risk management practices that we implement may not be effective to prevent losses in our loan portfolio, including our commercial real estate portfolio.\nOur ability to maintain regulatory capital levels and adequate sources of funding and liquidity may be adversely affected by market conditions, concentration of customer deposits within certain businesses and industries, and changes in capital requirements made by our regulators.\nWe are required to maintain certain capital levels sufficient to maintain capital ratios that classify the Bank as \"well capitalized\" in accordance with banking regulations. We must also seek to maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support our lending and investment operations and repay our outstanding liabilities as they become due. Our ability to maintain regulatory capital levels, available sources of funding and sufficient liquidity could be impacted by the concentration of customer deposits within certain businesses and industries and deteriorating economic and market conditions.\nOur failure to meet any applicable regulatory guideline related to our lending activities or any capital requirement otherwise imposed upon us or to satisfy any other regulatory requirement could subject us to certain activity restrictions or to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the regulatory authorities, including limitations on our ability to pay dividends or pursue acquisitions, the issuance by regulatory authorities of a capital directive to increase capital, and the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC.\nIn determining the adequacy of our capital levels, we use risk-based capital ratios established by regulations. The Basel III Rules increase capital ratios for all banking organizations and introduce a \"capital conservation buffer,\" which is in addition to each capital ratio. If a banking organization dips into its capital conservation buffer, it would be subject to limitations on certain activities including payment of dividends, share repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers. Although we currently cannot predict the specific impact and long-term effects that the Basel III Rules will have on us and the banking industry more generally, we will be required to maintain higher regulatory capital levels, which could impact our operations, net income and ability to grow. Furthermore, our failure to comply with the minimum capital requirements could result in our regulators taking formal or informal actions against us, which could restrict our future growth or operations.\nWe may not be able to access funding sufficient to support our growth.\nOur business strategies are based on access to funding from local customer deposits, such as checking and savings accounts and certificates of deposits. Deposit levels may be affected by a number of factors, including interest rates paid by competitors, general interest rate levels, returns available to customers on alternative investments and general economic conditions. If our deposit levels fall, we could lose a relatively low cost source of funding, and our costs would increase from alternative funding. If local customer deposits are not sufficient to fund our growth, we will look to outside sources such as borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (\"FHLB\"), which is a secured funding source. Our ability to access borrowings from the FHLB will be dependent upon whether and the extent to which we can provide collateral. We may also look to federal funds purchased and\nXENITH BANKSHARES, INC.\nbrokered deposits as discussed below under \"Our use of brokered deposits may be limited or discouraged by bank regulators, which could adversely impact our liquidity\" or seek to raise funds through the issuance of shares of our common stock or other equity or equity-related securities or the incurrence of debt as additional sources of liquidity. If we are unable to access funding sufficient to support our growth or are only able to access such funding on unattractive terms, we may not be able to implement our business strategies.\nWe rely substantially on deposits made by our customers in our target markets, which can be materially and adversely affected by local and general economic conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2016, $1.7 billion, or 66.2%, of our total deposits, consisted of noninterest-bearing demand accounts and interest-bearing savings, money market and demand accounts. The $870.1 million remaining balance of deposits includes time deposits, of which approximately $623.2 million, or 24.2% of our total deposits, are due to mature within one year.\nOur ability to attract and maintain deposits, as well as our cost of funds, has been and will continue to be significantly affected by rates offered by competitors, alternative investment opportunities, monetary policy and general economic conditions. Competition impacts interest rates paid to attract deposits as well as fees charged on deposit products. In addition to the competitive pressures from other depository institutions, we face heightened competition from non-depository financial products such as securities, other alternative investments and technology-based savings vehicles. Furthermore, technology and other market changes have made it more convenient for bank customers to transfer funds for investing purposes. We have significant deposits from certain customers that are in excess of the FDIC insurance amounts. Customers may withdraw deposits in an effort to ensure that the amount they have on deposit with the Bank is fully insured or may place them in other financial institutions that they perceive as being more secure. The loss of customers that maintain significant deposits with the Bank could have an adverse effect on this critical funding source. If we fail to attract new deposits or maintain existing deposits or are forced to increase interest rates paid to customers to attract and maintain deposits, our net interest income would be negatively impacted and we could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition to competitive forces, we also are at risk from market forces as they affect interest rates. It is not uncommon when interest rates transition from a low interest rate environment to a rising rate environment for deposit and other funding costs to rise in advance of yields on earning assets. In order to keep deposits required for funding purposes, it may be necessary to raise deposit rates without commensurate increases in asset pricing in the short term.\nOur use of brokered deposits may be limited or discouraged by bank regulators, which could adversely impact our liquidity.\nDepositors that invest in brokered deposits are generally interest-rate sensitive and well informed about alternative markets and investments. Consequently, these types of deposits may not provide the same stability to a bank's deposit base as traditional local retail deposit relationships. Our liquidity may be negatively affected if that funding source experiences supply difficulties due to loss of investor confidence or a flight to other investments. Regulatory developments with respect to wholesale funding, including increased FDIC insurance costs for, or limits on the use of these deposits, may further limit the availability of that alternative. In light of regulatory pressure, there may be a cost premium for locally generated certificates of deposit as compared to brokered deposits, which may increase our cost of funding. As of December 31, 2016, $133.7 million, or 5.2% of our deposits, were brokered deposits.\nWe may not be able to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us or at all.\nWe may need additional capital to support our business, expand our operations, or maintain our minimum capital requirements; however, we may not be able to raise additional funds through the issuance of shares of our common stock or other equity or equity related securities or in an acquisition or a merger. Furthermore, the significant amount of our common stock that our institutional investors own may discourage other potential investors from acquiring newly-issued shares of our common stock or other equity or equity related securities.\nWe may not be able to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and other creditors.\nOur liquidity is used to make loans and investments and to repay liabilities (including deposits), as they become due or are demanded by depositors and other creditors. Our main source of liquidity is customer deposits. As a part of our liquidity management, we use a number of funding sources in addition to core deposits and repayments and maturities of loans and investments. Potential alternative sources of liquidity include federal funds purchased and investment securities sold under\nXENITH BANKSHARES, INC.\nrepurchase agreements, as well as the sale of loans, securities (to the extent not pledged as collateral) or other assets, the utilization of available government and regulatory assistance programs, brokered deposits, borrowings from the FHLB, borrowings through the Federal Reserve Bank's (\"FRB\") discount window, borrowings from other banks, and the issuance of debt and equity securities. Without sufficient liquidity from these potential sources, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and other creditors, or to operate and grow our business.\nAs we continue to grow, we may become more dependent on wholesale funding sources, which may include FHLB borrowings and brokered deposits. As of December 31, 2016, the Bank had $172.0 million of FHLB borrowings and $133.7 million of brokered deposits outstanding. If we are required to rely more heavily on wholesale funding sources to support our operations or growth in the future and such funding is expensive at such time, our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs. In that case, our net interest income would be reduced, and we could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may become subject to significant liabilities in the event the Bank forecloses upon, or takes title to, real property.\nWhen underwriting a CRE or RRE loan, we will generally take a lien on the real property and, in some instances upon a default by the borrower, we may foreclose upon and take title to the property, which may lead to potential financial risk for us under applicable environmental laws. We may also take over the management of commercial properties whose owners have defaulted on loans. We may also own and lease premises where branches and other facilities are located. While we have lending, foreclosure and facilities guidelines intended to exclude properties with an unreasonable risk of contamination, hazardous substances could exist on some of the properties that the Bank may own, manage or occupy. We face the risk that environmental laws could force us to clean up the properties at our expense. It may cost much more to remediate a property than the property is worth. We could also be liable for pollution generated by a borrower's operations, if the Bank takes a role in managing those operations after a default. Many environmental laws impose liability, regardless of whether we knew of, or were responsible for, any contamination that existed or exists for the property. The Bank may also find it difficult or impossible to sell contaminated properties. These costs could be significant and could materially and adversely affect our net income.\nThe disposition processes related to our nonperforming assets could result in losses in the future that would materially and adversely affect us.\nWe may incur additional losses relating to nonperforming loans and other real estate owned and repossessed assets and such losses could be material. When we acquire title to collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, we are required by accounting rules to mark such collateral to the then fair market value, less costs of disposal, which could result in a loss. Nonperforming assets adversely affect net income in various ways. While we pay interest expense to fund nonperforming assets, no interest income is recorded on nonaccrual loans or other real estate owned, thereby adversely affecting income and returns on assets and equity. Additionally, we incur loan administration costs and the costs of maintaining properties carried as other real estate owned. Nonperforming loans and other real estate owned also increase our risk profile, and increases in the level of nonperforming loans and other real estate owned could impact our regulators' view of appropriate capital levels in light of such risks.\nWhile we seek to manage our problem assets through loan sales, workouts, restructurings, foreclosures and otherwise, decreases in the value of these assets, or in the underlying collateral, or in these borrowers' results of operations, liquidity or financial condition, whether or not due to economic and market conditions beyond our or their control, could materially and adversely affect us. In addition, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant amount of management's time and attention, diverting their time from other business, which could be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities on our behalf.\nGiven the geographic concentration of our operations, we could be significantly affected by any natural or man-made disaster that affects Virginia and surrounding areas.\nOur operations are concentrated in, and our loan portfolio consists almost entirely of, loans to persons and businesses located in and around Virginia, including Maryland and North Carolina. The collateral for many of our loans consists of real and personal property located in areas susceptible to hurricanes and other natural disasters, as well as man-made disasters that can cause extensive damage to the general region. Disaster conditions that hit in our target markets would adversely affect the local economies and real estate markets. Adverse economic conditions resulting from such a disaster could negatively affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans and could reduce the value of the collateral securing these loans. Furthermore, damage resulting from any natural or man-made disaster could also result in continued economic uncertainty that could negatively impact\nXENITH BANKSHARES, INC.\nbusinesses in those areas. As a result, we could be materially and adversely affected by any natural or man-made disaster that affects our target markets.\nOur success is largely dependent on attracting and retaining key management team members, and the loss of such persons could negatively affect our ability to execute our business strategies.\nWe are a customer focused and relationship driven organization. Future growth is expected to be driven in large part by the relationships maintained with customers. While we have assembled an experienced and talented senior management team, maintaining this team, while at the same time developing other managers and/or attracting new talent in order that management succession can be achieved, is not assured. The unexpected loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to execute our strategic plan, and may result in lower revenues or reduced earnings.\nOur business is dependent on technology and an inability to invest in technological improvements or obtain reliable technological support may materially and adversely affect us.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology driven services and products. In addition to better serve our customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our ability to grow and compete will depend in part upon our ability to address the needs of customers by using technology to provide services and products that will satisfy their operational needs, while managing the costs of expanding our technology infrastructure. Many competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements and third-party support. For the foreseeable future, we expect to rely on third-party service providers for our core technology systems and on other third parties for technical support and related services. If we are unable to implement and market new technology driven services and products successfully, or if those services and products become unreliable or fail, our customer relationships and operations could be adversely affected, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nSystem failure or breaches, including \"hacking,\" \"cyber fraud\" or \"identity theft,\" of our network security could lead to increased operating costs, as well as litigation and other liabilities.\nThe computer systems and network infrastructure we use could be vulnerable to unforeseen hardware and cybersecurity issues, including \"hacking,\" \"cyber fraud\" and \"identity theft.\" Our operations are dependent in part upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, or a similar catastrophic event. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect the computer systems and network infrastructure utilized by our customers and us, including our Internet banking activities, against damage from physical break-ins, cybersecurity breaches and other disruptive problems caused by the Internet or other users. Such computer break-ins and other disruptions would jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure, which may result in significant liability to us, damage our reputation, and inhibit current and potential customers from our Internet banking services. Each year, we incur expenses to add additional security measures to our computer systems and network infrastructure to mitigate the possibility of cybersecurity breaches, including firewalls and penetration testing. We maintain insurance coverage for certain types of cybersecurity incidents, but there can be no assurance that coverage will exist or be adequate to cover potential losses. A security breach could also subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability.\nIn February 2013, an executive order, Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (the \"Executive Order\"), was released that is focused primarily on government actions to support critical infrastructure owners and operators in protecting their systems and networks from cyber threats. The Executive Order requires the development of risk-based cybersecurity standards, methodologies, procedures and processes, a so-called \"Cybersecurity Framework,\" that can be used voluntarily by critical infrastructure companies to address cyber risks. The Executive Order also steers certain private sector companies to comply voluntarily with the Cybersecurity Framework. In response to the Executive Order, the FFIEC has published cybersecurity guidance, along with observations from recent cybersecurity assessments. These assessments were conducted with the goal of identifying gaps in the regulators' examination procedures and training that can be used to strengthen the oversight of cybersecurity readiness. If, as a result of the Executive Order, or otherwise, our regulators were to recommend guidance that required us to further implement cyber security infrastructure, we could incur additional costs.\nBankCap Partners is a bank holding company that is deemed to be a multi-bank holding company and the Bank may be obligated to provide financial assistance to any other financial institution as to which BankCap Partners is deemed to be a bank holding company.\nXENITH BANKSHARES, INC.\nUnder the Federal Reserve guidelines, a bank holding company must serve as a \"source of strength\" for each bank in which it holds a controlling equity interest. Currently, BankCap Partners is deemed to be a bank holding company for the Bank and Atlantic Capital Bank, and CapGen is deemed to be a bank holding company for the Bank. The position of BankCap Partners as a source of strength for Atlantic Capital Bank may limit its ability to serve as a source of strength to the Bank and could adversely affect the Bank's ability to access resources of BankCap Partners. Federal bank regulatory agencies have additional discretion to require a bank holding company to divest itself of any bank or non-bank subsidiary, if the agency determines that divestiture may aid the depository institution's financial condition.\nIn addition, the Bank may be required to indemnify, or cross-guarantee, the FDIC against losses the FDIC incurs with respect to any other bank controlled by BankCap Partners. Also, FDICIA requires that an insured depository institution shall be liable for the loss incurred or anticipated to be incurred by the FDIC arising from the default of a commonly controlled insured depository institution or any assistance provided by the FDIC to any commonly controlled insured depository institution in danger of default. Accordingly, the Bank may be obligated to provide financial assistance to Atlantic Capital Bank, the other bank for which BankCap Partners is deemed to be a bank holding company. Any financial assistance that the Bank is required to provide would reduce our capital and could materially and adversely affect us.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, current and potential shareholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting and disclosures and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"Section 404\"), we are required to include in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K our management's assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. While our management's assessment included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 did not identify any material weaknesses, we cannot guarantee that we will not have any material weaknesses identified by our management or our independent registered public accounting firm in the future.\nCompliance with the requirements of Section 404 is expensive and time-consuming. If, in the future, we fail to comply with these requirements in a timely manner, or if our management or independent registered public accounting firm expresses a qualified or otherwise negative opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of confidence in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, any failure to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures could cause our current and potential shareholders and customers to lose confidence in our financial reporting and disclosure required under the Exchange Act, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nThe accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures could be affected if future events differ significantly from the judgments, assumptions and estimates in our critical accounting policies.\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosure in conformity with GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our critical accounting policies, which we summarize in Part II, Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption \"Critical Accounting Policies,\" describe those significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that we consider \"critical\" because they require judgments, assumptions and estimates about the future that materially impact our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. For example, material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of our allowance for loan losses, the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans, the valuation of our deferred tax assets and the application of acquisition accounting principles relating to acquisitions. As a result, if future events differ significantly from the judgments, assumptions and estimates in our critical accounting policies, those events could have a material impact on the accuracy of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, and ultimately negatively affect our net income.\nThe market value of our investments may decline, which could cause a decline in our shareholders' equity and negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe have designated a portion of our investment portfolio as securities available for sale pursuant to applicable accounting standards relating to accounting for investments. These standards require that unrealized gains and losses in the estimated fair value of the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio be reflected as a separate item in shareholders' equity, net of tax, as AOCI. As of December 31, 2016, we had $317.4 million, or 9.7% of our total assets, in securities available for sale at fair value. Shareholders' equity reflects the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, of these investments. Management believes that several\nXENITH BANKSHARES, INC.\nfactors will affect the market values of our investment securities portfolio. These include changes in interest rates or expectations of changes, the degree of volatility in the securities markets, inflation rates or expectations of inflation, the slope of the interest rate yield curve (i.e., the differences between shorter-term and longer-term interest rates), and reduced investor demand. The decline in the market value of our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio results in a corresponding decline in shareholders' equity. Lower market values for our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities may result in recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge to our net income, thus also reducing our shareholders' equity.\nWe do not pay dividends on our common stock currently and do not intend to do pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe suspended the payment of dividends since the third quarter of 2009 and we do not intend to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. We are limited in the amount of dividends that we may pay to our shareholders pursuant to state and federal laws and regulations. See Part I, Item 1 - Our Business under the caption \"Supervision and Regulation - Payment of Cash Dividends.\"\nIn 2015, Legacy Xenith issued and sold 6.75% subordinated notes due 2025 (the \"Subordinated Notes\") in the amount of $8.5 million, which we assumed in the Merger. The terms of the Subordinated Notes restrict us from paying any dividends while an event of default exists and from paying cash dividends if certain regulatory capital ratios are below prescribed levels. Any future financing arrangements that we enter into may also limit our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. Accordingly, we may never legally be able to pay dividends to shareholders of our common stock. Further, even if we have earnings and available cash in an amount sufficient to pay dividends to shareholders of our common stock, our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may decide to retain them and therefore not pay dividends in the future.\nOur institutional investors own a significant number of shares of our common stock, which will enable them to influence the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders.\nAs of December 31, 2016, CapGen beneficially owned 5,107,514 shares of our common stock, Carlyle beneficially owned 4,239,858 shares of our common stock, Anchorage beneficially owned 4,239,858 shares of our common stock, and BankCap Partners beneficially owned 1,615,460 shares of our common stock (including warrants to purchase 172,260 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $26.20 per share, all of which warrants are currently exercisable), representing a total of 65.7% beneficial ownership of the outstanding shares of our common stock.\nIn addition, under the terms of our agreements with Carlyle, Anchorage and CapGen, our board of directors must include a director designated by each of Carlyle, Anchorage and CapGen. Under the terms of our agreement with BankCap Partners and certain shareholders, we have agreed to take such actions as are necessary to nominate for election, and BankCap Partners and the holders have agreed to take such actions as are necessary to elect and to vote their shares of our common stock in favor of one individual designated by BankCap Partners at our 2016 annual meeting of shareholders, at our 2017 annual meeting of shareholders, and at any other meeting of our shareholders held prior to the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders at which the shareholders will be voting on the election of directors.\nJames F. Burr, a managing director in the Global Financial Services Group of Carlyle, is the current designee of Carlyle; Edward Grebow is the current designee of Anchorage; Robert F. Goldstein, founding principal in CapGen Capital Advisers LLC, is the current designee of CapGen; and Scott A. Reed, a principal of BankCap Partners, is the current designee of BankCap Partners.\nAccordingly, our institutional investors, through their beneficial ownership of our common stock and board rights, will be able to participate in matters that come before our board of directors and influence the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders, including the election of directors, amendments to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended (our \"Articles of Incorporation\"), our By Laws, as amended (our \"Bylaws\"), mergers or other business combination transactions, and certain sales of assets outside the usual and regular course of business. The interests of our institutional investors may not coincide with the interests of our other shareholders, and our institutional investors could take actions that advance their own interests to the detriment of our other shareholders.\nSales, or the perception that sales could occur, of large amounts of our common stock by our institutional investors may depress our stock price.\nThe market price of our common stock could drop if our existing institutional investors decide to sell their shares. As of December 31, 2016, Anchorage, CapGen, Carlyle and BankCap Partners owned 18.3%, 22.1%, 18.3% and 6.9%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Pursuant to the various agreements that we have entered into with Anchorage, CapGen and Carlyle, we have an effective registration statement covering the resale of shares of our common stock by each of\nXENITH BANKSHARES, INC.\nthese shareholders. These shareholders could utilize this registration statement to resell the shares of our common stock that they currently hold. If any of these shareholders sell large amounts of our common stock, or other investors perceive such sales to be imminent, the market price of our common stock could drop significantly.\nCertain provisions of Virginia law and our Articles of Incorporation and our Bylaws could make it more difficult for our shareholders to remove our board of directors and management and also could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control transaction.\nCertain provisions of Virginia law, the state in which we are incorporated, and our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws could make it more difficult for our shareholders to remove our board of directors and management and also could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control transaction that could otherwise provide our shareholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price of our common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our shareholders. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na provision allowing our board of directors to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock without any vote or action by the holders of common stock or that could otherwise adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of common stock;\n\u2022\nsubject to certain exceptions, the application of the Virginia Affiliated Transactions Statute prohibiting us from entering into a business combination with the beneficial owner of 10% or more of our outstanding voting stock for a period of three years after the 10% or greater owner first reached that level of stock ownership;\n\u2022\na provision that allows us to amend or eliminate a Bylaw provision opting out of the application of the Virginia Control Share Acquisitions Statute without shareholder approval;\n\u2022\na provision allowing the removal of directors only for cause;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that shareholders provide advance notice when nominating directors; and\n\u2022\nthe inability of shareholders to convene a special shareholders' meeting without the chairman of the board, the president, the chief executive officer or a majority of the board of directors calling the meeting and to consider matters outside the scope of the business specified in the notice for such meeting.\nXENITH BANKSHARES, INC.", "PERMNO": 91431, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "XBKS"}
