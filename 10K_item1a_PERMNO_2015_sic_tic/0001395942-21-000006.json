{"cik": "1395942", "company": "KAR Auction Services, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our Company involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to invest in our Company. The occurrence of any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, prospects, results of operations and cash flows. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. These risks are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to create significant risk and uncertainty and has had, and is expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial results will continue to depend on future developments that are uncertain and unpredictable, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effectiveness of actions taken to contain the COVID-19 outbreak or treat its impact. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic implicates and exacerbates many of the other risks described in this Item 1A. \"Risk Factors,\u201d including but not limited to risks relating to general economic conditions. This situation continues to evolve and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently. Due to the unprecedented nature of the pandemic and responses thereto, we cannot identify all of the risks we face from the pandemic and its aftermath.\nGovernments in the various jurisdictions we operate have mandated, and continue to introduce, numerous and varying measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, curfews, shelter-in-place and safer-at-home orders, business shutdowns and closures. Certain jurisdictions began easing restrictions only to return to tighter restrictions in the face of increases in new COVID-19 cases. These measures have not only negatively impacted consumer spending and business spending habits, they have also adversely impacted and are expected to continue to impact our workforce and operations and the operations of our customers, suppliers and business partners. Specifically, the measures taken to slow the spread of COVID-19 have impacted our business by directly impacting retail automobile sales; lowering sales volumes, which could be depressed longer than expected; requiring our employees to work from home; and limiting the number of attendees at our sites. The duration of these measures is unknown, may be extended and additional measures may be imposed, and they are likely to continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCOVID-19 has caused and may continue to cause us to modify our business practices. We are focused on attempting to mitigate the negative impacts of COVID-19 on our business, which has required and will continue to require a substantial investment of time and resources across our enterprise. While we have developed and implemented and continue to develop and implement health and safety protocols, business continuity plans and crisis management protocols in an effort to try to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 on our employees and our business, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts. Further, our increased reliance on remote access to our information systems continues to increase our exposure to cybersecurity attacks or data security incidents, along with other risks related to the reliability of technology to support remote operations.\nThe broader implications for our business and results of operations remain uncertain and will depend on many factors outside our control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the timing and extent to which normal economic and operating conditions resumes. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of its impact.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry. If we are not successful in competing with our known competitors and/or disruptive new entrants, then our market position or competitive advantage could be threatened and our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe face significant competition for the supply of used vehicles, the buyers of those vehicles and the floorplan financing of these vehicles. Our principal sources of competition historically have come from: (1) direct competitors (e.g., Manheim and NextGear Capital), (2) new entrants, including new vehicle remarketing venues and dealer financing services, and (3) other participants in the automotive industry with vehicle remarketing capabilities (e.g., rental car companies, automobile retailers and wholesalers). Due to the increasing use of the Internet and other technology as marketing and distribution channels, we also face increasing competition from online wholesale and retail marketplaces (generally without any meaningful physical presence) and from our own customers when they sell directly to end users through such platforms rather than remarket vehicles through our marketplaces. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced margins or loss of market share.\nOur future success also depends on our ability to respond to evolving industry trends, changes in customer requirements and new technologies. One potentially adverse trend would be a market shift towards the simultaneous listing and selling of vehicles on multiple online sales platforms in North America. Were such a trend to take hold, the vehicle remarketing industry's economics could significantly change. For example, we might need to incur additional costs or otherwise alter our business model to adapt to these changes. In such case, the volume of vehicles supplied to us and our overall revenues and fees per vehicle sold could decrease. Participants in the North American whole car industry continue to discuss the development of a multiple platform bidding system. This could cause us to lose vehicle volume and market share, and our business, revenues and profitability could be negatively impacted.\nSome of our competitors may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do, may be able to respond more quickly to evolving industry dynamics and changes in customer requirements, or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of new or emerging services and technologies. If we are unable to compete successfully or to successfully adapt to industry changes, our business, revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, if one or more of our competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Our competitors may also establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future data providers, technology partners, or other parties with whom we have relationships, thereby limiting our ability to develop, improve, and promote our solutions. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors, and competitive pressures may harm our revenue, business, and financial results.\nADESA, through its on-premise and off-premise wholesale vehicle platforms, currently competes with online wholesale and retail vehicle selling platforms, including OVE.com and RMS Automotive (both affiliated with Cox Enterprises, Inc.), SmartAuction, mobile applications (e.g., ACV Auctions and EBlock) and others. With the exception of OVE.com, these online selling platforms generally do not have any meaningful physical presence and may cause the volume of vehicles sold through our on-premise and off-premise marketplaces to decrease. If the number of vehicles sold through our auctions decreases due to these competitors or other industry changes, our revenue and profitability may be negatively impacted. In addition, our long-lived assets could also become subject to impairment.\nIn the dealer-to-dealer auction market, our mobile applications, TradeRev and BacklotCars, currently compete with ACV Auctions, EBlock, Manheim Express, CarWave, TradeHelper and others. The dealer-to-dealer space is experiencing a digital disruption as competitors and new market participants introduce new technologies. If TradeRev and BacklotCars are unable to compete and gain market share in the dealer-to-dealer space, our business and revenues may be negatively impacted.\nAt the national level, AFC's competition includes NextGear Capital, a subsidiary of Cox Enterprises, Inc., other specialty lenders, banks and financial institutions. At the local level, AFC faces competition from banks, credit unions and independent auctions who may offer floorplan financing to local auction customers. Such entities typically service only one or a small number of auctions. Some of our industry competitors who operate whole car auctions on a national scale may endeavor to capture a larger portion of the floorplan financing market. AFC offers its customers competitive rates and fees and competes primarily on the basis of quality of service, convenience of payment, scope of services offered and historical and consistent commitment to the sector. If the number of loans originated and serviced decreases due to these competitors, our revenue and profitability may be negatively impacted.\nWe may not properly leverage or make the appropriate investment in technology advancements, which could result in the loss of any sustainable competitive advantage in products, services and processes.\nOur business is dependent on information technology, particularly as we execute our digital transformation strategy. Robust information technology systems, platforms and products are critical to our operating environment, digital online products and competitive position. It is strategically significant that we lead the digital transformation occurring in our industry. We may not be successful in structuring our technology or developing, acquiring or implementing technology systems which are competitive and responsive to the needs of our customers. We might lack sufficient resources to continue to make the significant technology investments to effectively compete with our competitors. Certain technology initiatives that management considers important to our long-term success will require capital investment, have significant risks associated with their execution, and could take several years to implement. If we are unable to develop and implement these initiatives in a cost-effective, timely manner or at all, it could damage our relationships with our customers and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that others will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do or that we will acquire technologies on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage. If we do not accurately predict, prepare and respond to new kinds of technology innovations, market developments and changing customer needs, our revenues, profitability and long-term competitiveness could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to successfully execute on our business strategy, if our strategy proves to be ineffective, or if we improperly align new strategies with our vision, our business, financial performance and growth could be adversely affected.\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition depend on our ability to execute our business strategy. See \u201cOur Business Strategy\u201d under \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There are significant risks involved with the execution of these initiatives, including significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether we will succeed in implementing these strategic initiatives, and even if we do succeed, we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategy. It could take several years to realize any direct financial benefits from these initiatives, if any direct financial benefits from these initiatives are achieved at all.\nUnsuccessful implementation of business initiatives to reduce costs and align our business to our digital operating model, or unintended consequences of the implementation of such initiatives, may adversely affect our business.\nWe have taken certain steps, including reductions in force, internal reorganizations and reallocation of resources from physical to digital channels to reduce the cost of our operations, improve efficiencies, and realign our organization and staffing to better match our market opportunities and digital initiatives. We have shifted and continue to shift resources from our physical channels to efforts focused on digital channels and technologies, and we continue our efforts to reduce overhead and manage our variable and fixed-cost structure. We may continue to take similar steps in the future as we seek to realize operating synergies, achieve our target operating model and profitability objectives, and more closely reflect changes in the strategic direction of our business. These changes could be disruptive to our business, and we may experience a loss of accumulated knowledge, loss of continuity and inefficiency, adverse effects on employee morale, loss of key personnel and other retention issues during transitional periods. These initiatives can require a significant amount of time and focus, which may divert attention from operating and growing our business. In addition, many of our competitors continue to offer a traditional physical channel auction environment. If our efforts to focus on digital channels and technologies do not engage customers at the same level as in the past, or if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our cost reduction and business alignment initiatives, it could have an adverse effect on our competitive position and market share, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to meet our customers\u2019 expectations, which could impact customer retention and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe believe our future success depends in part on our ability to respond to changes in customer requirements and our ability to meet regulatory requirements for our customers. Our customers include vehicle manufacturers and their captive finance arms, vehicle leasing and rental companies, financial institutions, fleet management companies, franchised and independent used vehicle dealers, automotive wholesalers, insurance companies, non-profit organizations, automotive body shops, rebuilders, exporters and brokers. We work to develop strong relationships and interactive dialogue with our customers to better understand current trends and customer needs. If we are not successful in meeting our customers' expectations, our customer relationships could be negatively affected and result in a loss of future business, which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nADESA\u2019s agreements with its largest commercial suppliers of used vehicles are generally subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days\u2019 notice. In addition, it is common that commercial suppliers regularly review their relationships with whole car auctions through written requests for proposals. Such suppliers may from time to time require us to make changes to the way we do business as part of the request for proposal process or provide services on less favorable terms. There can be no assurance that our existing agreements will not be canceled or that we will be able to enter into future agreements with these or other suppliers on similar terms, or at all, and our ability to grow and sustain profitability could be impaired.\nIf we fail to effectively identify, value, manage, complete and integrate acquisitions, our operating results, financial condition and growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nAcquisitions have been a significant part of our growth strategy and have enabled us to further broaden and diversify our service offerings. Our strategy generally includes acquisitions of companies, products, services and technologies to expand our online, digital and mobile capabilities and the acquisition and integration of additional facilities. Acquisition of businesses requires substantial time and attention of management personnel and may also require additional equity or debt financings. Further, integration of newly established or acquired businesses is often disruptive. There can be no assurance that we will identify appropriate targets, will acquire such businesses on favorable terms, will be able to successfully integrate such organizations into our business or will be able to realize anticipated benefits. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and they could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Acquisitions may also have unanticipated tax, legal, regulatory and accounting ramifications, including as a result of recording goodwill that is subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges. Another accounting ramification includes the valuation of contingent consideration at the acquisition date which is subject to remeasurement each reporting period and could result in additional expense. In addition,\nwe expect to compete against existing and new competitors for suitable acquisitions. If we are able to consummate acquisitions, such acquisitions could be dilutive to earnings, and we could overpay for such acquisitions.\nAdditional risks and challenges we face in connection with acquisitions include, but not limited to:\n\u2022incurring significantly higher capital expenditures, operating expenses and operating losses of the business acquired;\n\u2022coordination of technology, research and development, and sales and marketing functions, along with integration of the acquired business\u2019s accounting, management information, human resources, and other administrative systems;\n\u2022incurring liability for pre-acquisition activities of the acquired business;\n\u2022implementing or remediating the controls, procedures, and policies of the acquired business;\n\u2022incorporating acquired technology and rights into our offerings and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;\n\u2022retaining and integrating acquired employees, including cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired business into our organization;\n\u2022maintaining important business relationships and contracts of the acquired business; and\n\u2022integrating the acquired business onto our systems and ensuring the acquired business meets our financial reporting requirements and timelines.\nAny of these risks, if realized, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur expansion into markets outside the U.S. and our non-U.S. based operations subject us to unique operational, competitive and regulatory risks.\nAcquisitions and other strategies to expand our operations beyond North America subject us to significant risks and uncertainties. As a result, we may not be successful in realizing anticipated synergies or we may experience unanticipated integration expenses. As we continue to explore opportunities to expand our business internationally, we will need to develop policies and procedures to manage our business on a global scale. There can be no assurance that we will identify appropriate international targets, acquire such businesses on favorable terms, or be able to successfully grow and integrate such organizations into our business. Operationally, acquired businesses typically depend on key relationships and our failure to maintain those relationships could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, we anticipate that our non-U.S. based operations will continue to subject us to risks associated with operating on an international basis, including:\n\u2022exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk, which may have an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability;\n\u2022exposure to the principal or purchase auction model rather than the agency or consignment model, which may have an adverse impact on our margins and expose us to inventory risks;\n\u2022restrictions on our ability to repatriate funds, as well as repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions, which may result in higher effective tax rates;\n\u2022tariffs and trade barriers and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to operate in certain foreign markets;\n\u2022compliance with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act;\n\u2022compliance with various privacy regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\");\n\u2022dealing with unfamiliar regulatory agencies and laws, including those favoring local competitors;\n\u2022dealing with political and/or economic instability, including the exit of the U.K. from the E.U. (\u201cBrexit\u201d);\n\u2022the difficulty of managing and staffing foreign offices, as well as the increased travel, infrastructure, legal and compliance costs associated with international operations;\n\u2022localizing our product offerings; and\n\u2022adapting to different business cultures and market structures.\nAs we continue to explore opportunities to expand globally, our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with operating on an international basis. Our failure to manage these risks could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems could adversely affect our business and reputation.\nWe rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of our business processes and activities. The secure operation of these systems, and the processing, maintenance, enhancement and reliability of these systems, are critical to our business operations and strategy. The technology to operate some of our businesses is provided, in whole or in part, by third-party service providers, and we do not own or control the operation of third party facilities. Information technology systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, acts of war, electronic and physical break-ins, computer viruses, earthquakes and similar events. The occurrence of any of these events could damage information technology systems or hardware and cause them to fail. In addition, any financial difficulties, up to and including bankruptcy, faced by our service providers or any of their subcontractors, may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict. Information technology risks (including the confidentiality, integrity and availability of digital assets) have significantly increased as new technologies have proliferated, and as organized criminals, hackers, terrorists and other bad actors have become more sophisticated. These threats, which may be external or internal may be malicious, or may result from human or computer error. Our customers also rely on our information technology systems to conduct their operations. In addition, our customers increasingly use personal equipment and mobile devices that may be beyond our control. Any significant disruptions of our information technology systems could negatively impact our business and customers, damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nData security concerns relating to our technology or breaches of information technology systems, could adversely affect our business and reputation.\nWe have experienced cyber-attacks and security incidences of varying degrees and believe we will continue to be a potential target of such threats and attacks, particularly as we execute our digital transformation strategy. The technology infrastructure and systems of our suppliers, vendors, service providers and partners have also in the past experienced and may in the future experience such threats and attacks. Continuous cyber-attacks or a sustained attack could lead to service interruptions, malfunctions or other failures in the technology that supports our businesses and customers, as well as the operations of our customers or other third parties. Continuous cyber-attacks could also damage our reputation with our customers and other parties and the market, additional costs (such as repairing systems, adding personnel or security technologies or compliance costs), regulatory penalties, financial losses to both us and our customers and partners and the loss of customers and business opportunities. If such attacks are not detected in a timely manner, their effect could be compounded.\nAlthough we have technology and information security policies and processes and disaster recovery plans in place, these measures may not be adequate to ensure that our operations will not be compromised or disrupted should such an event occur. If our information technology systems are compromised, become inoperable for extended periods of time or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace the information technology and our ability to provide many of our electronic and online solutions to our customers may be impaired, which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and financial position. In addition, as cyber-threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Any of the risks described above could result in the loss or misuse of proprietary, confidential or sensitive information, disrupt our business, damage our reputation, expose us to legal liability and materially adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nCompliance with U.S. and global privacy and data security requirements could result in additional costs and liabilities or inhibit our ability to collect, transmit and/or store data, and the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to significant fines and penalties, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and reputation.\nAspects of our operations and businesses are subject to certain privacy regulations in the United States, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) and around the globe, including the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d). We collect, process and store sensitive data, including proprietary business and customer information, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers, their consumers and our employees. A growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification and other requirements in the event that consumer information is accessed and/or acquired by unauthorized persons, and additional regulations regarding the use, access, accuracy, security and retention of such data are possible. Our compliance with global laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security may materially increase our costs or otherwise limit our ability to continue or pursue certain business activities. Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could also result in fines, sanctions, private litigation, government enforcement, business disruption, credit reporting and other expenses, damage to our reputation and loss of customers. We maintain cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses from any future disruption, security incident or breach.\nDecreases in the supply of used vehicles coming to auction may impact auction sales volumes, which may adversely affect our revenues and profitability. In addition, a decrease in the number of used vehicles sold at on-premise marketplaces could adversely affect our revenue growth, operating results and financial condition.\nThe number of new and used vehicles that are leased by consumers affects the supply of vehicles coming to auction in future periods as the leases mature. If manufacturers and other lenders decrease the number of new vehicle lease originations and extend the terms of some of the existing leases, the number of off-lease vehicles available at auction for the industry would decline. If the supply of off-lease vehicles coming to auction declines, our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected.\nVolumes of off-lease vehicles in subsequent periods will be affected by total new vehicle sales and the future leasing behavior of manufacturers and lenders; therefore, we may not be able to accurately predict the volume of vehicles coming to auction. The supply of off-lease vehicles coming to auction is also affected by the market value of used vehicles compared to the residual value of those vehicles per the lease terms. In most cases, the lessee and the dealer have the ability to purchase the vehicle at the residual price at the end of the lease term. Generally, as market values of used vehicles rise, the number of vehicles purchased at residual value by the lessees and dealers increases, thus decreasing the number of off-lease vehicles available at auction.\nIn addition, the supply of vehicles coming to auction could be impacted by initiatives to switch from vehicles with internal combustion engines to electric vehicles. The sale of electric vehicles is dependent on consumer adoption, which could be impacted by numerous factors, including perceptions about electric vehicle features, quality, safety, performance and cost; perceptions about the range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge; high fuel-economy internal combustion engine vehicles; volatility in the cost of fuel; government regulations and economic incentives; and access to charging facilities. If consumer behavior and vehicle ownership trends move from vehicles with internal combustion engines to electric vehicles, the number of vehicles coming to auction could decline, the ancillary services we provide could decline or change, we could incur expenses associated with the purchase and installation of charging stations at our facilities and our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, off-premise marketplace platforms were utilized for the sale of approximately 49% of vehicles sold in North America by ADESA in 2020, compared with approximately 42% in 2019. If sellers and buyers increase the number of vehicles transacted on off-premise marketplace platforms, our revenue per vehicle will likely decline. In connection with online auctions, ADESA offers on-premise marketplaces, which allow buyers to physically inspect and compare vehicles. In addition, our cost structure includes a significant fixed cost component, including occupancy costs and land, that cannot be readily reduced if revenue per vehicle declines. If a shift in the percentage of used vehicles sold on off-premise marketplace platforms as compared with used vehicles sold at on-premise marketplaces occurs, and we are unable to generate new sources of revenue, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur business and operating results would be adversely affected if we lose one or more significant customers.\nLoss of business from, or changes in the consignment patterns of, our key customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Generally, commercial and dealer customers make no binding long-term commitments to us regarding consignment volumes. Any such customer could reduce its overall supply of vehicles for our auctions or otherwise seek to materially change the terms of its business relationship with us at any time. Any such change could harm our business and operating results. While no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues in 2020, the loss of, or material reduction in business from, our key customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key personnel, or have inadequate succession planning, we may not be able to execute our business strategies and our financial results could be negatively affected.\nOur success depends in large part on the talents and efforts of our executives and other key employees, including those with digital capabilities. Our future success will depend upon our ability to continue to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain talented personnel. If we lose the services of one or more of our key personnel, or if one or more key personnel joins a competitor or otherwise competes with us, we may not be able to effectively implement our business strategies and our business could be materially adversely affected. Many of our key personnel have extensive experience with our business and have established business relationships with customers and suppliers and, as a result, if we lose key personnel, we may have difficulty in executing our business plan and strategy, retaining and attracting customers on favorable terms and providing acceptable levels of customer service. Leadership changes will occur from time to time and we cannot predict whether significant resignations will occur, whether we will effectively manage leadership transitions or whether we will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel. We do not have nor do we currently expect to obtain key person insurance on any of our executive officers.\nIn addition, our failure to put in place adequate succession plans for key roles or the failure of key personnel to successfully transition into new roles could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. The unexpected or\nabrupt departure of one or more of our key personnel and the failure to effectively transfer knowledge and effect smooth key personnel transitions may have an adverse effect on our business resulting from the loss of such person\u2019s skills, knowledge of our business, and years of industry experience. If we cannot effectively manage leadership transitions and management changes in the future, our reputation and future business prospects could be adversely affected.\nUsed vehicle prices impact fee revenue per unit and may impact the supply of used vehicles, loan losses at AFC and could adversely affect our profitability.\nThe volume of new vehicle production, accuracy of lease residual estimates, interest rate fluctuations, customer demand and changes in regulations, among other things, all potentially affect the pricing of used vehicles. Used vehicle prices may affect the volume of vehicles entered for sale at our auctions and the demand for those used vehicles, the fee revenue per unit, loan losses for our dealer financing business and our ability to retain customers. When used vehicle prices are high, used vehicle dealers may retail more of their trade-in vehicles on their own rather than selling them at auction. A sustained reduction in used vehicle pricing could result in a potential loss of consignors, an increase in loan losses at AFC and decreased profitability.\nADESA also sells vehicles that have been purchased (e.g., inherited vehicles, vehicles returned under the ADESA Assurance program or vehicles purchased by ADESA Europe and others). The number of vehicles purchased by ADESA continues to grow. When a vehicle is purchased and then resold, rather than sold on a consignment basis, we are exposed to inventory risks, including losses from theft, damage and obsolescence. In addition, when vehicles are purchased, we are subject to changes in vehicle values, which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nIf our facilities lack the capacity to accept additional vehicles, then our relationships with vehicle suppliers could be adversely affected.\nWe regularly evaluate our capacity in all our markets and where appropriate, seek to increase capacity through the acquisition of additional land and facilities. We may not be able to reach agreements to purchase or lease storage facilities in markets where we have limited excess capacity, and zoning restrictions or difficulties obtaining use permits may limit our ability to expand our capacity through acquisitions of new land. In addition, we may not be able to renew or enter into new leases at commercially reasonable rates, or our facilities may be subject to condemnation or eminent domain proceedings. If we fail to have sufficient capacity at one or more of our facilities, our relationships with vehicle suppliers could be adversely affected, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nAdverse economic conditions may negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nAdverse economic conditions, including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, could increase our exposure to several risks, including:\n\u2022Fluctuations in the supply of used vehicles. We are dependent on the supply of used vehicles coming to auction, and our financial performance depends, in part, on conditions in the automotive industry. During the past global economic downturn and credit crisis, there was an erosion of retail demand for new and used vehicles that led many lenders to cut back on originations of new loans and leases and led to significant manufacturing capacity reductions by automakers selling vehicles in the United States and Canada. Capacity reductions could depress the number of vehicles received at auction in the future and could lead to reduced numbers of vehicles from various suppliers, negatively impacting auction volumes. In addition, weak growth in or declining new vehicle sales negatively impacts used vehicle trade-ins to dealers and auction volumes. These factors could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\n\u2022Decline in the demand for used vehicles. We may experience a decrease in demand for used vehicles from buyers due to factors including the lack of availability of consumer credit and declines in consumer spending and consumer confidence. Adverse credit conditions also affect the ability of dealers to secure financing to purchase used vehicles at auction, which further negatively affects buyer demand. In addition, a reduction in the number of franchised and independent used car dealers may reduce dealer demand for used vehicles.\n\u2022Decrease in consumer spending. Consumer purchases of new and used vehicles may be adversely affected by economic conditions such as employment levels, wage and salary levels, trends in consumer confidence and spending, reductions in consumer net worth, interest rates, inflation, the availability of consumer credit and taxation policies. Consumer purchases in general may decline during recessions, periods of prolonged declines in the equity markets or housing markets and periods when disposable income and perceptions of consumer wealth are lower. Changes to U.S. federal tax policy may negatively affect consumer spending. In addition, the increased use of vehicle sharing and alternate methods of transportation, including autonomous vehicles, could lead to a decrease in consumer purchases of new and used vehicles and a decrease in vehicle rentals. To the extent retail and rental car company demand for new and used vehicles decreases, negatively impacting our auction volumes, our results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected.\n\u2022Volatility in the asset-backed securities market. Volatility and disruption in the asset-backed commercial paper market could lead to a narrowing of interest rate spreads at AFC in certain periods. In addition, any volatility and disruption has affected, and could affect, AFC\u2019s cost of financing related to its securitization facility.\n\u2022Ability to service and refinance indebtedness. Uncertainty in the financial markets may negatively affect our ability to service our existing debt, access additional financing or to refinance our existing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all. If economic weakness exists, it may affect our cash flow from operations and results of operations, which may affect our ability to service payment obligations on our debt or to comply with our debt covenants.\n\u2022Increased counterparty credit risk. Any market deterioration could increase the risk of the failure of financial institutions party to our Credit Agreement and other counterparties with which we do business to honor their obligations to us. Our ability to replace any such obligations on the same or similar terms may be limited if challenging credit and general economic conditions exist.\nAFC is exposed to credit risk with our dealer borrowers, which could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\nAFC is subject to credit risk resulting from defaults in payment by our dealer customers on our floorplan loans. Furthermore, a weak economic environment, decreased demand for used vehicles, disruptions in pricing of used vehicle inventory or consumers\u2019 lack of access to financing could exert pressure on our dealer customers resulting in higher delinquencies, bankruptcies, repossessions and credit losses. There can be no assurances that our monitoring of our credit risk as it affects the collectability of these loans and our efforts to mitigate credit risk through appropriate underwriting policies and loss-mitigation strategies are, or will be, sufficient to prevent an adverse impact in our profitability and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality, assignment and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. In the United States and internationally, we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property, and we currently hold issued patents in the United States and Canada. However, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us, and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business. In any or all of these cases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights. Although we have taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that such measures will be adequate or that others will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business. Changes in laws and regulations or adverse court rulings may also negatively affect our ability to protect our proprietary rights or prevent others from using our intellectual property and technology. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe rely on third-party technology for key components of our business, and if these or other third parties do not perform adequately or terminate their relationships with us, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe rely on third-party technology for certain of our critical business functions, including certain inspection and marketplace technologies. If these technologies fail, or if such third party service providers or strategic partners were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, face financial distress or other business disruptions, increase their fees, or if our relationships with these providers or partners deteriorate or terminate, we could suffer increased costs and we may be unable to provide similar services until an equivalent provider could be found or we could develop replacement technology or operations. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in identifying or finding high-quality partners, if we fail to negotiate cost-effective relationships with them, or if we ineffectively manage these relationships, it could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nWe may be subject to patent or other intellectual property infringement claims, which could have an impact on our business or operating results due to a disruption in our business operations, the incurrence of significant costs and other factors.\nFrom time to time, we may receive notices from others claiming that we infringed or otherwise violated their patent or intellectual property rights, and the number of these claims could increase in the future. Claims of intellectual property infringement or other intellectual property violations could require us to enter into licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question, which could require us to change business practices and limit our ability to compete effectively. Even if we believe that the claims are without merit, the claims can be time-consuming and costly to defend and may divert management\u2019s\nattention and resources away from our businesses. If we are required to take any of these actions, it could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results.\nA portion of our net income is derived from our international operations, primarily Canada, which exposes us to foreign exchange risks that may impact our financial statements. In addition, increases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies may negatively impact foreign buyer participation in our marketplaces.\nFluctuations between U.S. and foreign currency values may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position, particularly fluctuations with Canadian currency values. In addition, there may be tax inefficiencies in repatriating cash from our foreign subsidiaries. Approximately 21% of our revenues were attributable to our foreign operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. Changes in the value of foreign currencies, particularly the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar could negatively affect our profits from foreign operations and the value of the net assets of our foreign operations when reported in U.S. dollars in our financial statements. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations as reported in U.S. dollars.\nIn addition, fluctuations in exchange rates may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations. For purposes of accounting, the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated using period-end exchange rates; such translation gains and losses are reported in \u201cAccumulated other comprehensive income/loss\u201d as a component of stockholders\u2019 equity. The revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated using average exchange rates during each period.\nLikewise, we have a significant number of non-U.S. based buyers who participate in our marketplaces. Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to these buyers\u2019 local currencies may reduce the prices they are willing to pay at auction, which may negatively affect our revenues.\nEnvironmental, health and safety risks could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the emission or discharge of pollutants into the air or water, the generation, treatment, storage and release of hazardous materials and wastes and the investigation and remediation of contamination. Our failure to comply with current or future environmental, health or safety laws or to obtain and comply with permits required under such laws, could subject us to liability, damage our reputation and require costly investigative, remedial or corrective actions.\nIn the used vehicle remarketing industry, large numbers of vehicles are stored and/or refurbished at auction facilities and during that time releases of fuel, motor oil and other materials may occur. We have investigated or remediated, or are currently investigating or remediating, contamination resulting from various sources, including gasoline, fuel additives (such as methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE), motor oil, petroleum products and other hazardous materials released from aboveground or underground storage tanks or in connection with current or former operations conducted at our facilities. Some of the facilities on which we operate are impacted by recognized environmental concerns and pollution conditions. We have incurred and may in the future incur expenditures relating to compliance and risk mitigation efforts, releases of hazardous materials, investigative, remedial or corrective actions, claims by third parties and other environmental issues, and such expenditures, individually or in the aggregate, could be significant.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt, which could impair our financial condition and adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our total corporate debt was approximately $1.9 billion, exclusive of liabilities related to our securitization facilities which are not secured by the general assets of KAR, and we had $325.0 million of borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facilities. In addition, we had related outstanding letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $28.5 million at December 31, 2020, which would reduce the $325.0 million available for borrowings under the credit facilities.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences including:\n\u2022limiting our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy, acquisitions and other purposes;\n\u2022requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on debt, which would reduce the funds available for other purposes, including funding future expansion;\n\u2022making us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions, in government regulation and in our business by limiting our flexibility in planning for, and making it more difficult to react quickly to, changing conditions; and\n\u2022exposing us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because a portion of our indebtedness is at variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expenses in the event of increases in interest rates.\nIn addition, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations to service our debt and meet other cash needs, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, suspend or eliminate dividends, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to refinance our debt or sell additional debt or equity securities or our assets on favorable terms, if at all, particularly because of our high levels of debt and the restrictions imposed by the agreement governing our Credit Facility and the indenture governing our senior notes on our ability to incur additional debt and use the proceeds from asset sales. If we must sell certain of our assets, it may negatively affect our ability to generate revenue. The inability to obtain additional financing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we would be in default and, as a result, our debt holders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under our Credit Facility could terminate their commitments to lend us money and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nFurthermore, the agreement governing our Credit Facility and the indenture governing our senior notes include, and future debt instruments may include, certain restrictive covenants which could limit our ability to enter into certain transactions in the future and may adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nChanges to tax laws and other adverse outcomes with taxing authorities could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFrom time to time legislative proposals at the federal, state and international level are made that could, if enacted, make significant changes to the tax laws that apply to the Company, including changes to corporate tax rates, allocation of profits amongst jurisdictions and other changes that reduce or eliminate deductions currently available to us. Such proposed changes in tax laws, if adopted, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are also subject to the examination of our income tax and other returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and have a number of such reviews underway at any time. It is possible that tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, and an adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and operating results. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from such examinations, or changes in our effective tax rates, will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates or market conditions could adversely impact our profitability and business.\nRising interest rates may have the effect of depressing the sales of new and used vehicles because many consumers finance their vehicle purchases and rising auto loan rates increase the cost of purchasing a vehicle. Likewise, when interest rates increase, the subprime borrowing market often tightens, making interest rates even higher for those with lower credit scores. If increased interest rates depress the sales of new and/or used vehicles, then used vehicle trade-ins to dealers and auction volumes could be negatively impacted. These factors could adversely affect ADESA\u2019s revenues and profitability.\nIn addition, AFC securitizes a majority of its finance receivables on a revolving basis. Volatility and/or market disruption in the asset-backed securities market in the United States or Canada can impact AFC\u2019s cost of financing related to, or its ability to arrange financing on acceptable terms through, its securitization facility, which could negatively affect AFC\u2019s business and our financial condition and operations.\nAs noted elsewhere, a portion of our indebtedness is at variable rates of interest. As such, increases in interest rates could also result in higher interest expenses.\nWe assume the settlement risk for vehicles sold through our marketplaces.\nTypically, following the sale of a vehicle, we do not release the vehicle to a buyer until we have received full payment from the buyer or confirmation of arrangement for such payment. We may be obligated, however, to remit payment to a seller before receiving payment from a buyer, and, in those circumstances, we may not have recourse against sellers for any buyer\u2019s failure to satisfy its payment obligations. Revenue for a vehicle consigned to us for sale typically includes only the applicable buyer and seller fees associated with the transaction and not the vehicle sale proceeds. As a result, any failure to collect a receivable from the buyer in full may result in a loss up to the amount of the vehicle sale proceeds plus the applicable buyer fees and any collection related expenses. If we are unable to collect the vehicle sale price plus applicable buyer fees from buyers on a large number of vehicles, our revenue and cash flows may be negatively impacted resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to a complex framework of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including vehicle brokerage and auction laws and currency reporting obligations, which have in the past, and could in the future, subject us to claims, challenge our business model, or otherwise harm our business.\nOur operations are subject to regulation, supervision and licensing under various federal, state, provincial, local and foreign authorities, agencies, statutes and ordinances, which, among other things, require us to obtain and maintain certain licenses, permits and qualifications, provide certain disclosures and notices and limit interest rates, fees and other charges. The regulations and laws that impact our company include, without limitation, the following:\n\u2022The sale of used vehicles is regulated by various state and local motor vehicle departments and regulators.\n\u2022Some of the transport vehicles used at our facilities are regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation or similar regulatory agencies in the other locations in which we operate.\n\u2022AFC is subject to laws in certain states and provinces which regulate commercial lending activities and interest rates and, in certain jurisdictions, require AFC or one of its subsidiaries to be licensed.\n\u2022We are subject to various local zoning requirements with regard to the location of our auction and storage facilities, which requirements vary from location to location.\n\u2022We are subject to federal, state and international laws, directives and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, disclosure, security and transfer of personally identifiable information (e.g., GDPR and CCPA). These laws, directives, regulations and their interpretation and enforcement continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\n\u2022Certain of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries may be deemed subject to the regulations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 due to their vendor relationships with financial institutions.\n\u2022PAR is subject to laws in certain states which regulate repossession administration activities and, in certain jurisdictions, require PAR to be licensed.\n\u2022We deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations.\nChanges in law or governmental regulations or interpretations of existing law or regulations could result in increased costs, reduced vehicle prices and decreased profitability for us. In addition, failure to comply with present or future laws and regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or in their interpretation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks associated with legal and regulatory proceedings. If the outcomes of these proceedings are adverse to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future become, subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our current and past business operations, including but not limited to litigation claims and legal proceedings related to environmental, intellectual property, labor and employment, privacy, regulatory compliance, securities, tax, and tort laws. Such claims may be asserted against us by individuals, either individually or through class actions, by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations and proceedings or by other entities. These actions could expose us to adverse publicity and to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs, injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties, including but not limited to suspension or revocation of licenses to conduct business. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves in legal and administrative actions or in asserting our rights under various laws. In addition, we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or in asserting our rights in such actions. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, costly, and harmful to our reputation, and could require significant amounts of management time and corporate resources. If any of these legal proceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or be forced to change the way in which we operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe are partially self-insured for certain losses.\nWe self-insure a portion of employee medical benefits under the terms of our employee health insurance program, as well as a portion of our automobile, general liability and workers\u2019 compensation claims. We record an accrual for the claims expense related to our employee medical benefits, automobile, general liability and workers\u2019 compensation claims based upon the expected amount of all such claims. If actual trends, including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation above expectations were to occur, our self-insured costs would increase, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nWe depend on the continued and uninterrupted service from our workforce.\nPrior to 2018, none of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. In 2018, a group of employees, representing less than 1% of our total employees, entered into a collective bargaining agreement. If a significant number of our employees were to become unionized or collective bargaining agreement terms were to deviate significantly from our current compensation and benefits structure, we could be subject to a substantial increase in labor and benefits expenses that we may be unable to pass through to customers for some period of time, if at all.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets which, if they become impaired, would result in a reduction in our net income.\nGoodwill represents the amount by which the cost of an acquisition accounted for using the purchase method exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. Current accounting standards require that goodwill, as well as other intangible assets, be periodically evaluated for impairment based on their fair value. Goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant percentage of our total assets. Declines in our profitability or the value of comparable companies may impact the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in a write-down of goodwill or other intangible assets and a reduction in net income. In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we recorded $25.5 million of goodwill impairment and $4.3 million of impairment for customer relationships related to our ADESA Remarketing Limited reporting unit, and we may be required to record impairment charges in the future.\nNew accounting pronouncements or new interpretations of existing standards could require us to make adjustments to accounting policies that could adversely affect the financial statements.\nThe accounting for our business is complicated, particularly in the areas of revenue recognition and determining certain estimates, and is subject to change based on the advancement of our business model and interpretations of relevant accounting principles. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC, and other accounting organizations or governmental entities from time to time issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting and auditing standards that require changes to our accounting policies and procedures. Changes to our business model and accounting policies could result in changes to our financial statements and could require that we change how we process, analyze and report financial information and our financial reporting controls.\nRisks Related to the IAA Spin-Off\nIf the IAA spin-off does not qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company and its stockholders could be subject to substantial tax liabilities.\nIn connection with the spin-off of IAA, we received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS Ruling\") and an opinion from our tax counsel on the basis of certain facts, representations, covenants and assumptions, substantially to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the distribution of IAA common shares in the spin-off qualified as a transaction that generally is tax-free to us and our stockholders, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). The IRS Ruling and the opinion of tax counsel relied on, among other things, various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by the Company and IAA, which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, could jeopardize the conclusions reached in the IRS Ruling and opinion. The opinion is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), or the courts, and notwithstanding the tax opinion, there can be no assurance that the qualification of the spin-off as a transaction under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) or 355 or other provisions of the Code will not be challenged by the IRS or by others in court, or that any such challenge would not prevail. Notwithstanding the IRS Ruling and the opinion, the IRS could determine on audit that the spin-off should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the facts, assumptions, representations or covenants set forth in the tax opinion is not correct or has been violated, or that the spin-off should be taxable for other reasons, including as a result of a significant change in stock or asset ownership after the distribution, or if the IRS were to disagree with the conclusions of the tax opinion.\nIf the spin-off fails to qualify for tax-free treatment, we would, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, be treated as if we had sold the IAA common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and our stockholders would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the IAA common stock received in the distribution. In addition, we and/or IAA could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities or tax indemnification obligations, whether under applicable law or a tax matters agreement that we entered into with IAA, if it is ultimately determined that certain related transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-off are taxable.\nWe may be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the IAA spin-off, and IAA\u2019s indemnification obligations may not fully protect us.\nIn connection with the spin-off, IAA agreed to indemnify the Company for certain liabilities. However, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of any liabilities that may arise, or that IAA\nwill be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. The failure to receive amounts for which we are entitled to indemnification could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders and could expose us to securities class action litigation.\nYou should consider an investment in our common stock to be risky, and you should invest in our common stock only if you can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuations in the market value of your investment. Many factors could cause the market price of our common stock to rise and fall, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022our announcements or our competitors\u2019 announcements regarding new products or services, enhancements, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments;\n\u2022changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if any, who cover our common stock;\n\u2022results of operations that are below our announced guidance or below securities analysts\u2019 or consensus estimates or expectations;\n\u2022fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities, sales of large blocks of common stock by our stockholders or our incurrence of additional debt;\n\u2022repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program;\n\u2022investors\u2019 general perception of us and our industry;\n\u2022changes in general economic and market conditions (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic);\n\u2022changes in industry conditions; and\n\u2022changes in regulatory and other dynamics.\nIn addition, if the market for stocks in our industry, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if successfully defended, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management. Likewise, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation could be initiated. If such litigation were introduced against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe issuance of shares of our Series A Preferred Stock reduces the relative voting power of holders of our common stock, and the conversion and sale of those shares would dilute the ownership of such holders and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2020, 571,606 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock were outstanding, representing approximately 20% of our outstanding common stock, including the Series A Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to a cumulative dividend at the rate of 7% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. Dividends will be payable in kind through the issuance of additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock for the first eight dividend payment dates, and thereafter, in cash or in kind, or any combination thereof, at our option. Because holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, on an as-converted basis, together with holders of our common stock on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our common stock, the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock, and the subsequent issuance of additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock through the payment of in kind dividends, effectively reduces the relative voting power of the holders of our common stock. In addition, the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock into common stock would dilute the ownership interest of existing holders of our common stock. Furthermore, any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock would increase the number of shares of our common stock available for public trading, and could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. Pursuant to customary registration rights agreements, we are required to register for resale the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock. This registration facilitates the resale of such securities into the public market, and any such resale would increase the number of shares of our common stock available for public trading. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nApax and the other holders of our Series A Preferred Stock may exercise influence over us.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock represented approximately 20% of our outstanding common stock, including the Series A Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis. The terms of the Series A Preferred Stock require the approval of a majority of our Series A Preferred Stock by a separate class vote for us to:\n\u2022amend our organizational documents in a manner that would have an adverse effect on the Series A Preferred Stock; or\n\u2022issue securities that are senior to, or equal in priority with, the Series A Preferred Stock.\nIn addition, under our investment agreement, dated as of May 26, 2020 (the \u201cApax Investment Agreement\u201d), with an affiliate of Apax Partners, L.P. (\u201cApax\u201d), for so long as Apax and its affiliates beneficially own shares of Series A Preferred Stock (and/or shares of common stock issued upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock) that represent, on an as-converted basis, at least 50% of Apax\u2019s initial shares of Series A Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis, Apax and its affiliates will have the right to designate one director to our board of directors. Circumstances may occur in which the interests of Apax and its affiliates could diverge from, or even conflict with, the interests of our other stockholders. For example, the existence of Apax as a significant stockholder and Apax\u2019s board designation rights may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management or limiting the ability of our other stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in the best interests of the Company. Apax and its affiliates may seek to cause us to take courses of action that, in their judgment, could enhance its investment in the Company but which might involve risks to our other stockholders or adversely affect us or our other stockholders.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock has rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights of our common stockholders, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and may result in the interests of the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock differing from those of our common stockholders.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior to the shares of our common stock with respect to dividend rights and rights on the distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs. The holders of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to receive a liquidation preference entitling them to be paid out of our assets available for distribution to stockholders before any payment may be made to holders of any other class or series of capital stock, an amount equal to the greater of (a) the sum of the original liquidation preference plus all accrued but unpaid dividends or (b) the amount that such holder would have been entitled to receive upon our liquidation, dissolution and winding up if all outstanding shares of such series of Series A Preferred Stock had been converted into common stock immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In addition, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to a cumulative dividend at the rate of 7% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears (dividends are payable in kind for the first eight dividend payments, and thereafter in cash or in kind). The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are also entitled to participate in dividends declared or paid on our common stock on an as-converted basis. The holders of our Series A Preferred Stock also have the right, subject to certain exceptions, to require us to repurchase all or any portion of the Series A Preferred Stock upon certain change of control events at the greater of (a) the consideration the holders would have received if they had converted their shares of Series A Preferred Stock into common stock immediately prior to the change of control event and (b) 105% of the sum of i) the liquidation preference thereof and ii) all accrued but unpaid dividends.\nThese dividend and share repurchase obligations could impact our liquidity and reduce the amount of cash flows available for general corporate purposes. Our obligations to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. These preferential rights could also result in divergent interests between the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and holders of our common stock.\nFuture offerings of debt or equity securities, which would rank senior to our common stock, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf, in the future, we decide to issue debt or equity securities that rank senior to our common stock, it is likely that such securities will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may result in dilution to owners of our common stock. We and, indirectly, our stockholders, will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings in us.\nThe market price of our common stock could be negatively affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market.\nFuture sales by us or by our existing stockholders of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. These sales also could impede our ability to raise future capital. Under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we are authorized to issue up to 400,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 129,700,156 shares of common stock were outstanding as of December 31, 2020. In addition, pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act, we have registered shares of common stock reserved for issuance in respect of stock options and other incentive awards granted to our officers and certain of our employees. If any of these holders cause a large number of securities to be sold in the public market, including common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock. We cannot predict the size of future sales of shares of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future sales, or the perception that such sales may occur, would have on the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that may be considered to have an anti-takeover effect and may delay or prevent a tender offer or other corporate transaction that a stockholder might consider to be in its best interest, including those transactions that might result in a premium over the market price for our shares.\nThese provisions include:\n\u2022rules regarding how our stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022permitting our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022granting to the board of directors, and not the stockholders, the sole power to set the number of directors;\n\u2022authorizing vacancies on our board of directors to be filled only by a vote of the majority of the directors then in office and specifically denying our stockholders the right to fill vacancies in the board;\n\u2022authorizing the removal of directors only upon the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote for the election of directors; and\n\u2022prohibiting stockholder action by written consent.\nThese provisions apply even if an offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders.\nYou may not receive any future dividends on our common stock.\nHolders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We are not required to declare cash dividends on our common stock. Future dividend decisions will be based on and affected by a variety of factors, including our financial condition and results of operations, contractual restrictions, including restrictive covenants contained in our Credit Agreement, the indenture governing our senior notes and AFC\u2019s securitization facilities, capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. Therefore, no assurance can be given as to whether any future dividends may be declared by our board of directors or the amount thereof.\nOur share repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility. In addition, it may be suspended or discontinued at any time, which could result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.\nIn October 2019, our board of directors authorized a repurchase of up to $300 million of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock through October 30, 2021. Repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program, or any future share repurchase program, could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a share repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. There can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased the shares of common stock. Although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program's effectiveness. Furthermore, the program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline.", "PERMNO": 93174, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "KAR"}
