{"cik": "1647088", "company": "WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe may be unable to successfully acquire and integrate new operations, including Mobile Mini and our conversion to its enterprise resource planning system, which could cause our business to suffer.\nWe may be unable to successfully make strategic acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses or assets into our operations, including Mobile Mini, for various reasons. We completed the Mobile Mini Merger on July 1, 2020. While the Mobile Mini integration is underway, we may explore other acquisitions in the future that meet our strategic growth plans.\nIn particular, we are engaged in a conversion of the Company\u2019s legacy enterprise resource planning system (\"ERP\") to Mobile Mini\u2019s ERP. The ERP is designed to accurately maintain the company\u2019s books and records and provide information important to the operation of the business to the company\u2019s management team. The Company\u2019s ERP conversion will continue to require significant investment of human and financial resources. In implementing the ERP, we may experience significant delays, increased costs and other difficulties. Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the ERP could adversely affect our ability to process orders, deliver units, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business. While we have invested significant resources in planning and project management, significant implementation issues may arise which could significantly impact our operations and financial performance.\nAdditionally, we cannot predict if or when acquisitions will be completed, and we may face significant competition for acquisition targets. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from normal daily operations of the business;\n\u2022loss of key employees;\n\u2022difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and where our competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;\n\u2022difficulties in complying with regulations, such as environmental regulations, and managing risks related to an acquired business;\n\u2022an inability to timely obtain financing, including any amendments required to existing financing agreements;\n\u2022an inability to implement uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022undiscovered and unknown problems, defects, liabilities or other issues related to any acquisition that become known to us only after the acquisition, particularly relating to rental equipment on lease that are unavailable for inspection during the diligence process; and\n\u2022loss of key customers, suppliers or employees.\nIn connection with acquisitions, we may assume liabilities or acquire damaged assets, some of which may be unknown to us at the time of such acquisitions.\nWe assess the condition and regulatory certification of an acquired fleet as part of our acquisition due diligence. In some cases, fleet condition or regulatory certification may be difficult to determine due to the fleet being on lease at the time of acquisition and/or inadequate certification records. Fleet acquisitions may therefore result in a rectification cost that we may not have factored into the acquisition price, impacting deployability and ultimate profitability of the fleet we acquired.\nWe must continue to take actions to realize the combined cost synergies that we forecast for the acquisition. We may incur more costs than we anticipated to achieve the forecast synergies (thus reducing the net benefit of the cost synergies), realize synergies later than we expected or fail altogether to achieve a portion of the cost savings we anticipated. Any of these events could cause reductions in our earnings per share, impact our ability to borrow funds under our credit facility, decrease or delay the accretive effect of the acquisitions that we anticipated and negatively impact our stock price.\nAcquisitions are inherently risky, and we cannot provide assurance that the Mobile Mini Merger, or any future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we do not manage new markets effectively, some of our new branches and acquisitions may lose money or fail, and we may have to close unprofitable branches. Closing a branch in such circumstances would likely result in additional expenses that would cause our operating results to suffer. To manage growth successfully, we will need to continue to identify additional qualified managers and employees to integrate acquisitions within our established operating, financial and other internal procedures and controls. We will also need to effectively motivate, train and manage our employees. Failure to successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions and new branches into existing operations could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nGlobal or local economic movements could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business, which operates in the US, Canada, Mexico and the UK, may be negatively impacted by economic movements or downturns in the local markets in which we operate or global markets generally. These adverse economic conditions may reduce commercial activity, cause disruption and extreme volatility in global financial markets and increase rates of default and bankruptcy. Reduced commercial activity has historically resulted in reduced demand for our products and services. For example, reduced commercial activity in the construction, energy and natural resources sectors in certain markets in which we operate, particularly the US and Canada, has negatively impacted our business in the past. Disruptions in financial markets could negatively impact the ability of our customers to pay their obligations to us in a timely manner and increase our counterparty risk. If economic conditions worsen, we may face reduced demand and an increase, relative to historical levels, in the time it takes to receive customer payments. If we are not able to adjust our business in a timely and effective manner to changing economic conditions, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nMoreover, the level of demand for our products and services is sensitive to the level of demand within various sectors, particularly the commercial and industrial, construction, education, energy and natural resources, and government end markets. Each of these sectors is influenced not only by the state of the general global economy, but also by a number of more specific factors as well. For example, a decline in global or local energy prices may materially adversely affect demand for modular buildings within the energy and resources sector. The levels of activity in these sectors and geographic regions may also be cyclical, and we may not be able to predict the timing, extent or duration of the activity cycles in the markets in which we or our key customers operate. A decline or slowed growth in any of these sectors or geographic regions could result in reduced demand for our products and services, which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are exposed to operational, economic, political and regulatory risks.\nWe operate in the US, Canada, Mexico and the UK. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 89.8%, 5.8%, 1.0%, and 3.4% of our revenue was generated in the US, Canada, Mexico and the UK, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 76.9%, 16.2%, 3.4%, and 3.5% of our revenue was derived from our NA Modular Solutions business, NA Storage Solutions business, UK Storage Solutions business and Tank and Pump Solutions business, respectively.\nOur operations in any of these countries could be affected by foreign and domestic economic, political and regulatory risks, including the following:\n\u2022regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict our ability to assemble, lease or sell products;\n\u2022inflation, recession, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates;\n\u2022trade protection measures, including increased duties and taxes and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022compliance with applicable antitrust and other regulatory rules and regulations relating to potential acquisitions;\n\u2022different local product preferences and product requirements;\n\u2022pressures on management time and attention due to the complexities of overseeing multi-national operations;\n\u2022challenges in maintaining staffing;\n\u2022different labor regulations and the potential impact of collective bargaining;\n\u2022potentially adverse consequences from changes in, or interpretations of, tax laws;\n\u2022political and economic instability;\n\u2022enforcement of remedies in various jurisdictions;\n\u2022the risk that the business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance will not perform as expected;\n\u2022compliance with applicable export control laws and economic sanctions laws and regulations;\n\u2022price controls and ownership regulations;\n\u2022obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash;\n\u2022differences in business practices that may result in violation of company policies, including, but not limited to, bribery and collusive practices; and\n\u2022reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries.\nThese and other risks may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations may be adversely impacted as a result of COVID-19.\nAs a result of the ongoing global pandemic, governments around the world have implemented quarantines and significant restrictions on travel as well as work restrictions that prohibit many employees from going to work. As millions of cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed around the world, we expect COVID-19 to continue to impact general commercial activity related to our supply chain and customer base, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or result of operations. To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic continues, worsens, or vaccines are delayed, governments may impose additional restrictions or additional governments may impose restrictions. COVID-19 and those restrictions could result in additional businesses being shut down, additional work restrictions and supply chains being interrupted, slowed, or rendered inoperable. As a result, it may be challenging to obtain and process raw materials to support our business needs, we may need to recognize material charges in future periods for impairments of our rental equipment, property, plant, and equipment and/or intangible assets. Furthermore, our employees, suppliers or customers could become ill, quarantined or otherwise unable to work and/or travel due to health reasons or governmental restrictions. The COVID-19 global pandemic has affected and may continue to affect our industry and the industries in which our customers operate, and there may be an adverse impact on customer demand for our rentals. We also have been, and will be, adversely impacted by project delays, early returns of equipment on rent with customers and payment delay, or non-payment, by customers who are significantly impacted by COVID-19. If our customers\u2019 businesses continue to be affected, they might delay or reduce purchases from or payments to us, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, increased volatility and diminished expectations for the global economy, coupled with the prospect of decreased business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, may precipitate an economic slowdown and recession. If the economic climate deteriorates, our ability to continue to grow our business organically or through additional acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses, as well as the financial condition of customers, suppliers and lenders, could be adversely affected, resulting in a negative impact on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of our company.\nThe situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid. A delay in wide distribution of a vaccine, or a lack of public acceptance of a vaccine, could lead people to continue to self-isolate and not participate in the economy at pre-pandemic levels for a prolonged period of time. Further, even if a vaccine is widely distributed and accepted, there can be no assurance that the vaccine will ultimately be successful in limiting or stopping the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, it remains difficult to predict the potential impact of the virus on our results of operations and financial position. The potential effects of COVID-19 also could impact many of our risk factors, as discussed herein, including, but not limited to our exposure to operational, economic, political and regulatory risks; risks related to global or local economic movements; changes in trade policies; and labor disruptions. However, given the evolving health, economic, social, and governmental environments, the potential impact that COVID-19 could have on our risk factors that are further described herein remains uncertain. Any future pandemics could similarly negatively impact our operations and financial results.\nAny failure of our management information systems could disrupt our business operations both in the field and back office, which could result in decreased lease or sale revenue and increase overhead costs.\nWe rely heavily on information systems across our operations. We also utilize third-party cloud providers to host certain of our applications and to store data. Our ability to effectively manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of our management information systems to perform as anticipated could damage our reputation with our customers, disrupt our business or result in, among other things, decreased lease and sales revenue and increased overhead costs. Any such failure could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the delay or failure to implement information system upgrades and new systems effectively could disrupt our business, distract management\u2019s focus and attention from business operations and growth initiatives and increase our implementation and operating costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our operations and operating results.\nWe believe we have implemented appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks; however, like other companies, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions due to our own error or events beyond our control. The measures that we employ to protect our systems may not detect or prevent cybersecurity breaches, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunication failures, computer viruses, hackers, phishing attacks, and other security issues. We have previously been the target of an attempted cyber-attack and have from time to time experienced threats to our data\nand systems, computer virus attacks and phishing attempts, and we may be subject to breaches of the information systems that we use. We have not experienced a material cybersecurity breach. We have programs in place that are intended to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents and that provide employee awareness training regarding phishing, malware, and other cyber risks to protect against cyber risks and security breaches. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, because our systems contain information about individuals and other businesses, the failure to maintain the security of the data we hold, whether the result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others, could harm our reputation or give rise to legal liabilities leading to lower revenue, increased costs, regulatory sanctions and other potential material adverse effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nEffective management of our fleet is vital to our business, and our failure to properly safeguard, design, manufacture, repair and maintain our fleet could harm our business and reduce our operating results and cash flows.\nOur modular space and portable storage units have long economic lives and managing our fleet is a critical element to our leasing business. Rental equipment asset management requires designing and building long-lived products that anticipate customer needs and changes in legislation, regulations, building codes and local permitting in the various markets in which we operate. In addition, we must cost-effectively maintain and repair our fleet to maximize the economic life of the products and the proceeds we receive from product sales. As the needs of our customers change, we may incur costs to relocate or retrofit our assets to better meet shifts in demand. If the distribution of our assets is not aligned with regional demand, we may be unable to take advantage of sales and leasing opportunities in certain regions, despite excess inventory in other regions. If we are not able to successfully manage our lease assets, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we do not appropriately manage the design, manufacture, repair and maintenance of our product fleet, or if we delay or defer such repair or maintenance or suffer unexpected losses of rental equipment due to theft or obsolescence, we may be required to incur impairment charges for equipment that is beyond economic repair or incur significant capex to acquire new rental equipment to serve demand. These failures may also result in personal injury or property damage claims, including claims based on poor indoor air quality and termination of leases or contracts by customers. Costs of contract performance, potential litigation and profits lost from termination could materially adversely affect our future operating results and cash flows.\nTrade policies and changes in trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs, their enforcement and downstream consequences, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and outlook.\nTariffs and/or other developments with respect to trade policies, trade agreements and government regulations may materially, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the US government has imposed tariffs on steel, aluminum and lumber imports from certain countries, which could result in increased costs to us for these materials. Without limitation, (i) tariffs currently in place and (ii) the imposition by the federal government of new tariffs on imports to the US could materially increase (a) the cost of our products that we are offering for sale or lease, (b) the cost of certain products that we source from foreign manufacturers, and (c) the cost of certain raw materials or products that we utilize. We may not be able to pass such increased costs on to our customers, and we may not be able to secure sources of certain products and materials that are not subject to tariffs on a timely basis. Although we actively monitor our procurement policies and practices to avoid undue reliance on foreign-sourced goods subject to tariffs, when practicable, such developments may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face significant competition in the modular space, portable storage and tank and pump industries. Such competition may result in pricing pressure or an inability to maintain or grow our market share. If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose customers and our revenue and profitability could decline.\nAlthough our competition varies significantly by market, the modular space, portable storage, and the tank and pump solutions industries are highly competitive, in general, and the portable storage and tank and pump solutions industries are highly fragmented. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including customer relationships, product quality and availability, delivery speed, VAPS and service capabilities, pricing, and overall ease of doing business. We may experience pricing pressures in our operations as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices, and we may face reduced demand for our products and services if our competitors are able to provide new or innovative products or services that better appeal to customers. In most of our end markets, we face competition from national, regional and local companies who have an established market position in the specific service area, and we expect to encounter similar competition in any new markets that we may enter. In certain markets, some of our competitors may have greater market share, less debt, greater pricing flexibility, more attractive product or service offerings, better brand recognition or superior marketing and financial resources. Increased competition could result in lower profit margins, substantial pricing pressure and reduced market share. Price competition, together with other forms of competition, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we do not manage our credit risk effectively, collect on our accounts receivable, or recover our rental equipment from our customers, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe perform credit evaluation procedures on our customers on each transaction and require security deposits or other forms of security from our customers when we identify a significant credit risk. Failure to manage our credit risk and receive timely payments on our customer accounts receivable may result in the write-off of customer receivables and loss of units if we are unable to recover our rental equipment from our customers\u2019 sites. If we are not able to manage credit risk, or if a large number of customers should have financial difficulties at the same time, our credit and rental equipment losses would increase above historical levels. If this should occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nWe intend to continue to launch operations into new geographic markets and/or add other business unit operations in existing markets, which may be costly and may not be successful.\nWillScot and Mobile Mini have in the past, and we intend in the future, to expand our Modular Space, Storage Solutions and Tank and Pump Solutions operations into new geographic markets in North America. This expansion could require financial resources that would not therefore be available for other aspects of our business. In addition, this expansion could require the time and attention of management, leaving less time to focus on existing business. If we fail to manage the risks inherent in our geographic expansion, we could incur capital and operating costs without any related increase in revenue, which would harm our operating results.\nChanges in state building codes could adversely impact our ability to remarket our buildings, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBuilding codes are generally reviewed, debated and, in certain cases, modified on a national level every three years as an ongoing effort to keep the regulations current and improve the life, safety and welfare of the building\u2019s occupants. All aspects of a given code are subject to change, including, but not limited to, such items as structural specifications for earthquake safety, energy efficiency and environmental standards, fire and life safety, transportation, lighting and noise limits. On occasion, state agencies have undertaken studies of indoor air quality and noise levels with a focus on permanent and modular classrooms. This process leads to a systematic change that requires engagement in the process and recognition that past methods will not always be accepted. New modular construction is very similar to conventional construction where newer codes and regulations generally increase cost. New governmental regulations may increase our costs to acquire new rental equipment, as well as increase our costs to refurbish existing equipment.\nCompliance with building codes and regulations entails risk as state and local government authorities do not necessarily interpret building codes and regulations in a consistent manner, particularly where applicable regulations may be unclear and subject to interpretation. These regulations often provide broad discretion to governmental authorities that oversee these matters, which can result in unanticipated delays or increases in the cost of compliance in particular markets. The construction and modular industries have developed many \u201cbest practices\u201d which are constantly evolving. Some of our peers and competitors may adopt practices that are more or less stringent than ours. When, and if, regulators clarify regulatory standards, the effect of the clarification may be to impose rules on our business and practices retroactively, at which time we may not be in compliance with such regulations and we may be required to incur costly remediation. If we are unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers, our business, financial condition, operating cash flows and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nOur operations face foreign currency exchange rate exposure, which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe hold assets, incur liabilities, earn revenue and pay expenses in certain currencies other than the US Dollar, primarily the Canadian Dollar, the Mexican Peso and the British Pound. Our consolidated financial results are denominated in US Dollars, and therefore, during times of a strengthening US Dollar, our reported revenue in non-US Dollar jurisdictions will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer US Dollars. Revenue and expenses are translated into US Dollars at the average exchange rate for the period. In addition, the assets and liabilities of our non-US Dollar subsidiaries are translated into US Dollars at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. Foreign currency exchange adjustments arising from certain intercompany obligations with and between our domestic companies and our foreign subsidiaries are marked-to-market and recorded as a non-cash loss or gain in each of our financial periods in our consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, changes in currency exchange rates will cause our foreign currency translation adjustment in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) to fluctuate. In addition, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the amount of US Dollars we receive when we repatriate funds from our non-US Dollar operations.\nFluctuations in interest rates and commodity prices may also materially adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlthough we have converted a portion of our senior secured revolving credit facility borrowings into fixed-rate debt through interest rate swaps, a significant portion of our borrowings under the facility remain variable rate debt. Fluctuations in interest rates may negatively impact the amount of interest payments, as well as our ability to refinance portions of our existing debt in the future at attractive interest rates. In addition, certain of our end markets, as well as portions of our cost structure,\nsuch as transportation costs, are sensitive to changes in commodity prices, which can impact both demand for and profitability of our services. These changes could impact our future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant.\nSignificant increases in raw material and labor costs could increase our operating costs significantly and harm our profitability.\nWe incur labor costs and purchase raw materials, including steel, lumber, siding and roofing, paint, glass, fuel and other products to perform periodic repairs, modifications and refurbishments to maintain physical conditions of our units and in connection with get-ready, delivery and installation of our units. The volume, timing and mix of such work may vary quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Generally, increases in labor and raw material costs will increase the acquisition costs of new units and also increase the repair and maintenance costs of our fleet. We also maintain a truck fleet to deliver units to and return units from our customers, the cost of which is sensitive to maintenance and fuel costs and rental rates on leased equipment. During periods of rising prices for labor or raw materials, and in particular, when the prices increase rapidly or to levels significantly higher than normal, we may incur significant increases in our acquisition costs for new units and higher operating costs that we may not be able to recoup from customers through changes in pricing, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If raw material prices decline significantly, we may have to write down our raw materials inventory values. If this happens, our results of operations and financial condition could decline.\nFluctuations in fuel costs or oil prices, a reduction in fuel supplies, or a sustained decline in oil prices may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn connection with our business, to better serve our customers and limit our capex, we often move our fleet from branch to branch. In addition, the majority of our customers arrange for delivery and pickup of our units through us. Accordingly, we could be materially adversely affected by significant increases in fuel prices that result in higher costs to us for transporting equipment. In the event of fuel and trucking cost increases, we may not be able to promptly raise our prices to make up for increased costs. A significant or prolonged price fluctuation or disruption of fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, oil prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. If oil prices remain volatile for an extended period of time or there is a sustained decline in demand for oil, demand for our Tank and Pump Solutions products from refineries and companies engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas could be adversely impacted, which would in turn have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThird parties may fail to manufacture or provide necessary components for our products properly or in a timely manner.\nWe are often dependent on third parties to manufacture or supply components for our products. We typically do not enter into long-term contracts with third-party suppliers. We may experience supply problems as a result of financial or operating difficulties or the failure or consolidation of our suppliers. We may also experience supply problems as a result of shortages and discontinuations resulting from product obsolescence or other shortages or allocations by suppliers. Unfavorable economic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers or the terms on which we purchase products. In the future, we may not be able to negotiate arrangements with third parties to secure products that we require in sufficient quantities or on reasonable terms. If we cannot negotiate arrangements with third parties to produce our products or if the third parties fail to produce our products to our specifications or in a timely manner, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to risks associated with labor relations, labor costs and labor disruptions.\nWe are subject to the costs and risks generally associated with labor disputes and organizing activities related to unionized labor. From time to time, strikes, public demonstrations or other coordinated actions and publicity may disrupt our operations. We may incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of contractual disputes, negotiations or other labor-related disruptions. We have collective bargaining agreements with employees in portions of our Mexico-based operations, which accounted for approximately 2.0% of our total employees as of December 31, 2020. These operations may be more highly affected by labor force activities than others, and all collective bargaining agreements must be renegotiated annually. Other locations may also face organizing activities or effects. Labor organizing activities could result in additional employees becoming unionized. Furthermore, collective bargaining agreements may limit our ability to reduce the size of work forces during an economic downturn, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. We believe a unionized workforce outside of Mexico would generally increase our operating costs, divert attention of management from servicing customers and increase the risk of work stoppages, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nFailure to retain key personnel could impede our ability to execute our business plan and growth strategy.\nOur ability to profitably execute our business plan depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel. Certain of our key executives, managers and employees have knowledge and an understanding of our business and our industry, and/or have developed meaningful customer relationships, that cannot be duplicated readily. Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel is dependent on, among other things, the availability of qualified personnel and our ability to provide a competitive compensation package, including the implementation of adequate drivers of retention and rewards\nbased on performance, and work environment. Failure to retain qualified key personnel may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The departure of any key personnel and our inability to enforce non-competition agreements could have a negative impact on our business.\nMoreover, labor shortages, the inability to hire or retain qualified employees and increased labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to control expenses and efficiently conduct our operations. We may not be able to continue to hire and retain the sufficiently skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our operating strategies. Labor expenses could also increase as a result of continuing shortages in the supply of personnel.\nIf we determine that our goodwill, intangible assets, and indefinite-life intangible assets have become impaired, we may incur impairment charges, which may adversely impact our operating results.\nWe have a substantial amount of goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets (trade names), which represents the excess of the total purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of the assets acquired, and other intangible assets. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $1,171.2 million and $495.9 million of goodwill and intangible assets, net, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets, which represented approximately 21.0% and 9.0% of total assets, respectively, and primarily arose through our acquisition of Mobile Mini.\nWe test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and when events occur or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset may be below its carrying amount. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to inherent uncertainties and changes in estimates and assumptions regarding revenue growth rates, EBIT margins, capex, working capital requirements, tax rates, terminal growth rates, discount rates, exchange rates, royalty rates, benefits associated with a taxable transaction and synergistic benefits available to market participants. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the performance of the business, adverse market conditions, stock price and adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations, including changes that restrict our activities. Declines in market conditions, a trend of weaker than anticipated financial performance for our reporting units or declines in projected revenue, a decline in our share price for a sustained period of time, an increase in the market-based weighted average cost of capital or a decrease in royalty rates, among other factors, are indicators that the carrying value of our goodwill or indefinite-life intangible assets may not be recoverable. These risks may be heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the event impairment is identified, a charge to earnings would be recorded which may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had US net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards of approximately $1,187.5 million and $700.5 million for US federal income tax and state tax purposes, respectively, available to offset future taxable income, prior to consideration of annual limitations that Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 may impose. The US NOL carryforwards begin to expire in 2021 for state and 2022 for federal if not utilized. In addition, we had foreign NOLs of $14.1 million as a result of operations in Canada and Mexico. Our Mexico and Canadian NOL carryforwards begin to expire in 2025 and 2038, respectively, if not utilized.\nOur US NOL and tax credit carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and corresponding provisions of US state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its US NOLs and other applicable tax attributes before the ownership change, such as research and development tax credits, to offset its income after the ownership change may be limited. We have completed Section 382 analysis for the Mobile Mini Merger. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-Mobile Mini Merger US NOL carryforwards to offset US federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of US NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nLastly, we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If we determine that an ownership change has occurred and our ability to use our historical NOL and tax credit carryforwards is materially limited, it may result in increased future tax obligations and income tax expense.\nSome of the tax loss carryforwards could expire, and if we do not have sufficient taxable income in future years to use the tax benefits before they expire, the benefit may be permanently lost. In addition, the taxing authorities could challenge our calculation of the amount of our tax attributes, which could reduce certain of our recognized tax benefits. Further, tax laws in certain jurisdictions may limit the ability to use carryforwards upon a change in control.\nWe may be unable to recognize deferred tax assets such as those related to our tax loss carryforwards and, as a result, lose future tax savings, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and financial position.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets primarily related to deductible temporary differences based on our assessment that the item will be utilized against future taxable income and the benefit will be sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority. Such deductible temporary differences primarily relate to tax loss carryforwards and business interest expense limitations. Tax loss carryforwards arising in a given tax jurisdiction may be carried forward to offset taxable\nincome in future years from such tax jurisdiction and reduce or eliminate income taxes otherwise payable on such taxable income, subject to certain limitations. Deferred interest expense exists primarily within our US operating companies, where interest expense was not previously deductible as incurred but may become deductible in the future subject to certain limitations. We may have to write down, through income tax expense, the carrying amount of certain deferred tax assets to the extent we determine it is not probable we will realize such deferred tax assets under US GAAP.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax obligations, the adoption of a new tax legislation, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the US, Canada, Mexico and the UK. Our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charged for inventory, services, funding and other transactions on an intercompany basis. We are subject to potential tax examinations in these jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other tax positions and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these potential examinations, and the amounts that we ultimately pay upon resolution of examinations could be materially different from the amounts we previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. Changes in tax laws or regulations, including changes in the US related to the treatment of accelerated depreciation expense, carry-forwards of net operating losses, and taxation of foreign income and expenses may increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations, including those governing government contracts, corruption and the environment. Obligations and liabilities under these laws and regulations may materially harm our business.\nGovernment Contract Laws and Regulations\nWe lease and sell our products to government entities, and this subjects us to statutes and regulations applicable to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts can differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain favorable pricing terms and conditions that are not typically included in private contracts, such as clauses that make certain obligations of government entities subject to budget appropriations. Many government contracts can be terminated or modified, in whole or in part, at any time, without penalty, by the government. In addition, our failure to comply with these laws and regulations might result in administrative penalties or the suspension of our government contracts or debarment and, as a result, the loss of the related revenue which would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are not aware of any action contemplated by any regulatory authority related to any possible non-compliance by or in connection with our operations.\nOur operations are subject to an array of governmental regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. For example, our activities in the US are subject to regulation by several federal and state government agencies, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and by federal and state laws. Our operations and activities in other jurisdictions are subject to similar governmental regulations. Similar to conventionally constructed buildings, the modular business industry is also subject to regulations by multiple governmental agencies in each jurisdiction relating to, among others, environmental, zoning and building standards, and health, safety and transportation matters. These regulations affect our Storage Solutions and Tank and Pump Solutions customers, most of whom use our storage units to store their goods on their own properties for various lengths of time. If local zoning laws or planning permission regulations in one or more of our markets no longer allow our units to be stored on customers' sites, our business in that market will suffer. Noncompliance with applicable regulations, implementation of new regulations or modifications to existing regulations may increase costs of compliance, require a termination of certain activities or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUS Government Contract Laws and Regulations\nOur government customers include the US government, which means we are subject to various statutes and regulations applicable to doing business with the US government. These types of contracts customarily contain provisions that give the US government substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts and which are unfavorable to contractors, including provisions that allow the government to unilaterally terminate or modify our federal government contracts, in whole or in part, at the government\u2019s convenience. Under general principles of US government contracting law, if the government terminates a contract for convenience, the terminated company may generally recover only its incurred or committed costs and settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the government terminates a contract for default, the defaulting company may be liable for any extra costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items from another source.\nIn addition, US government contracts and grants normally contain additional requirements that may increase our costs of doing business, reduce our profits, and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions. These requirements include, for example:\n\u2022 specialized disclosure and accounting requirements unique to US government contracts;\n\u2022financial and compliance audits that may result in potential liability for price adjustments, recoupment of government funds after such funds have been spent, civil and criminal penalties, or administrative sanctions such as suspension or debarment from doing business with the US government;\n\u2022public disclosures of certain contract and company information; and\n\u2022mandatory socioeconomic compliance requirements, including labor requirements, non-discrimination and affirmative action programs and environmental compliance requirements.\nIf we fail to comply with these requirements, our contracts may be subject to termination, and we may be subject to financial and/or other liability under our contracts or under the Federal Civil False Claims Act (the \"False Claims Act\"). The False Claims Act\u2019s \u201cwhistleblower\u201d provisions allow private individuals, including present and former employees, to sue on behalf of the US government. The False Claims Act statute provides for treble damages and other penalties, and if our operations are found to be in violation of the False Claims Act, we could face other adverse action, including suspension or prohibition from doing business with the US government. Any penalties, damages, fines, suspension or damages could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nDepartment of Transportation Regulations\nWe operate in the US pursuant to operating authority granted by the US Department of Transportation (the \u201cDOT\u201d). Our drivers must comply with the safety and fitness regulations of the DOT, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours of service. Such matters as equipment weight and dimensions are also subject to government regulations. Our safety record could be ranked poorly compared to peer firms. A poor safety ranking may result in the loss of customers or difficulty attracting and retaining qualified drivers which could affect our results of operations. Should additional rules be enacted in the future, compliance with such rules could result in additional costs.\nAnti-Corruption Laws and Regulations\nWe are subject to various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials by a US person for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We operate in countries that may present a more corruptible business environment than the US Such activities create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of various laws, including the FCPA. We have implemented safeguards and policies to discourage these practices by our employees and agents. However, existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be ineffective and employees or agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible.\nIf employees violate our policies or we fail to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions, we may be subject to regulatory sanctions. Violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties, including suspension or debarment from US government contracting, and we may be subject to other liabilities which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are also subject to similar anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions.\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations\nWe are subject to a variety of national, state, regional and local environmental laws and regulations. Among other things, these laws and regulations impose limitations and prohibitions on the discharge and emission of, and establish standards for the use, disposal and management of, regulated materials and waste and impose liabilities for the costs of investigating and cleaning up, and damages resulting from, present and past spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous substances or materials. In the ordinary course of business, we use and generate substances that are regulated or may be hazardous under environmental laws. We have an inherent risk of liability under environmental laws and regulations, both with respect to ongoing operations and with respect to contamination that may have occurred in the past on our properties or as a result of our operations. For example, we own, transport and rent tanks and boxes in which waste materials are placed by our customers. Although we have a policy which, with certain limited exceptions, requires customers to return tanks and containers clean of any substances, they may fail to comply with these obligations. Additionally, we may provide waste hauling services, which involves environmental risks during transport. While we endeavor to comply with all regulatory requirements, from time to time, our operations or conditions on properties that we have acquired have resulted in liabilities under these environmental laws. We may in the future incur material costs to comply with environmental laws or sustain material liabilities from claims concerning noncompliance or contamination. Under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at, or migration to or from, our or our predecessors' past or present facilities. These laws often impose liability even if the owner, operator or lessor did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. We have no reserves for any such liabilities.\nWe are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. If we violate or fail to obtain or comply with these laws, regulations, or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We could also become liable if employees or other parties are improperly exposed to hazardous materials.\nIn addition, ongoing governmental review of hydraulic fracturing (\u201cfracking\u201d) and its environmental impact could lead to changes to this activity or its substantial curtailment, which could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. Approximately 2% of our consolidated rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was related to customers involved in the upstream exploration and production of oil and natural gas. A portion of this revenue involves rentals to customers that use the fracking method to extract natural gas. The US Environmental Protection Agency has issued regulations or guidance regarding certain aspects of the process. Other federal, state and local governments and\ngovernmental agencies also investigate and/or regulate fracking. Additional governmental regulation could result in increased costs of compliance or the curtailment of fracking in the future, which would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nWe cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted, or what environmental conditions may be found to exist at our facilities or at third party sites for which we may be liable. Enactment of stricter laws or regulations, stricter interpretations of existing laws and regulations or the requirement to undertake the investigation or remediation of currently unknown environmental contamination at sites we own or third-party sites may require us to make additional expenditures, some of which could be material.\nOur customer base includes customers operating in a variety of industries which may be subject to changes in their competitive environment as a result of the global, national or local economic climate in which they operate and/or economic or financial disruptions to their industry.\nOur customer base includes customers operating in a variety of industries, including commercial and industrial, construction, education, energy and natural resources, government, retail and other end markets. Many of these customers, across this wide range of industries, are facing economic and/or financial pressure from changes to their industry resulting from the global, national and local economic climate in which they operate and industry-specific economic and financial disruptions, including, in some cases, consolidation and lower sales revenue from physical locations, resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related changes in political, social and economic conditions. These and any future changes to any of the industries in which our customers operate could cause them to rent fewer units from us or otherwise be unable to satisfy their obligations to us. In addition, certain of our customers are facing financial pressure and such pressure, from COVID-19 or other factors, may result in consolidation in some industries and/or an increase in bankruptcy filings by certain customers. Each of these facts and industry impacts, individually or in the aggregate, could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur operational measures designed to increase revenue while continuing to control operating costs may not generate the expected improvements and efficiencies and may not drive growth or returns.\nWe continually initiate new operational processes designed to increase revenue while continuing to pursue our strategy of reducing operating costs where available. Additionally, we employ a hybrid sales strategy of using local sales people in addition to a centralized call center team designed to meet customer needs and drive revenue growth. However, no assurance can be given that these strategies will achieve the desired goals and efficiencies in the future. The success of these strategies is somewhat dependent on a number of factors that are beyond our control.\nEven if we carry out these processes in the manner we currently expect, we may not achieve the improvements or efficiencies we anticipate, or on the timetable we anticipate. There may be unforeseen productivity, revenue or other consequences resulting from our strategies that will adversely affect us or impact our strategies for asset management. Therefore, there can be no guarantee that our strategies will prove effective in achieving desired profitability, margins, or returns on capital employed. Additionally, these strategies may have adverse consequences if our cost cutting and operational changes are deemed by customers to adversely impact product quality or service levels.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends in part upon protection of our rights in trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights we own or license, including patents to the Mobile Mini locking system. Our use of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and agreements, and trademark, copyright, unfair competition, trade secret and other laws to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights may not be adequate. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information and patents, or to defend against claims by third parties that our services or our use of intellectual property infringe their intellectual property rights. Any litigation or claims brought by or against us could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. A successful claim of trademark, copyright or other intellectual property infringement against us could prevent us from providing services, which could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, a breakdown in our internal policies and procedures may lead to an unintentional disclosure of our proprietary, confidential or material non-public information, which could in turn harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions, which could materially adversely affect our information systems, future revenue, financial condition, cash flows and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions such as pandemics, fires, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes and terrorism, which could adversely affect our information systems, future revenue, financial condition, and cash flows and increase our costs and expenses. See \"Our operations may be adversely impacted as a result of COVID-19.\" In addition, the occurrence and threat of terrorist attacks may directly or indirectly affect economic conditions, which could adversely affect demand for our products and services. In the event of a major natural or man-made disaster, we could experience loss of life of our employees, destruction of facilities or business interruptions, any of which may materially\nadversely affect our business. If any of our facilities or a significant amount of our rental equipment were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay orders, shipments and revenue recognition and result in expenses to repair or replace the damaged rental equipment and facility not covered by asset, liability, business continuity or other insurance contracts. Also, we could face significant increases in premiums or losses of coverage due to the loss experienced during and associated with these and potential future natural or man-made disasters that may materially adversely affect our business. In addition, attacks or armed conflicts that directly impact one or more of our properties could significantly affect our ability to operate those properties and thereby impair our results of operations.\nIn general, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the global economy and worldwide financial markets. Any such occurrence could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance.\nWe are partly self-insured for a number of different risk categories, such as property, general liability (including product liability), workers' compensation, automobile claims, crime, and cyber liability, with insurance coverage for certain catastrophic risks. The types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements. The occurrence of significant claims, a substantial rise in costs to maintain our insurance, or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to redeploy our units effectively should a significant number of our leased units be returned during a short period of time, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWhile our typical lease terms include contractual provisions requiring customers to retain units on lease for a specified period, our customers generally rent their units for periods longer than the contractual lease terms. As of December 31, 2020, the average lease duration of our lease portfolio was approximately 32 months. If a significant number of leased units are returned in a short period of time, a large supply of units would need to be remarketed. Our failure to effectively remarket a large influx of units returning from leases could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nFailure to close our unit sales transactions as we project could cause our actual revenue or cash flow for a particular fiscal period to differ from expectations.\nSales of new and used modular space and portable storage units to customers represented approximately 6.7% of WillScot Mobile Mini's revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020. Sale transactions are subject to certain factors that are beyond our control, including permit requirements, the timely completion of prerequisite work by others and weather conditions. Accordingly, the actual timing of the completion of these transactions may take longer than we expect. As a result, our actual revenue and cash flow in a particular fiscal period may not consistently correlate to our internal operational plans and budgets. If we are unable to accurately predict the timing of these sales, we may fail to take advantage of business and growth opportunities otherwise available, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial statements and have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud. We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 as amended (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\"). There is no assurance that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not occur or that we will be successful in adequately remediating any such material weaknesses and significant deficiencies. We may in the future discover areas of our internal controls that need improvement. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting and financial processes. Furthermore, as we grow our business, including through acquisition, our internal controls will become more complex, and we will require significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls remain effective. Additionally, the existence of any material weakness or significant deficiency would require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies, and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner. The existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, subject us to investigations from regulatory authorities or cause stockholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could materially and adversely affect us.\nRisks Relating to Our Capital Structure\nGlobal capital and credit market conditions could materially and adversely affect our ability to access the capital and credit markets or the ability of key counterparties to perform their obligations to us.\nAlthough we believe the banks participating in our credit facility have adequate capital and resources, we can provide no assurance that all of those banks will continue to operate as a going concern in the future. If any of the banks in our lending\ngroup were to fail, it is possible that the borrowing capacity under our facility would be reduced. Practical, legal and tax limitations may also limit our ability to access and service the working capital needs of our businesses. In the event that the availability under our credit facility were reduced significantly, we could be required to obtain capital from alternate sources to finance our capital needs. The options for addressing such capital constraints would include, among others, obtaining commitments from the remaining banks in the lending group or from new banks to fund increased amounts under the terms of our credit facility, and seeking to access the public capital markets. In addition, we may delay certain capex to ensure that we maintain appropriate levels of liquidity. If it became necessary to access additional capital, any such alternatives could have terms less favorable than those terms under our credit facility, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, in the future we may need to raise additional funds to, among other things, refinance existing indebtedness, fund existing operations, improve or expand our operations, respond to competitive pressures or make acquisitions. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to achieve our business or strategic objectives or compete effectively. Our ability to pursue certain future opportunities may depend in part on our ongoing access to debt and equity capital markets. We cannot assure you that any such financing will be available on terms satisfactory to us or at all. If we are unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, we may have to curtail our growth by, among other things, curtailing the expansion of our fleet of units or our acquisition strategy. Additionally, future credit market conditions could increase the likelihood that one or more of our lenders may be unable to hone their commitments under our credit facility, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEconomic disruptions affecting key counterparties could also materially adversely affect our business. We monitor the financial strength of our larger customers, derivative counterparties, lenders, vendors, service providers and insurance carriers on a periodic basis using publicly-available information to evaluate our exposure to those who have or who we believe may likely experience significant threats to their ability to adequately perform their obligations to us. The information available will differ from counterparty to counterparty and may be insufficient for us to adequately interpret or evaluate our exposure and/or determine appropriate or timely responses.\nOur leverage may make it difficult for us to service our debt and operate our business.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $2,454.6 million of total indebtedness, excluding deferred financing fees and finance leases, consisting of $1,304.6 million of borrowings under our 2020 ABL Facility, $650.0 million of our 2025 Secured Notes, and $500.0 million of our 2028 Secured Notes. Our leverage could have important consequences, including\n\u2022making it more difficult to satisfy our obligations with respect to our various debt and liabilities;\n\u2022requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt payments, thus reducing the availability of cash flow to fund internal growth through working capital and capex on our existing fleet or a new fleet and for other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or adverse economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt in relation to cash flow and that, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage would prevent us from pursuing;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures; and\n\u2022limiting our ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the future and increasing the costs of such additional financings.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations or to refinance our debt depends on our future operating and financial performance, which will be affected by our ability to successfully implement our business strategy as well as general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before its maturity, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, we may not be able to affect any of these actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of our existing or future debt instruments may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions. If we default on the payments required under the terms of certain of our indebtedness, that indebtedness, together with debt incurred pursuant to other debt agreements or instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, may become payable on demand, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay all of our debts. As a result, our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries will still be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future. Although the credit agreement that governs our credit facility and the indentures that govern our outstanding notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of debt that we could incur in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the credit agreement that governs our credit facility and the indentures do not prevent us from incurring other obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. If we add debt to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 existing debt levels, the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness described above, including our possible inability to service our debt, will increase.\nWe are subject to and may, in the future become subject to, covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility and, if we default under our debt covenants, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations.\nThe credit agreement that governs our credit facility and the indentures that govern our outstanding notes, as well as any instruments that govern any future debt obligations, contain covenants that impose significant restrictions on the way our subsidiaries can operate, including restrictions on the ability to:\n\u2022 incur or guarantee additional debt and issue certain types of stock;\n\u2022 create or incur certain liens;\n\u2022 make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to our equity securities;\n\u2022 prepay or redeem junior debt;\n\u2022 make certain investments or acquisitions, including participating in joint ventures;\n\u2022 engage in certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022 create unrestricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022 create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or advances to, and on\nthe transfer of, assets to the issuer or any restricted subsidiary;\n\u2022 sell assets, consolidate or merge with or into other companies;\n\u2022 sell or transfer all or substantially all our assets or those of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; and\n\u2022 issue or sell share capital of certain subsidiaries.\nAlthough these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications, these covenants could limit our ability to finance future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue acquisitions and other business activities that may be in our interest. Our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. These include prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If any of our subsidiaries default on their obligations under our credit facility or our secured notes, then the relevant lenders or holders could elect to declare the debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, if any, immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that debt. If the debt under our credit facility, the indentures or any other material financing arrangement that we enter into were to be accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay in full such indebtedness.\nThe credit agreement that governs our credit facility also requires our subsidiaries to satisfy specified financial maintenance tests in the event that we do not satisfy certain excess liquidity requirements. Deterioration in our operating results, as well as events beyond our control, including increases in raw materials prices and unfavorable economic conditions, could affect the ability to meet these tests, and we cannot assure that we will meet these tests. If an event of default occurs under our credit facility, the lenders could terminate their commitments and declare all amounts borrowed, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. Borrowings under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions also may be accelerated or become payable on demand. In these circumstances, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness then outstanding.\nThe amount of borrowings permitted at any time under our credit facility is subject to compliance with limits based on a periodic borrowing base valuation of the collateral thereunder. As a result, our access to credit under the credit facility is subject to potential fluctuations depending on the value of the borrowing base of eligible assets as of any measurement date, as well as certain discretionary rights of the agent in respect of the calculation of such borrowing base value. As a result of any change in valuation, the availability under the credit facility may be reduced, or we may be required to make a repayment of the credit facility, which may be significant. The inability to borrow under the credit facility or the use of available cash to repay the credit facility as a result of a valuation change may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial position.\nThe uncertainty regarding the potential phase-out of LIBOR may negatively impact our operating results.\nLIBOR, the interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate on our variable rate debt, including our credit facility and interest rate swaps, is expected to be phased out after 2021, when private-sector banks are no longer required to report the\ninformation used to set the rate. Without this data, LIBOR may no longer be published, or the lack of quality and quantity of data may cause the rate to no longer be representative of the market. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates will become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, although the US Federal Reserve, in connection with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\"ARRC\"), a steering committee comprised of large US financial institutions, is considering replacing US dollar LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"). SOFR is a more generic measure than LIBOR and considers the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by US Treasury securities. Given the inherent differences between LIBOR and SOFR or any other alternative benchmark rate that may be established, there are many uncertainties regarding a transition from LIBOR, including but not limited to the need to amend all contracts with LIBOR as the referenced rate and how this will impact our cost of variable rate debt and derivative financial instruments. We will also need to consider new contracts and if they should reference an alternative benchmark rate or include suggested fallback language, as published by the ARRC. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted and span multiple future periods but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt or derivative financial instruments which may be detrimental to our financial position or operating results.\nOur largest stockholder may have the ability to influence our business and matters requiring approval by our stockholders.\nSapphire Holding, which is controlled by TDR Capital, beneficially owns approximately 26% of the issued and outstanding shares of our Common Stock and warrants giving it the right to buy 2,425,000 additional shares of our Common Stock. Pursuant to a stockholders agreement entered into on July 1, 2020, by and among us and TDR Capital and certain of its affiliates, including Sapphire Holding, TDR Capital has the right to nominate two directors to our Board of Directors, for so long as TDR Capital beneficially owns at least 15% of our Common Stock and one director for so long as TDR Capital beneficially owns at least 5% of our Common Stock. Two directors nominated by Sapphire Holding currently serve on our Board of Directors. Sapphire Holding may have the ability to influence matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors, amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and certain other corporate transactions. Sapphire Holding may have interests that are different from those of other stockholders.\nIn August 2018, Sapphire Holding pledged all of the shares of WillScot\u2019s Class A Common Stock that it owned as security for a margin loan under which Sapphire Holding borrowed $125.0 million (the \"Margin Loan\"). The Margin Loan was scheduled to mature on August 23, 2020. On August 21, 2020, Sapphire Holdings entered into an amended and restated margin loan agreement which, among other things, extends the maturity date of the Margin Loan to August 29, 2022. As of December 31, 2020, 59,725,558 shares of Common Stock are pledged to secure repayment of amounts outstanding under the Margin Loan. An event of default under the Margin Loan could result in the foreclosure on the pledged securities and another stockholder beneficially owning a significant amount of our Common Stock. There can be no assurance that Sapphire Holdings will be able to extend, repay or refinance the loan on terms acceptable to it or at all.\nThe historical market price of WillScot Mobile Mini\u2019s Common Stock has been volatile and the market price of our Common Stock may continue to be volatile and the value of your investment may decline.\nThe historical market price of our Common Stock has been volatile and the market price of our Common Stock may continue to be volatile moving forward. Volatility may cause wide fluctuations in the price of our Common Stock on Nasdaq. The market price of our Common Stock is likely to be affected by:\n\u2022 changes in general conditions in the economy, geopolitical events or the financial markets;\n\u2022 variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022 changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022 our share repurchase or dividend policies;\n\u2022 other developments affecting us, our industry, customers or competitors;\n\u2022 changes in demand for our products or the prices we charge due to changes in economic conditions, competition or other factors;\n\u2022 general economic conditions in the markets where we operate;\n\u2022 the cyclical nature of our customers\u2019 businesses and certain end markets that we service;\n\u2022 rental rate changes in response to competitive factors;\n\u2022 bankruptcy or insolvency of our customers, thereby reducing demand for our used units;\n\u2022 seasonal rental patterns;\n\u2022 acquisitions or divestitures and related costs;\n\u2022 labor shortages, work stoppages or other labor difficulties;\n\u2022 possible unrecorded liabilities of acquired companies;\n\u2022possible write-offs or exceptional charges due to changes in applicable accounting standards, goodwill impairment, or divestiture or impairment of assets;\n\u2022 the operating and stock price performance of companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022 the number of shares available for resale in the public markets under applicable securities laws; and\n\u2022 the composition of our shareholder base.", "PERMNO": 15782, "SIC": 6512, "TIC": "WSC"}
