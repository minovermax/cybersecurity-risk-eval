RISK FACTORS\nThe following risks could affect (and in some cases have affected) the Company's actual results and could cause such results to differ materially from current estimates or expectations:\nIndustry Risks\nChanges in consumer buying habits and preferences for products could have an effect on our sales volumes.\nChanging consumer dietary habits and preferences have impacted sales growth for many of the food and beverage products the Company packages. Preferences are constantly changing based on, among other factors, convenience, cost and health considerations, as well as environmental and social concerns and perceptions. If these trends continue and the Company is unable to adapt to the trends, then the Company\u2019s financial results could be adversely affected.\nThe Company's financial results could be adversely impacted if there are significant increases in prices for raw materials, energy, transportation and other necessary supplies, and the Company is unable to raise prices, or improve productivity to reduce costs.\nLimitations on the availability of, and increases in, the costs of raw materials, including secondary fiber, petroleum-based materials, energy, wood, transportation and other necessary goods and services, could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial results. Because negotiated sales contracts and the market largely determine the pricing for its products, the Company is at times limited in its ability to raise prices and pass through to its customers any inflationary or other cost increases that the Company may incur.\nThe Company uses productivity improvements to reduce costs and offset inflation. These include global continuous improvement initiatives that use statistical process control to help design and manage many types of activities, including production and maintenance. The Company's ability to realize anticipated savings from these improvements is subject to significant operational, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the Company's control. If the Company cannot successfully implement cost savings plans, it may not be able to continue to compete successfully against other manufacturers. In addition, any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect the Company's financial results.\nCompetition and product substitution could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial results.\nThe Company competes with other paperboard manufacturers and carton converters, both domestically and internationally. The Company's products compete with those made from other manufacturers' CUK, as well as SBS and CRB, and other board substrates. Substitute products include plastic, shrink film and corrugated containers. In addition, while the Company has long-term relationships with many of its customers, the underlying contracts may be re-bid or renegotiated from time to time, and the Company may not be successful in renewing such contracts on favorable terms or at all. The Company works to maintain market share through efficiency, product innovations and strategic sourcing to its customers; however, pricing and other competitive pressures may occasionally result in the loss of a customer relationship.\nOperational Risks\nThe Company\u2019s financial results could be adversely impacted by global events outside the Company\u2019s control, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs a result of global events such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, there could be unpredictable disruptions to the Company\u2019s operations that could reduce its future revenues and negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial condition. The COVID-19 pandemic may result in supply chain and transportation disruptions to and from our facilities and affected employees could impact the Company\u2019s ability to operate its facilities and distribute products to its customers in a timely fashion. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets as well as widespread furloughs and layoffs for workers in the broader economy. This volatility and loss of employment may negatively impact consumer buying habits, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company's future growth and financial results could be adversely impacted if the Company is unable to identify strategic acquisitions and to successfully integrate the acquired businesses.\nThe Company has made a significant number of acquisitions in recent years, including the NACP Combination, and expects to make additional strategic acquisitions in the future as part of its overall growth strategy. The Company's ability to continue to make strategic acquisitions from time to time and to integrate the acquired businesses successfully, including obtaining anticipated cost savings or synergies and expected operating results within a reasonable period of time, is an important factor in the Company's future growth. If the Company is unable to properly estimate, account for and realize the expected revenue and cash flow growth and other benefits from its acquisitions, the Company may be required to spend additional time or money on integration efforts that would otherwise have been spent on the development and expansion of its business.\nThe Company\u2019s information technology systems could suffer interruptions, failures or breaches and our business operations could be disrupted, adversely affecting results of operations and the Company\u2019s reputation.\nThe Company\u2019s information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, serve an important role in the operation of the business. These systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, computer viruses or cyber-based attacks. The Company has contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events, however, if they are not effective on a timely basis, business interruptions could occur which may adversely impact results of operations.\nThe Company has been, and likely will continue to be, subject to computer hacking, acts of vandalism or theft, malware, ransomware, computer viruses or other malicious codes, phishing, employee error or malfeasance, catastrophes, unforeseen events or other cyber-attacks. To date, the Company has seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks or events. Any future significant compromise or breach of data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, associate, supplier or Company data, could result in significant costs, interrupted operations, lost sales, fines, lawsuits, and damage to the Company's reputation. However, the ever-evolving threats mean the Company and its third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt their respective systems and processes and overall security environment, as well as those of any companies acquired. There is no guarantee that these measures will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, system compromises or misuses of data. In addition, the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy is becoming increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to the Company's business. Compliance with such requirements could also result in additional costs.\nThe Company could experience material disruptions at our facilities or increases in the cost of insurance.\nAlthough the Company takes appropriate measures to minimize the risk and effect of material disruptions to the business conducted at our facilities, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and fires, as well as other unexpected disruptions such as the unavailability of critical raw materials, power outages and equipment breakdowns or failures can reduce production and increase manufacturing costs. These types of disruptions, whether caused by climate change or other events, could materially adversely affect our earnings, depending upon the duration of the disruption and our ability to shift business to other facilities or find other sources of materials or energy. Any losses due to these events may not be covered by our existing insurance policies and insurance coverage may be subject to certain deductibles. The premiums for insurance coverage have recently increased and may continue to increase, along with the level of deductibles. In addition, the availability of some insurance coverage may decline due to insurance company losses from extensive property damage caused by natural disasters and increased cyber security breaches. In addition, given the Company's integrated supply chain, managing board supply and properly planning for mill outages and downtime must be integrated with the converting plants forecast. Any inability to do so could adversely affect the Company's financial results.\nThe Company may not be able to develop and introduce new products and adequately protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights, which could harm its future success and competitive position.\nThe Company works to increase market share and profitability through product innovation and the introduction of new products. The inability to develop new or better products that satisfy customer and consumer preferences in a timely manner may impact the Company's competitive position.\nThe Company's future success and competitive position also depends, in part, upon its ability to obtain and maintain protection for certain proprietary carton and packaging machine technologies used in its value-added products, particularly those incorporating the Fridge Vendor, IntegraPak, KeelClip, MicroFlex-Q, MicroRite, Quilt Wave, Qwik Crisp, Tite-Pak, and Z-Flute technologies. Failure to protect the Company's existing intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable technologies or may require it to license other companies' intellectual property rights. It is possible that any of the patents owned by the Company may be invalidated, rendered unenforceable, circumvented, challenged or licensed to others or any of its pending or future patent applications may not be issued within the scope of the claims sought by the Company, if at all. Further, others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to the Company's technologies, duplicate its technologies or design around its patents, and steps taken by the Company to protect its technologies may not prevent misappropriation of such technologies.\nThe Company's capital spending may not achieve the desired benefits, which could adversely impact future financial results.\nThe Company invests significant amounts of cash on capital projects each year which have expected returns to the Company. The Company's ability to execute on these projects in order to achieve planned outcomes, including obtaining expected returns and strategic long-term goals within a reasonable period of time, is an important factor in the Company's financial results and commitments to the market. As these investments start up, the Company may experience unanticipated business disruptions and not achieve the desired benefits or timelines. In addition, the Company's acquisitions may require more capital than expected to achieve synergies or expected operating results. Additional spending and unachieved benefits may adversely affect the Company's cash flow and results of operations.\nThe Company may face a shortage of a skilled workforce at its facilities.\nThe Company's ability to maintain or expand its business depends on attracting, training and retaining a skilled workforce. Changing demographics and workforce trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers retire. Failure to attract and retain a skilled workforce may result in operational inefficiencies or require additional capital investments to reduce reliance on labor, which may adversely impact the Company's results.\nThe Company is subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries.\nThe Company has converting plants and one paper mill in 11 countries outside of the U.S. and sells its products worldwide. For 2020, before intercompany eliminations, net sales from operations outside of the U.S. represented approximately 21% of the Company\u2019s net sales. The Company\u2019s revenues from foreign sales fluctuate with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company pursues a currency hedging program in order to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on financial results. In addition, at December 31, 2020, approximately 16% of the Company's total assets were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\nThe Company is also subject to the following significant risks associated with operating in foreign countries:\n\u2022Compliance with and enforcement of environmental, health and safety and labor laws and other regulations of the foreign countries in which the Company operates;\n\u2022Export compliance;\n\u2022Imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries; and\n\u2022Imposition of new or increases in capital investment requirements and other financing requirements by foreign governments.\nIn addition to these general risks, uncertainties surrounding the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d) could adversely affect our U.K. business, including potentially the Company's relationships with customers, suppliers and employees.\nFinancial Risks\nThe Company's indebtedness may adversely affect its financial condition and its ability to react to changes in its business.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had an aggregate principal amount of $3,666.6 million of outstanding debt.\nBecause of the Company's debt level, a portion of its cash flows from operations is dedicated to payments on indebtedness and the Company's ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be restricted in the future.\nAdditionally, the Company\u2019s Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended by the Incremental Facility Amendment) and the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (collectively, the \u201cCurrent Credit Agreement\u201d) and the indentures governing the 4.75% Senior Notes due 2021 (redeemed January 2021), 4.875% Senior Notes due 2022, 4.125% Senior Notes due 2024, 4.75% Senior Notes due 2027, 3.50% Senior Notes due 2028 and 3.50% Senior Notes due 2029 (the \u201cIndentures\u201d) may prohibit or restrict, among other things, the disposal of assets, the incurrence of additional indebtedness (including guarantees), the incurrence of liens, payment of dividends, share repurchases, the making of acquisitions and other investments and certain other types of transactions. These restrictions could limit the Company\u2019s flexibility to respond to changing market conditions and competitive pressures. The debt obligations and restrictions may also leave the Company more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions or its business, or unable to carry out capital expenditures that are necessary or important to its growth strategy and productivity improvement programs.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 35% of the Company\u2019s debt is subject to variable rates of interest and exposes the Company to increased debt service obligations in the event of increased market interest rates.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nThe Company is subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and costs to comply with such laws and regulations, or any liability or obligation imposed under new laws or regulations, could negatively impact its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to a broad range of foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing discharges to air, soil and water, the management, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, the investigation and remediation of contamination resulting from releases of hazardous substances, recycling of packaging, and the health and safety of employees. The Company cannot currently assess the impact that future emission standards, climate control initiatives, regulation changes and enforcement practices will have on the Company's operations and capital expenditure requirements. Environmental liabilities and obligations may result in significant costs, which could negatively impact the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
