{"cik": "1548187", "company": "Soliton, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully all of the material risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Form 10-K. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nRISK FACTORS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE\nWe will require substantial additional funding, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, and, if not so available, may require us to delay, limit, reduce or cease our operations.\nWe have used the proceeds from our IPO and recent financings to advance our initially approved RAP device through the FDA clearance process and commercial development in preparation for commercial launch with a Generation 2 device. The Generation 2 device that we intend to offer in our initial commercial launch, will have significant changes from the Generation 1 device we have submitted for FDA review and clearance. The changes made to our device from Generation 1 to Generation 2 necessitated the filing of an additional 510(k) before being launched. We cannot be certain that the changes we deem appropriate to make to future RAP devices prior to the launch of any of these device will not require another 510(k) filing. Commercializing and launching medical device products can be expensive. Our current available cash is not sufficient to complete the commercialization and launch of our product. We will require substantial additional future capital in order to complete commercialization, launch and market the device nationwide, build out a sales force and manufacture the device. We will continue to require substantial additional capital to continue commercialization activities.\nWe have determined there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern; as a result, we could have difficulty finding additional financing.\nOur financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. We have not generated any revenue from our main operations since inception and have accumulated losses. Our ability to continue our operations depends on our ability to complete equity or debt financings or generate profitable operations. Such financings may not be available or may not be available on reasonable terms. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that could result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital when needed, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected, and we will need to significantly modify our operational plans to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we might have to liquidate our assets and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements. The inclusion of a going concern explanatory paragraph by our auditors, our lack of cash resources and our potential inability to continue as a going concern may materially adversely affect our share price and our ability to raise new capital or to enter into critical contractual relations with third parties.\nWe anticipate needing additional financing over the longer term to execute our business plan and fund operations, which additional financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had total assets of $13,140,973, including cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $12,076,425. We have an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2019, of $56,043,371. Our cash on hand of $10,081,593 at February 11, 2020 is expected to fund our operations into the third quarter of 2020, but not beyond. We believe that we will require additional capital to mount a major sales and marketing effort and execute our business plan. We cannot give any assurance that we will be able to obtain all the necessary funding that we may need. We may pursue additional funding through various financing sources, including additional public offerings, the issuance of debt securities, fees associated with licensing some or all of our technology, joint ventures with capital partners and project type financing. There can be no assurance that funds will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to further pursue our business plan and we may be unable to continue operations, in which case you may lose some or all of your investment. Alternatively, we may consider changes in our business plan that might enable us to achieve aspects of our business objectives and lead to some commercial success with a smaller amount of capital, but we cannot assure that changes in our business plan will result in revenues or maintain any value in your investment.\nWe have a limited operating history and we expect a number of factors to cause our operating results to fluctuate on an annual basis, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nWe formed our corporation in 2012 without a working RAP prototype. During the first 5 years of operations, we focused on research and development of a fully-integrated working prototype of the RAP device to remove tattoos. During the past 2 years, we have focused our efforts on developing a commercial device that would receive FDA clearance to sell. We applied for FDA clearance in March 2019; after such application our efforts will be focused on refining our commercial device to improve ease of use features necessary for adoption in dermatological settings. Developing this commercial device for our market launch is anticipated to cost at least $2.6 million and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2020. Further refinement to the device to develop the GEN 3.0 device is anticipated to cost at least an additional $2.5 million and take another year of additional work. Additionally, a high percentage of our expenses will be associated with pre-launch marketing activities as well as fixed costs. We have not yet sold any products, and we may never achieve commercial success with RAP technology. We have limited historical financial data upon which we may base our projected revenue and operating expenses. Our limited operating history makes it difficult for potential investors to evaluate our technology or prospective operations and business prospects. As a pre-commercialization stage company, we are subject to all the risks inherent in business development, financing, unexpected expenditures, and complications and delays that often occur in a new business. Investors should evaluate an investment in us in light of the uncertainties encountered by developing companies in a competitive environment. There can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that we will ultimately be able to attain profitability.\nRAP utilizes potentially dangerous energy levels and we could face liability for claims related to the RAP device that would be costly and would damage our reputation.\nThe acoustic shockwaves generated by our RAP device are the result of producing and directing electrical energy within the device's hand piece approaching 3,000 volts at 3,000 amps of current. Although the RAP device has been designed in accordance, and has been independently tested and found to comply, with the electrical and other safety requirements for comparable medical devices, we cannot be certain that such design and testing measures have identified every possible mode of failure. An unanticipated failure mode or misuse of the RAP device could potentially expose the operator or patient to hazardous and potentially lethal electrical shock and we could face liability for claims of injury or death and our ability to commercialize the RAP device could be materially harmed. In addition, such claims would damage our reputation and hinder our ability to commercialize the RAP device.\nWe cannot assure you that we will generate revenue or become profitable in the future.\nOur products may never be cleared by the FDA or become commercially viable or accepted for use. We have incurred significant losses since our inception and expect to experience operating losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future. We expect to expend significant resources on hiring of personnel, continued scientific and product research and development, product testing and preclinical and clinical investigation, intellectual property development and prosecution, marketing and promotion, capital expenditures, working capital, general and administrative expenses, and fees and expenses associated with our capital raising efforts. We expect to incur costs and expenses related to consulting costs, hiring of scientists, engineers, science and other operational personnel, and the continued development of relationships with strategic partners.\nThe use of lasers to remove tattoos has inherent dangers and our device will be used in conjunction with lasers for tattoo removal.\nOur RAP device uses rapid pulses of designed acoustic shockwaves to dramatically accelerate the removal of tattoos when used in conjunction with existing lasers. Specifically, our technology allows a doctor to treat a patient multiple times in a single office visit and significantly reduce the overall time it takes to remove a tattoo. Recognized and published (see \"Complications of Tattoos and Tattoo Removal: Stop and Think Before you ink;\" Khunger, Molpariya, & Khunger, 2015) adverse events of Q-switched laser tattoo removal include: pain; blistering; crusting; pinpoint hemorrhage; urticarial reaction; hypopigmentation; hyperpigmentation; leukotrichia; local-papule; plaques; darkening of tattoos; photoallergic reactions; systemic reactions; residual pigmentation; ghost images; scarring; and textural changes. These adverse events may be increased when multiple laser passes are used to remove a tattoo in a single session.\nBecause we have not yet launched the RAP device, we have been using our available capital resources for development of the commercial units and have not yet generated any revenues; therefore, we may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nWe are a pre-revenue stage medical device company, and do not expect to generate any revenues until our commercial RAP device, cleared by the FDA, has been updated for use in the field, had those updates cleared by the FDA, and are sold. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our generating cash flow from sales that are sufficient to fund operations or finding adequate financing to support our operations. To date, we have had no revenues and have relied on equity-based financing from the sale of securities in private placements, the issuance of convertible and non-convertible notes, and proceeds from our IPO and private placements. Our sales plan may not be successful in achieving a sustainable business and revenues. We have no arrangements in place for all the anticipated required financing to be able to fully implement our business plan. If we are unable to continue as planned currently, we may have to curtail some or all of our business plan and operations. In such case, investors may lose some or all of their investment.\nOur clinical experience with the RAP device is limited to black tattoos with one type of laser, and future trials may not result in similar results.\nTo date, our clinical trial data is limited to the use of the RAP device in conjunction with Q-Switched lasers treating primarily black tattoos. We do not have clinical data indicating the efficacy of the RAP device in conjunction with shorter pulse \u201cPico-Switched\u201d lasers or in treating tattoo ink colors other than black. Although, based on animal and theoretical models, we believe RAP has the potential to be similarly effective in such instances, we cannot be certain. If it is not as effective in such instances, our ability to successfully commercialize the RAP device could be materially harmed.\nClinical trials may be necessary to support future product submissions to FDA. These clinical trials will be expensive and will require the enrollment of large numbers of patients, and suitable patients may be difficult to identify and recruit. Delays or failures in our clinical trials will prevent us from commercializing any modified or new products and will adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nInitiating and completing clinical trials necessary to support any future PMA applications, and additional safety and efficacy data beyond that typically required for a 510(k) clearance, for our possible future product candidates, will be time consuming and expensive and the outcome uncertain. Moreover, the results of early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, and any product we advance into clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials.\nConducting successful clinical studies will require the enrollment of large numbers of patients, and suitable patients may be difficult to identify and recruit. Patient enrollment in clinical trials and completion of patient participation and follow-up depends on many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the attractiveness of, or the discomforts and risks associated with, the treatments received by enrolled subjects, the availability of appropriate clinical trial investigators, support staff, and proximity of patients to clinical sites and able to comply with the eligibility and exclusion criteria for participation in the clinical trial and patient compliance. For example, patients may be discouraged from enrolling in our clinical trials if the trial protocol requires them to undergo extensive post-treatment procedures or follow-up to assess the safety and effectiveness of our products or if they determine that the treatments received under the trial protocols are not attractive or involve unacceptable risks or discomforts.\nDevelopment of sufficient and appropriate clinical protocols to demonstrate safety and efficacy are required and we may not adequately develop such protocols to support clearance and approval. Further, the FDA may require us to submit data on a greater number of patients than we originally anticipated and/or for a longer follow-up period or change the data collection requirements or data analysis applicable to our clinical trials. Delays in patient enrollment or failure of patients to continue to participate in a clinical trial may cause an increase in costs and delays in the approval and attempted commercialization of our products or result in the failure of the clinical trial. In addition, despite considerable time and expense invested in our clinical trials, FDA may not consider our data adequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Such increased costs and delays or failures could adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nIf the third parties on which we rely to conduct our clinical trials and to assist us with pre-clinical development do not perform as contractually required or expected, we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for or commercialize our products.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct our pre-clinical and clinical trials for our product candidates and future products and we must rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct such trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if these third parties need to be replaced, or if the quality or\naccuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our pre-clinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, our products on a timely basis, if at all, and our business, operating results and prospects may be adversely affected. Furthermore, our third-party clinical trial investigators may be delayed in conducting our clinical trials for reasons outside of their control.\nThe results of our clinical trials may not support our product candidate claims or may result in the discovery of adverse side effects.\nEven though our first clinical trials are completed, we cannot be certain that their results will support our product candidate claims or that the FDA will agree with our conclusions regarding them. Success in pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the later trials will replicate the results of prior trials and pre-clinical studies. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for the proposed indicated uses, which could cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of others. Any delay or termination of our clinical trials will delay the filing of our product submissions and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenues. It is also possible that patients enrolled in clinical trials will experience adverse side effects that are not currently part of the product candidate\u2019s profile.\nWe may be required to suspend or discontinue clinical trials due to side effects or other safety risks that could preclude approval of our products.\nOur clinical trials may be suspended at any time for a number of reasons. We may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that they present an unacceptable risk to participants. In addition, regulatory agencies may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials at any time if they believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or that they present an unacceptable safety risk to participants.\nWe utilize a single manufacturer, Sanmina Corporation, for the manufacture of the RAP device and expect to continue to do so for commercial devices. Risks associated with the manufacturing of our products could reduce our gross margins and negatively affect our operating results.\nWe do not have any manufacturing facilities or direct manufacturing personnel. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on Sanmina Corporation for the manufacture of the RAP device for commercial manufacture. Although Sanmina is a large contract manufacturer of medical devices, we are subject to numerous risks relating to our reliance on their manufacturing capabilities. If they encounter problems in manufacturing the RAP device then our business could be significantly impacted. These problems include:\n\u2022inability to secure product components in a timely manner, in sufficient quantities or on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022failure to increase production of the RAP device to meet demand;\n\u2022inability to modify production lines to enable us to efficiently produce future products or implement changes in current products in response to regulatory requirements;\n\u2022difficulty identifying and qualifying alternative manufacturers in a timely manner;\n\u2022inability to establish agreements with future third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms; or\n\u2022potential damage to or destruction of our manufacturers' equipment or facilities.\nAs demand for our products increases, our manufacturer will need to invest additional resources to purchase components, hire and train employees, and enhance their manufacturing processes. If they fail to increase production capacity efficiently, our sales may not increase in line with our expectations and our operating margins could fluctuate or decline. The RAP device has many parts that are specialized high-voltage components and many of these components are only produced by one supplier and the loss of any of these suppliers, or their inability to provide Sanmina with an adequate supply of materials, could harm our business. For our business strategy to be successful, Sanmina must be able to provide us with components in sufficient quantities, in compliance with regulatory requirements and quality control standards, in accordance with agreed upon specifications, at acceptable costs and on a timely basis. Future increases in sales of the RAP device could strain the ability of Sanmina to deliver an increasingly large supply of components and RAP systems in a manner that meets these various requirements. We do not have a long-term agreement with Sanmina and contract with Sanmina on a project-to-project basis\nutilizing a separate purchase order for each project. As such, there is no assurance that Sanmina will continue to provide us with manufacturing services in the future.\nWe have limited experience in assembling and testing our products and may encounter problems or delays in the assembly of our products or fail to meet certain regulatory requirements which could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe have limited experience in assembling and testing our RAP device, and no experience in doing so on a commercial scale. To become profitable, we must assemble and test the RAP device in commercial quantities in compliance with regulatory requirements and at an acceptable cost. Increasing our capacity to assemble and test our products on a commercial scale will require us to improve internal efficiencies. We may encounter a number of difficulties in increasing our assembly and testing capacity, including:\n\u2022managing production yields;\n\u2022maintaining quality control and assurance;\n\u2022providing component and service availability;\n\u2022maintaining adequate control policies and procedures;\n\u2022hiring and retaining qualified personnel; and\n\u2022complying with state, federal and foreign regulations.\nIf we are unable to satisfy commercial demand for our RAP device due to our inability to assemble and test our RAP device, our ability to generate revenue would be impaired, market acceptance of our products could be adversely affected and customers may instead purchase or use, our competitors\u2019 products.\nCertain parts used in the manufacturing of our equipment may experience shortages in global supply which could impact our ability to manufacture our device for customers or maintain research and development timelines.\nThere are a number of component parts used in the manufacture of our device that are used by many manufacturers in a variety of products. We will compete with other manufacturers for the supply of these components. Additionally, certain parts that are currently in our design may be discontinued by our supplier requiring us to find alternative parts. This issue may require us to change the design of our device or purchase significant inventories of these parts in order to protect against manufacturing delays. We may not be able to procure alternative components or adequate raw material inventories which would result in an inability to produce our device.\nWe have limited sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities or arrangements, and will need to substantially build out these capabilities as we move towards commercialization of our products.\nWe do not yet have sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities or arrangements. To be able to commercialize our potential products, we will need to develop all of the foregoing. We have limited experience in establishing these capabilities, and therefore, we may be unsuccessful in achieving commercialization and earning revenues. We believe that setting up the commercialization parts of the Company will take substantial capital and commitment of time and effort. We may seek development and marketing partners for RAP technology and license technology that is complementary, but not directly associated with RAP technology to others in order to avoid our having to provide the marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities within our organization. There can be no assurance that we will find any development and marketing partners or companies that are interested in licensing our technology. If we are unable to establish and maintain adequate sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, independently or with others, we will not be able to generate product revenue, and may not become profitable.\nAchieving and maintaining market acceptance of the RAP device for tattoo removal could be negatively impacted by many factors, which may prevent us from successfully commercializing the RAP device.\nEven though the RAP device is cleared by the FDA, we may not be successful achieving market acceptance of the RAP device for tattoo removal. Many factors could negatively impact our ability to achieve or maintain market acceptance, including:\n\u2022the failure of the RAP device to achieve wide acceptance among people who regret having one or more tattoos or have a tattoo they would like to modify (prospective clients), dermatologists, and key opinion leaders in the tattoo removal community;\n\u2022possible reluctance by dermatologists to change their current practices because of perceived liability risks arising from the use of new products;\n\u2022perceived risks associated with the use of the RAP device or similar products or technologies generally;\n\u2022the introduction of competitive products and the rate of acceptance of those products as compared to the RAP device;\n\u2022adverse results of future clinical trials relating to the RAP device or similar competitive products; and\n\u2022adverse publicity or other adverse events including any product liability lawsuits.\nIf we are not successful in convincing prospective clients and dermatologists of the benefits of the RAP device then our sales potential, strategic objectives and profitability could be negatively impacted, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf important assumptions we have made about what prospective clients want and are willing to purchase are inaccurate, our business and operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur business strategy was developed based on a number of important assumptions about prospective clients, including their desire to have one or more tattoos removed, their reasons for not taking action to remove those tattoos to date and their willingness to pay for an improved method of removing their tattoos. These assumptions were based on published secondary research, as well as primary research commissioned by us. This research may be flawed and/or any of the resulting assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. If so, our efforts to commercialize the RAP device, even though cleared by the FDA, may fall short of expectations and you could lose some or all of your investment.\nThe sizes of the markets for our RAP device have not been established with precision, and may be smaller than we estimate.\nOur estimates of the annual total addressable markets for our products, including those under development, are based on a number of internal and third-party estimates. While we believe our assumptions and the data underlying our estimates are reasonable, these assumptions and estimates may not be correct and the conditions supporting our assumptions or estimates may change at any time, thereby reducing the predictive accuracy of these underlying factors. If the actual number of people who would benefit from our products, the price at which we can sell our products, or the annual total addressable market for our products is smaller than we have estimated, it may impair our sales growth and have an adverse impact on our business.\nAll of our near-term indications are elective procedures that will be not be reimbursable and to the extent there is a general reduction in discretionary spending that could result in a reduction in the demand for these services.\nThe decision to undergo a procedure from our systems will be driven by consumer demand. Procedures performed using our systems will be elective procedures, the cost of which must be borne by the patient and are not reimbursable through government or private health insurance. In times of economic uncertainty or recession, individuals often reduce the amount of money that they spend on discretionary items, including aesthetic procedures. The general economic difficulties being experienced and the lack of availability of consumer credit for some of our customers' patients could adversely affect the markets in which we will operate.\nWe expect to operate in a highly competitive market, we may face competition from large, well-established medical device and product manufacturers with significant resources, and we may not be able to compete effectively.\nA method for facilitating multiple laser passes in a single office visit by applying a chemically infused patch (PFD Patch) to the skin was introduced to the market within the last several years. Although we believe, based on currently available published clinical data for the PFD Patch, that the Soliton method is more effective than the PFD Patch, the company that owns the PFD Patch, Merz Pharma, has substantially more resources than Soliton. Furthermore, we have made this assessment based on separate clinical trials with differing protocols, not on a direct head-to-head comparison between the PFD Patch and the Soliton method, so we cannot be certain that the Soliton method is more effective. Also, there are currently a number of laser companies such as Lumenis, Cynosure (Hologic) and Cutera that market their lasers for tattoo removal and all of these companies have substantially more resources than Soliton. Furthermore, our clinical trials have demonstrated clinically significant improvement in tattoo fading over laser alone. Since we are pursuing FDA clearance for the RAP device to treat tattoos in conjunction with lasers, some of these companies may view our product as a competitive threat.\nAlso, there may be numerous companies of which we are not aware that may be working on separate technology for tattoo fading or removal. As well, the broader market for energy-based devices in the aesthetic market is becoming more competitive. Over time, we believe this field will become subject to more rapid change and new devices and products will emerge. We may find ourselves in competition with companies that have competitive advantages over us, such as:\n\u2022greater name recognition;\n\u2022established relations with dermatologists;\n\u2022established distribution networks;\n\u2022additional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates, higher discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage; and\n\u2022greater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing, and patent litigation.\nAs a result, we may not be able to compete effectively against these companies or their devices and products.\nRapidly changing technology in life sciences could make the products we are developing obsolete.\nThe medical device and life-science industry in general is characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards. Our future success will depend on our ability to continually develop and then improve the products that we design and to develop and introduce new products that address the evolving needs of our customers on a timely and cost-effective basis.\nIf we do not enhance our product offerings through our research and development efforts on a timely basis, we may fail to effectively compete or become profitable.\nIn order to capture and grow market share in the tattoo removal market, we will need to enhance and broaden our product offerings to meet the evolving demands of patients and dermatologists, as well as compete against new technologies. The success of the RAP device or future versions of the RAP device will depend on numerous factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022identify product enhancements that improve performance of tattoo removal and clinicians\u2019 ability to use the device and successfully incorporate those features into our products;\n\u2022develop and introduce future generations of the RAP device in a timely manner;\n\u2022offer products at a price that is competitive with other products then available; and\n\u2022adequately protect our intellectual property and avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third-parties.\nWe have in the past experienced, and we may in the future experience, delays in various phases of product development and commercial launch, including engineering, manufacturing, and marketing. Any delays in our anticipated product launches may significantly impede our ability to successfully compete in our markets. In particular, such delays could cause customers to delay or forego purchases of our products. Even if we are able to successfully develop the RAP device or future versions of the RAP device when anticipated, these products may not produce sales in excess of the costs of development, and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by the changing preferences of dermatologists and patients, or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features.\nPotential complications from the RAP device or future versions of the RAP device may not be revealed by our clinical experience or other testing. Undetected errors or defects in the RAP device or future versions of the RAP device could harm our reputation, decrease the market acceptance of the RAP device or expose us to product liability claims.\nOur RAP device is a highly complex device with many potential areas for undetected errors, defects or other complications. We cannot be certain that our clinical and other safety and efficacy testing has revealed all such complications. If such complications emerge in the future, we may not have sufficient resources to address them and our commercialization plans could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we lose key management personnel, or if we fail to recruit additional highly skilled personnel, our ability to expand our operations and increase the size of our company will be impaired, and we may experience loss of markets or market share and we may become less competitive.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had ten employees, including nine full-time employees and one part-time employee. Because of our small size, growth in accordance with our business plan will place a significant strain on our financial, technical, operational and management resources. As we advance our product candidates through commercial development, launch and post-launch activities, we will need to increase our product development, scientific and administrative headcount to manage these programs.\nWe are highly dependent upon the principal members of our management team, scientific advisory board and consultants. These persons have significant experience not only in development, regulatory, commercialization and business development activities, but also with the RAP system, acoustic energy and the biology of tattoos. If we lose one or more of our executive officers or key employees or consultants, our ability to implement our business strategy successfully could be seriously harmed. Any of our executive officers or key employees or consultants may terminate their employment at any time. Replacing executive officers, key employees and consultants may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products successfully. Competition to hire and retain employees and consultants from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these additional key personnel and consultants. Our failure to retain key personnel or consultants could materially harm our business.\nIn addition, we have scientific and clinical advisors and consultants who assist us in formulating our regulatory and clinical strategies. These advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us and typically they will not enter into non-compete agreements with us. If a conflict of interest arises between their work for us and their work for another entity, we may lose their services. In addition, our advisors may have arrangements with other companies to assist those companies in developing products or technologies that may compete with ours.\nIn addition, to meet our obligations as a public company, we may need to increase our general and administrative capabilities. Our management, personnel and systems currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth. If we are unable to successfully manage this growth and increased complexity of operations, our business may be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to establish good relationships with physicians, our business could be negatively affected.\nOur business model will depend on the distribution of our RAP device into the offices of practicing dermatologists and other physicians. This will require us to build and maintain good relationships with physicians who will have a significant source of patients that will generate treatment revenues for both the physician and the Company. If we are unable to establish good relationships with physicians and maintain them, it will jeopardize both device and replaceable component revenues.\nWe may become subject to legal proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time and in the ordinary course of our business, we may become involved in various legal proceedings. All such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and, regardless of the merits of the claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and distracting to management. If resolved against us, such legal proceedings could result in excessive verdicts, injunctive relief or other equitable relief that may affect how we operate our business. Similarly, if we settle such legal proceedings, it may affect how we operate our business. Future court decisions, alternative dispute resolution awards, business expansion or legislative activity may increase our exposure to litigation and regulatory investigations. In some cases, substantial non-economic remedies or punitive damages may be sought. Although we maintain liability insurance coverage, there can be no assurance that such coverage will cover any particular verdict, judgment or settlement that may be entered against us, that such coverage will prove to be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. If we incur liability that exceeds our insurance coverage or that is not within the scope of the coverage in legal proceedings brought against us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nEconomic uncertainty or economic deterioration could adversely affect us.\nWhile the global economy is improving, there are still uncertainties surrounding the strength and duration of the recovery that may continue to drive stock market and interest rate volatility and adversely impact consumer confidence, product demand, and our ability to refinance our debt. Economic conditions, along with our operating performance, may also materially and adversely impact our ability to access the financial markets. Accordingly, our future business and financial results are subject to uncertainty. If economic conditions deteriorate in the future, our future revenues and financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have limited brand awareness and there is no assurance that we will be able to achieve brand awareness.\nWe have achieved limited brand awareness with respect to our RAP technology. There is no assurance that we will be able to achieve brand awareness. In addition, we must develop a successful market for our products in order to complete sales. If we are not able to develop successful markets for our products, then such failure will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product or indication and fail to capitalize on products or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on specific products, indications and discovery programs. As a result, we may forgo or delay pursuit of other opportunities with others that could have had greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular potential product, we may relinquish valuable rights to that potential product through future collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such potential product.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or man-made disasters or business interruptions, for which we are predominantly self-insured. We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce our products. Our ability to obtain clinical supplies of our products could be disrupted if the operations of these suppliers were affected by a man-made or natural disaster or other business interruption. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nRISK RELATED TO REGULATORY ISSUES\nThere is no guarantee that the FDA will grant 510(k) or de novo clearance or PMA approval of our future products and failure to obtain necessary clearances or approvals for our future products would adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nOur lead product candidate, as well as some of our future products, will require FDA clearance of a 510(k) or de novo application or may require FDA approval of a PMA. The FDA may not approve or clear these products for the indications that are necessary or desirable for successful commercialization. Indeed, the FDA may refuse our requests for premarket clearance or premarket approval of new products, new intended uses or modifications to existing products. Failure to receive clearance or approval for our products would have an adverse effect on our ability to continue or expand our business.\nIf we fail to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals and clearances, or are unable to obtain, or experience significant delays in obtaining, FDA clearances or approvals for our RAP device, our future products or product enhancements, our ability to commercially distribute and market these products could suffer.\nOur products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes on the basis of the intended use of the device, the risk associated with the use of the device for that indication, as determined by the FDA, and on the controls deemed by the FDA to be necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class I devices, which have the lowest level of risk associated with them, are subject to general controls. Class II devices are subject to general controls and special controls, including performance standards. Class III devices, which have the highest level of risk associated with them, are subject to general controls and premarket approval. Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempt from a requirement that\nthe manufacturer submit a premarket notification, or 510(k), and receive clearance from the FDA which is otherwise a premarketing requirement for a Class II device. Class III devices may not be commercialized until a premarket approval application, (\" PMA\"), is submitted to and approved by the FDA.\nThe process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming, and we may not be able to obtain these clearances or approvals on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA will clear marketing of a lower risk medical device through the 510(k) process if the manufacturer demonstrates that the new product is substantially equivalent to other 510(k)-cleared products or through a de novo process if substantial equivalence is not available. High risk devices deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices, or devices not deemed substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device, require the approval of a PMA. The PMA process is more costly, lengthy and uncertain than the 510(k) or de-novo clearance processes. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data, to demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device for its intended use. FDA also allows the submission of a direct de-novo petition. This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Prior to the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 (\u201cFDASIA\u201d), a medical device could only be eligible for de-novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) premarket notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent. FDASIA streamlined the de-novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de-novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. We believe our Generation 2 device will require clearance through the 510(k) or de-novo process, If the FDA determines that the Generation 2 of the RAP device should be considered a Class III device for treatment of future indications more medical in nature, we may be required to pursue a PMA, which could consume several years of additional approval time and considerable unanticipated expense.\nU.S. legislative or FDA regulatory reforms or changes in internal FDA policies and procedures may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates and to manufacture, market and distribute our products after approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory approval, manufacture and marketing of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of future products. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. Any change in the laws or regulations that govern the clearance and approval processes relating to our current and future products could make it more difficult and costly to obtain clearance or approval for new products, or to produce, market and distribute existing products. Significant delays in receiving clearance or approval, or the failure to receive clearance or approval for our new products would have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business.\nOur financial performance may be adversely affected by medical device tax provisions in the healthcare reform legislation.\nThe imposition of the 2.3% medical device excise tax enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act could adversely affect our financial results. Although the suspension of the excise tax was extended to the end of 2019, we do not know whether the suspension will continue beyond 2019. We may not be able to pass along the cost of the tax to our customers or offset the cost of the tax through higher sales volumes resulting from the expansion of health insurance coverage. Ongoing implementation of this legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nModifications to our products may require new regulatory clearances or approvals or may require us to recall or cease marketing our products until clearances or approvals are obtained.\nModifications to our products may require new regulatory approvals or clearances, including 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals, or require us to recall or cease marketing the modified devices until these clearances or approvals are obtained. The FDA requires device manufacturers to initially make and document a determination of whether or not a modification requires a new approval, supplement or clearance. A manufacturer may determine that a modification could not significantly affect safety or efficacy and does not represent a major change in its intended use, so that no new 510(k) clearance is necessary. However, the FDA can review a manufacturer's decision and may disagree. The FDA may also, on its own initiative, determine that a new 510(k) clearance, de-novo submission or PMA approval is required. Once we have a\ncommercialized product, we may make modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require additional clearances or approvals. If the FDA disagrees and requires new clearances or approvals for these modifications, we may be required to recall and to stop marketing our products as modified, which could require us to redesign our products and harm our operating results. In these circumstances, we may be subject to significant enforcement actions.\nWhere we determine that modifications to our products require a new 510(k) or de-novo clearance or PMA application, we may not be able to obtain those additional clearances or approvals for the modifications or additional indications in a timely manner, or at all. Obtaining clearances and approvals can be a time-consuming process, and delays in obtaining required future clearances or approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our future growth.\nThe Generation 1 device, which has been cleared by the FDA for tattoo removal, is not ready for commercial launch and we will need to modify this device prior to commercial launch, which modifications may be unsuccessful or costly.\nWe conducted our clinical trials for the acceleration of tattoo removal with and have applied for premarket clearance based on a device that is not optimized for commercial launch. We have made certain modifications and we expect to make additional modifications to this Generation 1 device that include improvements in user interface, improvements to extend the life and ease of replacement of the consumable treatment head cartridges and general aesthetics, which will be made via a next genration devices intended for commercial market launch, respectively. The changes made to our device from Generation 1 to Generation 2 will necessitate the filing of an additional 510(k) before being launched. We cannot be certain that the changes we deem appropriate to make to the future RAP device prior to that product's launch will not require another 510(k) filing. While we believe these changes will not affect the therapy delivered by our RAP device, we may be unsuccessful or experience delays in making these changes and/or the FDA may require additional 510(k) submissions to properly document these changes.\nEven if our products are cleared or approved by the FDA, if we or our suppliers fail to comply with ongoing FDA requirements, or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, these products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market.\nAny product for which we obtain clearance or approval, and the manufacturing processes, reporting requirements, post-approval clinical data and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continued regulatory review, oversight and periodic inspections by the FDA and other domestic and foreign regulatory bodies. In particular, we and our suppliers are required to comply with FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulations, (\"QSR\"), which covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of any product for which we obtain clearance or approval. FDA enforces the QSR and other regulations through periodic inspections. The failure by us or one of our suppliers to comply with applicable statutes and regulations administered by the FDA, or the failure to timely and adequately respond to any adverse inspection observations or product safety issues, could result in, among other things, any of the following enforcement actions:\n\u2022untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u2022unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions;\n\u2022customer notifications for repair, replacement, refunds;\n\u2022recall, detention or seizure of our products;\n\u2022operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022refusing or delaying our requests for premarket clearance or premarket approval of new products or modified products;\n\u2022operating restrictions;\n\u2022withdrawing premarket clearances on PMA approvals that have already been granted;\n\u2022refusal to grant export approval for our products; or\n\u2022criminal prosecution.\nIf any of these actions were to occur, it would harm our reputation and cause our product sales and profitability to suffer and may prevent us from generating revenue. Furthermore, our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements which could result in our failure to produce our products on a timely basis and in the required quantities, if at all.\nEven if regulatory clearance or approval of a product is granted, such clearance or approval may be subject to limitations on the intended uses for which the product may be marketed and reduce our potential to successfully commercialize the product and generate revenue from the product. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials, labeling, training or other marketing or educational activities constitute promotion of an unapproved use, it could request that we cease or modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our training or other promotional materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement.\nIn addition, we may be required to conduct costly post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or effectiveness of our products, and we must comply with medical device reporting requirements, including the reporting of adverse events and malfunctions related to our products. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, manufacturing problems, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements such as QSR, may result in changes to labeling, restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of the products from the market, voluntary or mandatory recalls, a requirement to repair, replace or refund the cost of any medical device we manufacture or distribute, fines, suspension of regulatory approvals, product seizures, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties which would adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nOur products may in the future be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation, business and financial results.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. In the case of the FDA, the authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious injury or death. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The FDA requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to FDA within 10 working days after the recall is initiated. Companies are required to maintain certain records of recalls, even if they are not reportable to the FDA. We may initiate voluntary recalls involving our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, they could require us to report those actions as recalls. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales. In addition, the FDA could take enforcement action for failing to report the recalls when they were conducted.\nIf our products cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury, or malfunction in certain ways, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions.\nUnder the FDA medical device reporting regulations, medical device manufacturers are required to report to the FDA information that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or one of our similar devices were to recur. If we fail to report these events to the FDA within the required time frames, or at all, FDA could take enforcement action against us. Any such adverse event involving our products also could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR LICENSE AGREEMENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe have licensed certain intellectual property rights for our technology from MD Anderson, and if our license agreement with MD Anderson is terminated, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe are a party to a royalty-bearing, worldwide, exclusive license agreement for certain intellectual property rights, including patent rights related to RAP technology, with MD Anderson. If we become insolvent, cannot meet commercial diligence requirements contained in the license agreement, fail to make annual maintenance fee payments, or otherwise materially default without curing the default, the license agreement could be terminated. Furthermore, if we are successful in commercializing and selling the RAP device, we will owe milestone and royalty payments pursuant to this license agreement. If we fail to make those payments in accordance with the license agreement, our license could be terminated. If our license agreement with MD Anderson is terminated, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights.\nWe may from time to time seek to enforce our intellectual property rights against infringers when we determine that a successful outcome is probable and may lead to an increase in the value of the intellectual property. The validity of our patents and the patents we have licensed may be challenged in court and in administrative proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) and other patent offices outside the United States. These lawsuits and proceedings are expensive and would consume time and resources and divert the attention of managerial and scientific personnel even if we were successful in stopping the infringement of such patents. In addition, there is a risk that the court will decide that such patents are not valid and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the inventions. There is also the risk that, even if the validity of such patents is upheld, the court will refuse to stop the other party on the ground that such other party's activities do not infringe our intellectual property rights.\nIf we are unable to protect the intellectual property used in our products, others may be able to copy our innovations which may impair our ability to compete effectively in our markets.\nThe strength of our patents involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. We have eight families of patents. As of December 31, 2019, our patent portfolio is comprised of 11 pending U.S. patent applications, 28 granted and 59 pending foreign counterpart patent applications, and three pending PCT patent applications, each of which we either own directly or we are the exclusive licensee. These patent applications may be challenged or fail to result in issued patents, or if issued, these patents and our existing patents may be too narrow to prevent third-parties from developing or designing around our intellectual property and in that event, we may lose competitive advantage, which could result in harm to our business.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is common in the medical device industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other medical device companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may be subject to claims that these employees, or we, have used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to patented technology, we rely upon, among other things, unpatented proprietary technology, processes, trade secrets and know-how. Any involuntary disclosure to or misappropriation by third-parties of our confidential or proprietary information could enable competitors to duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, potentially eroding our competitive position in our market. We seek to protect confidential or proprietary information in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and third-parties. While we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third-parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information and technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot be certain that this know-how, information and technology will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. These agreements may be terminated or breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such termination or breach. Furthermore, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and know-how in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure.\nIf third parties claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights, we may be forced to expend significant financial resources and management time defending against such actions and our financial condition and our results of operations could suffer.\nThird parties may claim that our products infringe their patents and other intellectual property rights. Identifying third-party patent rights can be particularly difficult because, in general, patent applications can be maintained in secrecy for at least 18 months after their earliest priority date. Historically, there has been substantial litigation regarding patients and other intellectual property rights in the medical device and related industries. If a competitor were to challenge our patents, licenses or other intellectual property rights, or assert that our products infringe its patent or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial litigation costs, be forced to make expensive changes to our product design, pay royalties or other fees to license rights in order to continue manufacturing and selling our products, or pay substantial damages. Third-party infringement claims, regardless of their outcome, would not only consume our financial resources but also divert our management\u2019s time and effort.\nCyber security risks and cyber incidents could adversely affect our business and disrupt operations.\nCyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These incidents can include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. The result of these incidents could include, but are not limited to, disrupted operations, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cyber security protection costs, litigation and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence. We have implemented systems and processes to focus on identification, prevention, mitigation and resolution. However, these measures cannot provide absolute security, and our systems may be vulnerable to cyber-security breaches such as viruses, hacking, and similar disruptions from unauthorized intrusions. In addition, we may rely on third party service providers to perform certain services, such as payroll and tax services. Any failure of our systems or third-party systems may compromise our sensitive information and/or personally identifiable information of our employees. While we have secured cyber insurance to potentially cover certain risks associated with cyber incidents, there can be no assurance the insurance will be sufficient to cover any such liability.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be sporadically traded and volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors.\nSince our IPO in February 2019, our stock price has ranged from a high of $29.00 to a low of $4.12, the trading volume in our stock has been limited and sporadic, and the market price of our common stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also significantly affect the market price of our common stock.\nYour ownership may be diluted if additional capital stock is issued to raise capital, to finance acquisitions or in connection with strategic transactions.\nWe have in the past and intend in the future to raise funds, finance acquisitions or develop strategic relationships by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, which will reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders. Our board of directors has the authority, without action or vote of the stockholders, to issue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock. We are authorized to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock. Future issuances of common stock would reduce your influence over matters on which stockholders vote and would be dilutive to earnings per share.\nShares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants may substantially increase the number of shares available for sale in the public market and depress the price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had a material number of outstanding options and warrants to purchase shares of common stock. To the extent any of these options or warrants are exercised and any additional options or warrants are granted and exercised, there will be further dilution to stockholders and investors. Until the options and warrants expire, these holders will have an opportunity to profit from any increase in the market price of our common stock without assuming the risks of ownership. Holders of options and warrants may convert or exercise these securities at a time when we could obtain additional capital on terms more favorable than those provided by the options or warrants. The exercise of the options and warrants will dilute the voting interest of the owners of presently outstanding shares by adding a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock.\nThe concentration of our common stock ownership by a single shareholder will limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur largest shareholder, Remeditex Ventures, LLC (Remeditex), beneficially owns and will be able to vote in the aggregate a majority of our outstanding common stock. As such, Remeditex, will continue to have the ability to exert significant influence over all corporate activities, including the election or removal of directors and the outcome of tender offers, mergers, proxy contests or other purchases of common stock that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for their shares of common stock. This concentrated control will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that shareholders do not view as beneficial. In addition, such concentrated control could discourage others from initiating changes of control. In such cases, the perception of our prospects in the market may be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock may decline.\nCertain provisions in our organizational documents could enable our board of directors to prevent or delay a change of control.\nOur organizational documents contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of, or unsolicited acquisition proposals, that a stockholder might consider favorable. These include provisions:\n\u2022prohibiting the stockholders from acting by written consent;\n\u2022requiring advance notice of director nominations and of business to be brought before a meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022requiring a majority vote of the outstanding shares of common stock to amend the bylaws; and\n\u2022limiting the persons who may call special stockholders\u2019 meetings.\nIn addition, Delaware law makes it difficult for stockholders that recently have acquired a large interest in a corporation to cause the merger or acquisition of the corporation against the directors\u2019 wishes. Under Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, a Delaware corporation may not engage in any merger or other business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder except in limited circumstances, including by approval of the corporation\u2019s board of directors.\nWe have no intention of declaring dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe decision to pay cash dividends on our common stock rests with our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, unencumbered cash, capital requirements and financial condition. We do not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future, as we intend to use any excess cash to fund our operations. Investors in our common stock should not expect to receive dividend income on their investment, and investors will be dependent on the appreciation of our common stock to earn a return on their investment.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could cause our financial reports to be inaccurate.\nWe are required pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to assess and report on the effectiveness of those controls. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. Our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were, and continue to be, ineffective as of December 31, 2019. We identified material weaknesses in our internal controls due to the lack of segregation of duties, the\nlimitations of our financial accounting system to properly segregate duties and the absence of internal staff with extensive knowledge of SEC financial and GAAP reporting. While management is working to remediate these material weaknesses, there is no assurance that such changes, when economically feasible and sustainable, will remediate the identified material weaknesses or that the controls will prevent or detect future material weaknesses. If we are not able to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our financial statements, including related disclosures, may be inaccurate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to continue improving our accounting systems and controls could impair our ability to comply with the financial reporting and internal controls requirements for publicly traded companies.\nAs a public company, we operate in an increasingly demanding regulatory environment, which requires us to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the related rules and regulations of the SEC. Company responsibilities required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act include establishing corporate oversight and adequate internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud.\nManagement did elect to perform an annual assessment as of December 31, 2019 of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for our first annual report. Our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was, and continues to be, ineffective as of December 31, 2019, due to material weaknesses in our internal controls resulting from a lack of segregation of duties, the limitations of our financial accounting system, and the absence of internal staff with extensive knowledge of SEC financial and GAAP reporting. This annual assessment was performed earlier than required. Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, starting with the second annual report that we would expect to file with the SEC. However, for as long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, we have and intend to consider to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may continue to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and results of operations could be harmed and investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. We are an emerging growth company until the earliest of:\n\u2022the last day of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more;\n\u2022the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our IPO;\n\u2022the date on which we have, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; or\n\u2022the date on which we are deemed a \u201clarge accelerated issuer\u201d as defined under the federal securities laws.\nFor so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:\n\u2022have an auditor report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u2022comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis);\n\u2022submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholders advisory votes pursuant to the \u201csay on frequency\u201d and \u201csay on pay\u201d provisions (requiring a non-binding shareholder vote to approve compensation of certain executive officers) and the \u201csay on golden parachute\u201d provisions (requiring a non-binding shareholder vote to approve golden parachute arrangements for certain executive officers in connection with mergers and certain other business combinations) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010;\n\u2022include detailed compensation discussion and analysis in our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and instead may provide a reduced level of disclosure concerning executive compensation;\n\u2022present more than two years of audited financial statements or two years of related Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\"); and\n\u2022immediately adopt new or revised financial accounting standards under \u00a7107 of the JOBS Act; instead we are eligible to claim longer phase-in periods.\nWe intend to take advantage of all of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under \u00a7107 of the JOBS Act. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards, and, therefore, will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nCertain of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions were already available to us due to the fact that we also qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under SEC rules. For instance, smaller reporting companies are not required to obtain an auditor attestation and report regarding management\u2019s assessment of internal control over financial reporting; are not required to provide a compensation discussion and analysis; are not required to provide a pay-for-performance graph or CEO pay ratio disclosure; and may present only two years of audited financial statements and related MD&A disclosure.\nUnder the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of the above-described reduced reporting requirements and exemptions for up to five years after our initial sale of common equity pursuant to a registration statement declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, or such earlier time that we no longer meet the definition of an emerging growth company. Further, under current SEC rules, we will continue to qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d for so long as we have a public float (i.e., the market value of common equity held by non-affiliates) of less than $250 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our securities less attractive due to our reliance on these exemptions.\nSales of a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and principal stockholders, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. The 2,172,591 shares of our common stock sold in our IPO are freely tradable in the public market without restrictions or further registration except for any shares held by our affiliates, as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act). With respect to the remaining shares, our directors, executive officers and the holders of substantially all of our common stock outstanding prior to our IPO (or issued upon conversion of convertible securities in connection with our IPO) entered into lock-up agreements with us that, for a period of at least 90 days from the date of our IPO and ending one year from our IPO, or February 19, 2020, subject to certain exceptions, prohibit them from offering for sale, selling, contracting to sell, granting any option for the sale of, transferring or otherwise disposing of any shares of our common stock and of any securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock. Shares held by directors, executive officers, and other affiliates will also be subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act. As the applicable lock-up periods described above have expired, our security holders that were subject to a lock-up agreement are able to sell shares of our common stock in the public market. Sales of a substantial number of such shares or the perception that such sales may occur could cause our market price to fall or make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate.\nTechniques employed by short sellers have in the past and may in the future drive down the market price of our common stock.\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed from a third-party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is in the short seller\u2019s best interests for the price of the stock to decline, many short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, negative opinions regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling a stock short. These short attacks have led to selling of shares in the market. Issuers such as Soliton, that have common stock with limited trading volumes and/or have been susceptible to relatively high volatility levels, can be particularly vulnerable to such short seller attacks. In May 2019, our common stock was the subject of a report by a short seller\nthat contained incorrect and misleading information, which report led to a severe decline in our stock price. Although we timely responded to these false and misleading allegations, we cannot assure you that such similar false and misleading articles will not be published again in the future. The publication of any such articles regarding us in the future may bring about a temporary, or possibly long term, decline in the market price of our common stock. If we continue to be the subject of unfavorable allegations, we may have to expend a significant amount of resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend ourselves. While we would strongly defend against any such short seller attacks, we may be constrained in the manner in which we can proceed against the relevant short seller by applicable state law or issues of commercial confidentiality. Such a situation could be costly and time-consuming, and could be distracting for our management team.", "PERMNO": 18414, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "SOLY"}
