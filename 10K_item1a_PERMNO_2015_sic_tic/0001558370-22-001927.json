Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as all other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements, the notes thereto and the section entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, operating results, prospects and ability to accomplish our strategic objectives could be materially harmed. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations and the market price of our common stock.\nRisk Factors Summary\nOur business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those risks discussed at length below. These risks include, among others, the following principal risk factors that make an investment in our company speculative or risky. You are encouraged to carefully review our full discussion of the material risk factors relevant to an investment in our business, which follows the brief bulleted list of our principal risk factors set forth below:\n\u25cf Our ability to maintain profitability is dependent upon our ability to continue successfully commercializing our products and any products and future product candidates, if approved, that we may develop or acquire in the future. Our failure to do so successfully could impair our growth strategy and plans and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results;\n\u25cf We have substantial outstanding indebtedness, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u25cf If we cannot continue successfully commercializing Xtampza ER or the Nucynta Products, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and the price of our common stock may decline;\n\u25cf Despite receiving approval by the FDA, additional data may emerge that could change the FDA\u2019s position on product labeling of Xtampza ER and our ability to market Xtampza ER successfully may be adversely affected;\n\u25cf Xtampza ER and the Nucynta Products are subject to mandatory REMS programs, which could increase the cost, burden and liability associated with the commercialization of these products;\n\u25cf We could fail to promote Xtampza ER\u2019s abuse deterrent labeling in compliance with FDA regulations;\n\u25cf Failure to comply with ongoing governmental regulations for marketing any product, including Xtampza ER and the Nucynta Products, could delay or inhibit our ability to generate revenues from their sale and could also expose us to claims or other sanctions.\n\u25cf Unfavorable outcomes in intellectual property litigation could be costly and potentially limit our ability to commercialize our products;\n\u25cf If we are unable to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights for our technologies, products or any future product candidates which we may develop, we may lose valuable assets or be unable to compete effectively in our market;\n\u25cf We have been, and may continue to be, forced to litigate to enforce or defend our intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful, and result in the loss of valuable assets;\n\u25cf Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submissions, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\n\u25cf If we are unable to utilize our own sales and marketing capabilities successfully or enter into strategic alliances with marketing collaborators, we may not continue to be successful in commercializing our products and may be unable to generate sufficient product revenue;\n\u25cf If the medical community, patients, and healthcare payors do not accept and use our products, we will not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer;\n\u25cf Our products contain, and our future product candidates may contain, controlled substances, the manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation and distribution of which are subject to regulation by state and federal law enforcement and other regulatory agencies;\n\u25cf Current and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to continue to commercialize our products and may reduce the prices we are able to obtain for our products;\n\u25cf Our products may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations or third-party coverage and reimbursement policies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Such pricing regulations may address the rebates that manufacturers offer to pharmaceutical benefit managers, or the discounts that manufacturers provide others within the pharmaceutical distribution chain;\n\u25cf Social issues around the abuse of opioids, including law enforcement concerns over diversion of opioids and regulatory and enforcement efforts to combat abuse, could decrease the potential market for our products and may adversely impact external investor perceptions of our business;\n\u25cf If the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities approve generic products with abuse deterrent claims that compete with our products, our sales could decline;\n\u25cf If the third-party manufacturers of Xtampza ER or the Nucynta Products fail to devote sufficient time and resources to these products, or their performance is substandard, and/or we encounter challenges with our dedicated manufacturing suite at our third-party manufacturer\u2019s site for the manufacturing of Xtampza ER, our costs may be higher than expected and could have a material adverse effect on our business;\n\u25cf Because we currently rely on a sole supplier to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient of our products, any production problems with our supplier could have a material adverse effect on us;\n\u25cf We depend on wholesale pharmaceutical distributors for retail distribution of our products; if we lose any of our significant wholesale pharmaceutical distributors or their distribution network is disrupted, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected;\n\u25cf Our products could be subject to post-marketing requirements, which requirements may, in some cases, not be capable of timely or satisfactory completion without participation in consortia over which we have limited control;\n\u25cf The announcement and pendency of our acquisition of BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. (\u201cBDSI\u201d) may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows;\n\u25cf Our ability to realize the benefits of the acquisition of BDSI is substantially dependent on the projected cost savings resulting from the timely and effective integration of the operations of Collegium and BDSI;\n\u25cf Our business may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf Litigation or regulatory action regarding opioid medications could negatively affect our business;\n\u25cf We face substantial competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products more successfully than we do;\n\u25cf Commercial sales of our products, and clinical trials of our products and any future product candidates, may expose us to expensive product liability claims, and we may not be able to maintain product liability insurance on reasonable terms or at all.\n\u25cf Our relationships with customers and payors are subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency, and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, exclusion from government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, and diminished profits and future earnings; and\n\u25cf The price of our common stock may be volatile and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Needs\nOur ability to maintain profitability is dependent upon our ability to continue successfully commercializing our products and any products and future product candidates, if approved, that we may develop or acquire in the future. Our failure to do so successfully could impair our growth strategy and plans and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results.\nOur ability to maintain profitability depends upon our ability to realize the full commercial potential of our products and to commercialize successfully any other products and future product candidates, if approved, that we may develop, in-license or acquire in the future. Our ability to generate revenue from our current or future products depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u25cf realize a commercially viable price for our products;\n\u25cf manufacture commercial quantities of our products at acceptable cost levels;\n\u25cf sustain a commercial organization capable of sales, marketing and distribution for the products we sell;\n\u25cf obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third parties, including government payors; and\n\u25cf comply with existing and changing laws and regulations that apply to the pharmaceutical industry, including opioid manufacturers, and to our products specifically, including FDA post-marketing requirements.\nIf we fail to maintain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had a federal net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforward of approximately $119.3 million and state NOL carryovers of approximately $103.0 million, which are available to offset future taxable income. The U.S. federal and state NOL carryforwards expire at various dates through 2036. We also had U.S. federal tax credits of approximately $4.5 million, and state tax credits of approximately $1.0 million. These tax attributes are generally subject to a limited carryover/carryback period and are also subject to the annual limitations that may be imposed under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. During the three months ended June 30, 2021, the Company released the portion of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets expected to be realized through future earnings. Refer to Note 16, Income Taxes, for more information.\nWe have outstanding indebtedness in the form of our 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes and our Loan Agreement with BioPharma, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn February 2020, in connection with the Nucynta Acquisition, we incurred (i) $143.8 million in principal amount of indebtedness in the form of 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2026 (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d) and (ii) $200.0 million in secured indebtedness pursuant to our Loan Agreement with BioPharma Credit PLC, as collateral agent and lender, and BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP, as lender (as amended from time to time, the \u201cLoan Agreement\u201d). In addition, in connection with the announcement of the BDSI Acquisition, we entered into a commitment letter with Pharmakon Advisors, L.P. pursuant to which funds managed by Pharmakon Advisors, L.P. have committed, subject to customary conditions, to provide to us a four (4) year senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $650.0 million. We may also incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. Our existing and future levels of indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for our security holders and our business, results of operations and financial condition by, among other things:\n\u25cf\nrequiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of cash available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes;\n\u25cf\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u25cf\nlimiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business;\n\u25cf\ndiluting the interests of our existing shareholders as a result of issuing shares of our common stock upon conversion of the convertible notes;\n\u25cf\nplacing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with competitors that are less leveraged than we are or have better access to capital;\n\u25cf\nincreasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general, including any such downturn related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHolders of our Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase our Convertible Notes for cash following a fundamental change, or to pay any cash amounts due upon conversion of our Convertible Notes. Further, our noteholders, subject to a limited exception described in the notes, may require us to repurchase their notes following a fundamental change at a cash repurchase price generally equal to the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion, we will satisfy part or all of our conversion obligation in cash unless we elect to settle conversions solely in shares of our common stock. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase the notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. Applicable law, regulatory authorities and the agreements governing our other indebtedness may restrict our ability to repurchase the notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. Additionally, our Loan Agreement contains certain covenants and obligations applicable to us, including, without limitation, covenants that require us and our subsidiaries to maintain $200 million in annual net sales and covenants that limit our ability to incur\nadditional indebtedness or liens, make acquisitions or other investments or dispose of assets outside the ordinary course of business.\nFailure to comply with covenants in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes or in the Loan Agreement would constitute an event of default under these instruments, notwithstanding our ability to meet our debt service obligations. Our failure to repurchase notes or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion when required will constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our other indebtedness, which may result in that other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. In such event, we may not have sufficient funds to satisfy all amounts due under our other indebtedness (including the Loan Agreement) and the notes. The Loan Agreement includes various customary remedies for the lenders following an event of default, including the acceleration of repayment of outstanding amounts under the Loan Agreement and execution upon the collateral securing obligations under the Loan Agreement. If we fail to comply with such covenants and terms, we may be in default and the maturity of the related debt could be accelerated and become immediately due and payable. In addition, because our assets are pledged as a security under the Loan Agreement, if we are not able to cure any default or repay outstanding borrowings, our assets are subject to the risk of foreclosure by our lenders. Moreover, a default on indebtedness under the Loan Agreement could result in a default under the terms of the indenture governing our Convertible Notes. There is no guarantee that we would be able to satisfy our obligations if any of our indebtedness is accelerated.\nRisks Related to our Products\nIf we cannot continue successfully commercializing Xtampza ER or the Nucynta Products, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and the price of our common stock may decline.\nTo date, we have invested substantial resources in the development of Xtampza ER, which has been approved by the FDA. In February 2018, we began marketing the Nucynta Products. Our business and future success are substantially dependent on our ability to continue successfully commercializing these products.\nOur ability to continue successfully commercializing Xtampza ER and the Nucynta Products will depend on many factors, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf our ability to manufacture commercial quantities of Xtampza ER at reasonable cost and with sufficient speed to meet commercial demand;\n\u25cf our ability to execute sales and marketing strategies successfully and continually;\n\u25cf our success in educating physicians, patients and caregivers about the benefits, administration, use and coverage of our products;\n\u25cf the perceived availability and advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of other abuse-deterrent products and treatments with similar indications;\n\u25cf our ability to defend successfully any challenges to our intellectual property or suits asserting patent infringement relating to our products;\n\u25cf the availability and quality of coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products;\n\u25cf a continued acceptable safety profile of our products; and\n\u25cf our ability to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, including any additional manufacturing or packaging requirements that may become applicable to certain opioid products.\nMany of these matters are beyond our control and are subject to other risks described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue successfully commercializing or to generate sufficient revenue from our products. If we cannot do so, or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nDespite receiving approval by the FDA, additional data may emerge that could change the FDA\u2019s position on the product labeling of Xtampza ER and our ability to market Xtampza ER successfully may be adversely affected.\nXtampza ER was approved with label language describing abuse-deterrent properties of the formulation with respect to the nasal and IV routes of abuse, consistent with Guidance for Industry, \u201cAbuse-Deterrent Opioids- Evaluation and Labeling.\u201d In November 2017, the FDA approved an sNDA for Xtampza ER to include comparative oral pharmacokinetic data from a clinical study evaluating the effect of physical manipulation by crushing Xtampza ER\ncompared with OxyContin and a control (oxycodone hydrochloride immediate-release), results from an oral human abuse potential study and the addition of an oral abuse deterrent claim.\nThe FDA can require changes to the product labeling for Xtampza ER or the Nucynta Products at any time which can impact our ability to generate product sales. In particular, if the FDA determines that our post-marketing data for Xtampza ER does not demonstrate that the abuse-deterrent properties result in reduction of abuse, or demonstrates a shift to routes of abuse that present a greater risk, the FDA may find that product labeling revisions are needed, and potentially require the removal of our abuse-deterrence claims, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue successfully commercializing Xtampza ER.\nXtampza ER and the Nucynta Products are subject to mandatory REMS programs, which could increase the cost, burden and liability associated with the commercialization of these products.\nThe FDA has imposed a class-wide REMS on all IR, ER and long-acting opioid drug products (known as the Opioid Analgesic REMS). The FDA continually evaluates whether the REMS program is meeting its goal of ensuring that the benefit of these drugs continue to outweigh their risks, and whether the goals or elements of the program should be modified. Any modification of the Opioid Analgesic REMS by the FDA to impose additional or more burdensome requirements could increase the costs associated with marketing our products and/or reduce the willingness of healthcare providers to prescribe our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to successfully commercialize and generate sufficient revenue from our products.\nWe could fail to promote Xtampza ER\u2019s abuse deterrent labeling in compliance with FDA regulations.\nXtampza ER has FDA-approved product labeling that describes its abuse deterrent features, which allows us to promote those features and differentiate Xtampza ER from other opioid products containing the same active pharmaceutical ingredients. Because the FDA closely regulates promotional materials and other promotional activities, even though the FDA approved product labeling includes a description of the abuse deterrent characteristics of Xtampza ER, the FDA may object to our marketing claims and product advertising campaigns. This could lead to the issuance of warning letters or untitled letters, suspension or withdrawal of our products from the market, recalls, fines, disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions, and civil or criminal prosecution. Any of these consequences would harm the commercial success of Xtampza ER.\nFailure to comply with ongoing governmental regulations for marketing any product, including Xtampza ER and the Nucynta Products, could delay or inhibit our ability to generate revenues from their sale and could also expose us to claims or other sanctions.\nAdvertising and promotion of any pharmaceutical product marketed in the United States, including Xtampza ER and the Nucynta Products, is heavily scrutinized by, among others, the FDA, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d), state attorneys general, members of Congress and the public. Violations, including promotion of our products for unapproved or off-label uses, are subject to enforcement letters, inquiries and investigations, and civil and criminal sanctions by the FDA or other government agencies.\nEngaging in off-label promotion of our products could also subject us to false claims liability under federal and state statutes, and other litigation and/or investigations, which could lead to civil and criminal penalties and fines, and could also require us to enter into agreements that materially restrict the manner in which we promote or distribute our drug products.\nIn addition, after product approval, subsequent discovery of serious and unanticipated adverse events associated with the product; the emergence of other problems with the product, manufacturer or facility; or our failure to make required regulatory submissions may result in adverse regulatory actions, including withdrawal of the product from the market or the requirement to add or strengthen label warnings about the product. The failure to obtain or maintain requisite governmental approvals or the imposition of additional or stronger warnings could delay or preclude us from further developing, marketing or realizing the full commercial potential of our products.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nUnfavorable outcomes in intellectual property litigation could be costly and potentially limit our ability to commercialize our products.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability to commercialize products without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. Our current or future products, or any uses of them, may now or in the future infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property rights. We cannot currently determine the ultimate scope and validity of patents which may be granted to third parties in the future or which patents might be asserted to be infringed by the manufacture, use and sale of our products.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing or commercializing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, in any such proceeding or litigation, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our products or force us to cease some of our business operations.\nAny litigation, including any interference or derivation proceedings to determine priority of inventions, oppositions or other post-grant review proceedings to patents in the United States, or litigation against our collaborators may be costly and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition. We expect that litigation may be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights. Litigation may be necessary in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. Ultimately, the outcome of such litigation, including our pending litigation with Purdue, could compromise the validity and scope of our patents or other proprietary rights or hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products.\nIf we are unable to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights for our technologies, products or any future product candidates which we may develop, we may lose valuable assets or be unable to compete effectively in our market.\nWe depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on patent and trademark laws, unpatented trade secrets and know-how, and confidentiality, licensing and other agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States with respect to our proprietary technology and products.\nThe steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights in the United States. The rights already granted under any of our currently issued patents and those that may be granted under future issued patents may not provide us with the proprietary protection or competitive advantages we are seeking.\nWe have been, and may continue to be, forced to litigate to enforce or defend our intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful, and result in the loss of valuable assets.\nWe have been, and may continue to be, forced to litigate to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights against infringement and unauthorized use by competitors, and to protect our trade secrets. In so doing, we may place our intellectual property at risk of being invalidated, rendered unenforceable or limited or narrowed in scope.\nThis litigation is expensive and time consuming. Many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to defend their intellectual property rights than we can.\nAccordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition. In addition, an adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and products, we rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts in the United States may be less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such competitor, or those with whom they communicate, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed or independently developed, our competitive position would be harmed.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submissions, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO requires compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In addition, periodic maintenance fees on issued patents are required to be paid to the USPTO in several stages over the lifetime of the patents. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees, and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our products, our competitive position would be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization of Our Products\nIf we are unable to utilize our own sales and marketing capabilities successfully or enter into strategic alliances with marketing collaborators, we may not continue to be successful in commercializing our products and may be unable to generate sufficient product revenue.\nOur commercial organization continues to evolve and we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be successful in marketing our products. In addition, we compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with extensive and well-funded sales and marketing operations to recruit, hire, train and retain sales and marketing personnel. If we are unable to continue to grow and maintain adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate sufficient product revenue and may not remain profitable. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to continue successfully commercializing our products in the United States include:\n\u25cf our inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u25cf the inability of sales personnel to reach adequate numbers of physicians who may prescribe our products; and\n\u25cf unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating and maintaining an independent sales and marketing organization.\nIf we are not successful in retaining sales and marketing personnel or in maintaining our sales and marketing infrastructure or if we do not preserve strategic alliances with marketing collaborators, agreements with contract sales organizations or collaboration arrangements, we will have difficulty in continuing to commercialize our products.\nAdditionally, our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities may be hindered as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. The safety and well-being of our employees is our highest priority and we expect to maintain mitigating measures until such time as mandated closures or other restrictions are lifted and public health officials change their recommendations, and we have, and will continue to, equip our personnel with the tools and resources needed to effectively continue their sales and marketing efforts in a manner that complies with all relevant regulations, whether in person or from a remote setting. We face the risk, however, that limitations on activities within the healthcare sector and on economic activity\ngenerally will impede our ability to continue successfully commercializing our products. Notwithstanding the lifting of some COVID-19 restrictions in many jurisdictions, and amidst continuing public health concerns relating to the spread of COVID-19, particularly variants thereof, weekly pain patient office visits continue to be depressed compared to pre-COVID periods, which we believe in turn may account for fewer patients beginning therapy with our products. We believe that the disruptions caused by COVID-19 will continue and there remains substantial uncertainty as to when such disruptions will cease. If we are unable to successfully commercialize our products during the COVID-19 outbreak, our ability to generate sufficient product revenue may be adversely affected.\nIf the medical community, patients, and healthcare payors do not accept and use our products, we will not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer.\nPhysicians and others in the medical community, patients, and healthcare payors may not accept and use our products. Acceptance and use of our products will depend on a number of factors including:\n\u25cf\napproved indications, warnings and precautions language that may be less desirable than competitive products;\n\u25cf\nperceptions of physicians and other healthcare community members of the safety and efficacy of our products;\n\u25cf\nperceptions by members of the healthcare community, including physicians, about the relevance and efficacy of our abuse deterrent technology;\n\u25cf\nthe availability of competitive products;\n\u25cf\nthe pricing and cost-effectiveness of our products relative to competing products;\n\u25cf\nthe potential and perceived advantages of our products over alternative treatments;\n\u25cf\nthe convenience and ease of administration to patients of our products;\n\u25cf\nactual and perceived availability and quality of coverage and reimbursement for our products from government or other third-party payors;\n\u25cf\nnegative publicity related to our products or negative or positive publicity related to our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u25cf\nthe prevalence and severity of adverse side effects;\n\u25cf\npolicy initiatives by FDA, HHS, DEA, or other federal or state agencies regarding opioids;\n\u25cf\nour ability to comply with the Opioid Analgesic REMS; and\n\u25cf\nthe effectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and any licensees and distributors.\nIf our products fail to have an adequate level of acceptance by the medical community, patients, or healthcare payors, we will not be able to generate sufficient revenue to remain profitable. Since we expect to rely on sales generated by Xtampza ER and the Nucynta Products for substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future, the failure of Xtampza ER or the Nucynta Products to maintain market acceptance would harm our business prospects.\nOur products contain, and our future product candidates may contain, controlled substances, the manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation and distribution of which are subject to regulation by state and federal law enforcement and other regulatory agencies.\nOur products contain, and our future product candidates may contain, controlled substances that are subject to state and federal laws and regulations regarding their manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation and distribution. Xtampza ER\u2019s active ingredient, oxycodone, and the Nucynta Products\u2019 active ingredient, tapentadol, are both classified as Schedule II controlled substances under the CSA and regulations of the DEA. A number of states also independently regulate these drugs, including oxycodone and tapentadol, as controlled substances. We and our suppliers, manufacturers, contractors, customers and distributors are required to obtain and maintain applicable registrations from state and federal law enforcement and regulatory agencies and comply with state and federal laws and regulations regarding the manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation and distribution of controlled substances.\nFurthermore, the amount of Schedule II substances that can be obtained for clinical trials and commercial distribution is limited by the CSA and DEA regulations. For more information, see the section in our Annual Report entitled \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation-DEA and Opioid Regulation.\u201d We may not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of these controlled substances in order to meet commercial demand. If commercial demand for Xtampza ER, or any of our other approved products, increases and we cannot meet such demand in a timely fashion because of our limited supply of its active pharmaceutical ingredient (in the case of Xtampza ER, oxycodone) then physicians may perceive such product as unavailable and may be less likely to prescribe it in the future.\nIn addition, controlled substances are also subject to regulations governing manufacturing, labeling, packaging, testing,\ndispensing, production and procurement quotas, recordkeeping, reporting, handling, shipment and disposal. These regulations increase the personnel needs and the expense associated with development and commercialization of our products that include controlled substances. The DEA and some states conduct periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances.\nFailure to obtain and maintain required registrations or to comply with any applicable regulations could delay or preclude us from developing and commercializing our products that contain controlled substances and subject us to enforcement action. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In some circumstances, violations could lead to criminal proceedings. Because of their restrictive nature, these regulations could limit commercialization of our products containing controlled substances.\nCurrent and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to continue to commercialize our products and may reduce the prices we are able to obtain for our products.\nIn the United States, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system generally, and the manufacturing, distribution, and marketing of opioids in particular, that could prevent or delay marketing approval of future product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities or affect our ability to profitably sell our products for which we obtain marketing approval. For example, several states, including New York, have recently imposed taxes or fees on the sale of opioids. Other states, and even the federal government, as proposed in the LifeBOAT Act introduced by a bipartisan group of Senators in May 2021, could impose similar taxes or fees, and such laws and proposals can vary in the tax and fee amounts imposed and the means of calculation. Liabilities for taxes or assessments under any such laws could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nCalifornia and several other states have enacted legislation related to prescription drug pricing transparency and it is unclear the effect this legislation will have on our business. Laws intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for health care and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms may continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing of our products may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nOur products may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations or third-party coverage and reimbursement policies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Such pricing regulations may address the rebates that manufacturers offer to pharmaceutical benefit managers, or the discounts that manufacturers provide others within the pharmaceutical distribution chain.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drug products can vary widely. Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in our products.\nOur ability to commercialize any product successfully will also depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors determine which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels and tiers of preference based on the perceived value and innovation of a given product. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications and establishing administrative hurdles that incentivize use of generic and/or lower cost products first. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with discounts and rebates from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We have agreed to provide such discounts and rebates to certain third-party payors. We expect increasing pressure to offer larger discounts and rebates. Additionally, a greater number of third-party payors may seek discounts and rebates in order to\noffer or maintain access for our products. We cannot be sure that high-quality coverage and reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be and whether it will be satisfactory.\nReimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to expand and maintain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for our products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to continue to commercialize our products and our overall financial condition.\nThe Affordable Care Act and any changes in healthcare law may increase the difficulty and cost for us to continue to commercialize our products and affect the prices we may obtain.\nThe United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system that may affect our ability to profitably sell our product and product candidates, if approved. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments also have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs.\nThe Affordable Care Act was intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. There have been significant ongoing judicial, administrative, executive and legislative efforts to modify or eliminate the Affordable Care Act, and the Affordable Care Act has also been subject to challenges in the courts. See the section in our Annual Report entitled \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation-Healthcare Reform.\u201d\nFurther changes to and under the Affordable Care Act remain possible, although the new Biden administration has signaled that it plans to build on the Affordable Care Act and expand the number of people who are eligible for subsidies under it. President Biden indicated that he intends to use executive orders to undo changes to the Affordable Care Act made by the Trump administration and would advocate for legislation to build on the Affordable Care Act. It is unknown what form any such changes or any law proposed to replace the Affordable Care Act would take, and how or whether it may affect our business in the future. We expect that changes to the Affordable Care Act, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, changes allowing the federal government to directly negotiate drug prices and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry.\nAny reduction in reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue and maintain profitability.\nSocial issues around the abuse of opioids, including law enforcement concerns over diversion of opioids and regulatory and enforcement efforts to combat abuse, could decrease the potential market for our products and may adversely impact external investor perceptions of our business.\nLaw enforcement and regulatory agencies may apply policies and guidelines that seek to limit the availability or use of opioids. Such efforts may inhibit our ability to continue to commercialize our products.\nAggressive enforcement and unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, the use or misuse of oxycodone or other opioid drugs; the limitations of abuse-resistant formulations; the ability of people who abuse drugs to discover previously unknown ways to abuse opioid drugs, including Xtampza ER and the Nucynta Products; public inquiries and investigations into prescription drug abuse; litigation; or regulatory activity regarding sales, marketing, distribution or storage of opioid drugs could have a material adverse effect on our reputation. Such negative publicity could reduce the potential size of the market for our products, decrease the revenues we are able to generate from their sale and adversely\nimpact external investor perceptions of our business. Similarly, to the extent opioid abuse becomes less prevalent or less urgent of a public health issue, regulators and third party payers may not be willing to pay a premium for abuse-deterrent formulations of opioid.\nFederal laws have been enacted to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and illicit opioid use, including the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act and the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act. These laws are described in more detail under the caption \u201cBusiness- Governmental Regulation - DEA and Opioid Regulation.\u201d\nIf the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities approve generic products with abuse deterrent claims that compete with our products, our sales could decline.\nOnce an NDA, including a Section 505(b)(2) application, is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a \u201clisted drug\u201d which can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, FDA regulations and other applicable regulations and policies provide incentives to manufacturers to create modified, non-infringing versions of a drug to facilitate the approval of an ANDA or other application for generic substitutes. These generic equivalents would be significantly less costly than ours to bring to market and companies that produce generic equivalents are generally able to offer their products at lower prices. Thus, after the introduction of a generic competitor, a significant percentage of the sales of any branded product are typically lost to the generic product. Accordingly, competition from generic equivalents to our products would substantially limit our ability to generate revenues and therefore to obtain a return on the investments we have made in our products. In November 2017, FDA issued a final guidance to assist industry in the development of generic versions of approved opioids with abuse-deterrent formulations, including recommendations about the types of studies that companies should conduct to demonstrate that the generic drug is no less abuse-deterrent than its brand-name counterpart. In the second half of 2018, the FDA posted three revised product-specific guidances related to generic abuse-deterrent opioid formulations, including one guidance specifically relating to Xtampza ER, which recommend specific in vivo studies and in vitro study considerations for abuse deterrence evaluations. These guidances are part of FDA\u2019s wider focus on assisting developers of generic abuse-deterrent formulations navigate the regulatory path to market more quickly. Earlier market entry of generic abuse-deterrent formulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nIf the third-party manufacturers of Xtampza ER or the Nucynta Products fail to devote sufficient time and resources to these products, or their performance is substandard, and/or we encounter challenges with our dedicated manufacturing suite at our third-party manufacturer\u2019s site for the manufacturing of Xtampza ER, our costs may be higher than expected and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe do not own any manufacturing facilities in drug development and commercial manufacturing. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing facility and do not have the resources and expertise to manufacture and test, on a commercial scale, the technical performance of our products. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on a limited number of experienced personnel and contract manufacturers for our products, as well as other vendors to formulate, test, supply, store and distribute our products, and we control only certain aspects of their activities.\nIn 2020, we completed the build-out of a dedicated manufacturing suite at a site operated by our contract manufacturing organization, Patheon, part of Thermo Fisher Scientific. This facility requires the maintenance of regulatory approvals and other costs, all of which we will need to absorb. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to leverage the dedicated manufacturing suite in a profitable manner. If the demand for Xtampza ER and any future related products never meets our expectations and forecasts, or if we do not produce the output we plan, we may not be able to realize the return on investment we anticipated, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have initiated the activities required to transition commercial manufacturing for Nucynta ER from Janssen to Patheon, which is an assumed obligation of the Nucynta Commercialization Agreement. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our efforts to demonstrate equivalence of product manufactured by Patheon with product manufactured by Janssen, and we may encounter delays in obtaining regulatory approval for Patheon as a new manufacturer and supplier of Nucynta ER. Additionally, we may be unsuccessful in validation activities, which could lead to delays in the transfer of manufacturing obligations, higher costs of validation, and/or rejection of otherwise saleable batches of Nucynta ER,\nall of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Even if we are successful in our regulatory approval and validation activities, we could encounter issues in obtaining commercial supply from Patheon's facility due to technical problems or challenges obtaining adequate and/or timely DEA procurement quota.\nAlthough we have identified alternate sources for these services, it would be time-consuming, and require us to incur additional cost, to qualify these sources. Our reliance on a limited number of vendors and, in particular, Patheon as our single manufacturer for Xtampza ER and the future manufacturer of Nucynta ER, exposes us to the following risks, any of which could impact commercialization of our products, result in higher costs, or deprive us of potential product revenues:\n\u25cf Our contract manufacturer, or other third parties we rely on, may encounter difficulties in achieving the volume of production needed to satisfy commercial demand, may experience technical issues that impact quality or compliance with applicable and strictly enforced regulations governing the manufacture of pharmaceutical products, may be affected by natural disasters that interrupt or prevent manufacturing of our products including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, may experience shortages of qualified personnel to adequately staff production operations, may experience shortages of raw materials and may have difficulties finding replacement parts or equipment.\n\u25cf Our contract manufacturer could default on their agreement with us to meet our requirements for commercial supplies of our products and/or we could experience technical problems in the operation of our dedicated manufacturing suite.\n\u25cf The use of alternate manufacturers may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers that have the necessary governmental licenses to produce narcotic products is limited. Additionally, the FDA and the DEA must approve any alternative manufacturer of our products, before we may use the alternative manufacturer to produce commercial supplies.\n\u25cf It may be difficult or impossible for us to find a replacement manufacturer on acceptable terms quickly, or at all. Our contract manufacturer and vendors may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to produce, store and distribute our products successfully.\n\u25cf If our contract manufacturer were to terminate our arrangement or fail to meet our commercial manufacturing demands, we may be forced to delay our development and commercial programs.\nFailure to obtain the necessary active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients or components necessary to manufacture our products could adversely affect our ability to continue to commercialize the product, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Certain components of Xtampza ER are naturally derived products, for which we rely on sole suppliers. The inability of any of our raw material suppliers to provide components that meet our specifications and requirements could adversely impact our ability to manufacture our product. Furthermore, the quota procurement process limits the amount of DEA-controlled active pharmaceutical ingredient we have available for manufacture. Consequently, we are limited in our ability to execute a business strategy that builds appreciable safety stock of finished drug product.\nOur reliance on third parties reduces our control over our development and commercialization activities but does not relieve us of our responsibility to ensure compliance with all required legal, regulatory and scientific standards. The FDA and other regulatory authorities require our products to be manufactured according to cGMP. Any failure by our third-party manufacturer to comply with cGMP or failure to scale up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities of products in a timely manner, could lead to a shortage of commercial product. Such failure could also be the basis for the FDA to issue a warning or untitled letter, withdraw approvals for products previously granted to us, or take other regulatory or legal action, including recall or seizure, total or partial suspension of production, suspension of ongoing clinical trials, refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, detention of product, refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunction, imposing civil penalties or pursuing criminal prosecution.\nAny stock out, or failure to obtain sufficient supplies of any of our products, or the necessary active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients or components necessary to manufacture each of our products, could adversely affect our ability to commercialize such products, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause we currently rely on a sole supplier to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient of our products, any production problems with our supplier could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe presently depend upon a single supplier for the active pharmaceutical ingredient for Xtampza ER (oxycodone base)\nand the Nucynta Products (tapentadol), and we contract with this supplier for commercial supply to manufacture our products. Further, our sole supplier also supplies our primary competitor in the extended-release oxycodone space, Purdue. Although we have identified an alternate source for oxycodone base for Xtampza ER, it would be time-consuming and costly to qualify this source. Any changes that our supplier makes to the respective drug substance raw materials, intermediates, or manufacturing processes would introduce technical and regulatory risks to our downstream drug product supply. If our supplier were to terminate an arrangement for an active pharmaceutical ingredient, or fail to meet our supply needs (including as a result of disruptions in personnel or the global supply chain resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak), we might incur substantial costs and be forced to delay our development or commercialization programs. Any such delay could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nManufacturing issues may arise that could increase product and regulatory approval costs, delay commercialization or limit commercial supply.\nIn our current commercial manufacturing operations, and as we scale up manufacturing of our products and conduct required stability testing, we may encounter product, packaging, equipment and process-related issues that may require refinement or resolution in order to proceed with our planned clinical trials, obtain regulatory approval for commercial marketing and build commercial supplies. In the future, we may identify impurities, which could result in increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities, delays in our clinical programs and regulatory approval, increases in our operating expenses, failure to obtain or maintain approval or limitations in our commercial supply.\nWe depend on wholesale pharmaceutical distributors for retail distribution of our products; if we lose any of our significant wholesale pharmaceutical distributors or their distribution network is disrupted, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nA significant percentage of our product shipments are to a limited number of independent wholesale pharmaceutical distributors. Three of our wholesale pharmaceutical distributors represented 35%, 31% and 29% of our product shipments for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our loss of any of these wholesale pharmaceutical distributors\u2019 accounts, or a material reduction in their purchases or a significant disruption to transportation infrastructure or other means of distribution of our products, including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. The significance of each wholesale pharmaceutical distributor account to our business adversely impacts our ability to negotiate favorable commercial terms with each such distributor, and as a result, we may be forced to accept terms that adversely impact our results of operations.\nIn addition, these wholesaler customers comprise a significant part of the distribution network for pharmaceutical products in the United States. This distribution network has undergone, and may continue to undergo, significant consolidation marked by mergers and acquisitions. As a result, a small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the market. Consolidation of drug wholesalers has increased, and may continue to increase, competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical products. We cannot guarantee that we can manage these pricing pressures or that wholesaler purchases will not fluctuate unexpectedly from period to period. In addition, due to unprecedented and significant disruptions in the processing of product returns by wholesale pharmaceutical distributors, as further disclosed in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the Company formally denied a significant portion of unprocessed product claims under the Company\u2019s return policy. The Company subsequently received payment for only a portion of the denied claims and intends to vigorously pursue collections of the full amount of these short-pay receivables. Additional unprocessed return claims have and are expected to continue to expire prior to their physical return. Although the Company has and expects to continue to deny credit for product returns that are not in accordance with its return policy, uncertainty exists related to the ultimate resolution of these claims. We intend to pursue vigorously collections of the full amount of the receivable, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so or that similar disruptions in the wholesaler distribution network will not occur in the future.\nOur products could be subject to post-marketing requirements, which requirements may, in some cases, not be capable of timely or satisfactory completion without participation in consortia over which we have limited control.\nOur products are subject to a comprehensive regulatory scheme, including post-marketing requirements (\u201cPMRs\u201d) to conduct epidemiological studies and clinical trials. We intend to fulfill our PMRs by virtue of our participation in the Opioid PMR Consortium (\u201cOPC\u201d). Although we retain discretion in how to discharge such PMRs, the scale and scope of\nthe studies required by the FDA make it cost prohibitive to discharge these requirements other than by joining the OPC that was formed to conduct them. We are a member of OPC and engage in decision-making as a member of that organization, but do not have a majority. If the OPC fails to conduct sufficiently rigorous studies or is unable to achieve the patient enrollment or other requirements established by the FDA, we may be unable to satisfy our PMRs and the FDA may choose to withdraw or otherwise restrict its approval of our products. Such withdrawal or restriction would have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our non-clinical and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, or if they terminate their agreement with us, we may not be able to maintain regulatory approval for our products and our business could suffer a material adverse effect.\nWe have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) to monitor and manage data for any non-clinical and clinical programs that we may conduct, including the OPC PMR studies discussed above. We rely on these parties for execution of our non-clinical and clinical trials, and control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies and clinical trials are conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCP and other regulations, including as a result of any recent changes in such regulations, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP requirements. While we have agreements governing the activities of our CROs, we have limited influence over their actual performance. Failure to comply with applicable regulations in the conduct of the clinical trials for our products would have an adverse impact on our commercial efforts.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Strategy\nThe announcement and pendency of our acquisition of BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOn February 14, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. (\u201cBDSI\u201d). The transaction (the \u201cAcquisition\u201d) is expected to close late in the first quarter 2022, subject to customary closing conditions. We have devoted, and will continue to devote, significant management and other internal resources towards the completion of the Acquisition and planning for integration. Completion of the Acquisition is subject to conditions beyond our control that may prevent, delay or otherwise adversely affect its completion in a material way. The failure to complete the Acquisition in a timely manner or at all could negatively impact the market price of our common stock as it currently reflects an assumption that the transaction will be completed. Furthermore, if the Acquisition is significantly delayed or not completed, we may suffer other consequences that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and stock price, including the following:\n\u25cf\nwe would have incurred significant costs in connection with the Acquisition that we may be unable to recover;\n\u25cf\nwe may be subject to negative publicity or be negatively perceived by the investment or business communities;\n\u25cf\nwe may be subject to legal proceedings related to the Acquisition;\n\u25cf\nany disruptions to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the Acquisition, including any adverse changes in our relationships with our customers, suppliers, other business partners and employees, may continue or intensify in the event the Acquisition is not consummated; and\n\u25cf\nwe may not be able to take advantage of alternative business opportunities or effectively respond to competitive pressures.\nThere can be no assurance that our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows will not be adversely affected, as compared to prior to the announcement of the Acquisition, if the Acquisition is not consummated.\nOur ability to realize the benefits from the acquisition of BDSI is substantially dependent on the cost savings resulting from the timely and effective integration of the operations of Collegium and BDSI.\nOur ability to realize the benefits from the acquisition of BDSI is substantially dependent on the cost savings resulting from the timely and effective integration of the operations Collegium and BDSI. The process of integrating the operations of Collegium and BDSI could encounter unexpected costs and delays, which include: the loss of key personnel; the loss of key customers; the loss of key suppliers; and unanticipated issues in integrating sales, marketing and administrative functions. If we are unable to timely and effectively integrate the operations of Collegium and BDSI,\nour costs could be adversely affected, and our business could suffer. Further, even if the integration is timely and effective, we may never realize the cost savings expected from the integration of the operations of our two companies.\nOur business may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has, and will likely continue to have, a substantial impact on the delivery of healthcare services in the United States. Healthcare providers have reduced staffing and limited access for non-patients, including our sales professionals. Notwithstanding the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions in many jurisdictions, and amidst continuing public health concerns relating to the spread of COVID-19, weekly pain patient office visits continue to be depressed compared to pre-COVID periods, which in turn may account for fewer patients beginning therapy with our products. We believe that the disruptions caused by COVID-19 will continue and there remains substantial uncertainty as to when such disruptions will cease. These circumstances may result in reduced demand for our products and negatively impact our sales and results of operations.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our results of operation will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, the rate and manner in which it spreads, the duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions imposed by the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruption in the United States and other countries, a reduction in time spent out of home and the actions taken throughout the world, including in our markets, to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact. Although travel and other restrictions have been lifted in certain jurisdictions, there remains substantial uncertainty as to the possibility of further surges in infections, including surges resulting from the development of new variants of COVID-19 which could lead to travel and other restrictions being re-imposed. These actions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we will continue to monitor the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic closely.\nLitigation or regulatory action regarding opioid medications could negatively affect our business.\nBeginning in 2018, lawsuits alleging damages related to opioids have been filed naming us as a defendant along with other manufacturers of prescription opioid medications. These lawsuits, filed in multiple jurisdictions, are brought by various local governments as well as private claimants, against various manufacturers, distributors and retail pharmacies. These lawsuits generally contend that we have engaged in improper marketing practices related to Xtampza ER and the Nucynta Products. Plaintiffs seek a variety of remedies, including abatement, restitution, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, treble damages, attorneys\u2019 fees and injunctive relief. Some plaintiffs have alleged joint and several liability among the defendants, meaning that any given defendant may be found liable for the activities of other defendants. None of the complaints specify the exact amount of damages at issue. These cases are generally in early stages of litigation.\nIn addition, certain governmental and regulatory agencies are focused on the abuse of opioid medications, a concern we share, and we have received Civil Investigative Demands or subpoenas from four state attorneys general investigating our sales and marketing of opioids and seeking documents relating to the manufacture, marketing and sale of opioid medications. We are cooperating fully in these investigations. Managing litigation and responding to governmental investigations is costly and may involve a significant diversion of management attention. Such proceedings are unpredictable and may develop over lengthy periods of time. An adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits or investigations may involve injunctive relief or substantial monetary penalties, either or both of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face substantial competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products more successfully than we do.\nCompetition in the pain and opioid market is intense. Our competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and universities and other research institutions. Our products compete with oral opioids, transdermal opioids, local anesthetic patches, stimulants and implantable and external infusion pumps that can be used for infusion of opioids and local anesthetics. Products of these types are marketed by Actavis, BioDelivery Sciences, Endo, Mallinckrodt, Purdue, Teva, and others. Some of these current and potential future competitors may be addressing the same therapeutic areas or indications as we are. Many of our current and potential future competitors have significantly greater research and development capabilities than we do, have substantially more marketing, manufacturing, financial, technical, human and managerial resources than we do, and have more institutional experience than we do. Our competitors have developed or may develop technologies that are, or may be, the basis for competitive products that are safer, more effective or less costly than our products. Moreover, oral medications, transdermal drug\ndelivery systems, such as drug patches, injectable products and implantable drug delivery devices are currently available treatments for chronic pain, are widely accepted in the medical community and have a long history of use. These treatments will compete with our products and the established use of these competitive products may limit the potential for our products to receive widespread acceptance.\nCommercial sales of our products, and clinical trials of our products and any future product candidates, may expose us to expensive product liability claims, and we may not be able to maintain product liability insurance on reasonable terms or at all.\nWe currently carry product liability insurance. Product liability claims may be brought against us by patients; clinical trial participants; healthcare providers; or others using, administering or selling our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our products caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may cause us to incur significant costs to defend the litigation.\nOur relationships with customers and payors are subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency, and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, exclusion from government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of our products. Our arrangements with payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products and any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval. Even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors directly, we may provide reimbursement guidance and support regarding our products to our customers and patients. Federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights are and will be applicable to our business. If a government authority were to conclude that we provided improper advice to our customers and/or encouraged the submission of false claims for reimbursement, we could face action by government authorities. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nWe or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by natural disasters and/or health epidemics, and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nNatural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. If a natural disaster, power outage, health epidemic (such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic) or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our facilities, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it might become difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business, and any disruption could last for a substantial period of time.\nThe disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place, and the technology that we may rely upon to implement such plans, may prove inadequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock is highly volatile and may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors described in these Risk Factors, some of which are beyond our control. The stock market in general, and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our\nbusiness model, prospects or actual operating performance. The realization of any of these risks, or any of a broad range of other risks discussed in this report, could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to anti-takeover provisions in our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and under Virginia law that could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders.\nCertain provisions of Virginia law, the state in which we are incorporated, and our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could hamper a third party\u2019s acquisition of us, or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of us. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. In addition, these provisions make it more difficult for our shareholders to remove our Board of Directors or management or elect new directors to our Board of Directors.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows accurately, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. We are required, under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
