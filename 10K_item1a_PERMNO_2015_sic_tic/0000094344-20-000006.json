{"cik": "94344", "company": "STEWART INFORMATION SERVICES CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information presented in this report and our other filings with the SEC, in evaluating our business and any investment in Stewart. These risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In that event, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline materially.\nAdverse changes in economic conditions, especially those affecting the levels of real estate and mortgage activity, may reduce our revenues.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are affected by changes in economic conditions, particularly mortgage interest rates, credit availability, real estate prices and consumer confidence. Our revenues and earnings have fluctuated in the past due to the cyclical nature of the housing industry and we expect them to fluctuate in the future.\nThe demand for our title insurance-related and mortgage services offerings is dependent primarily on the volume of residential and commercial real estate transactions. The volume of these transactions historically has been influenced by such factors as mortgage interest rates, availability of financing and the overall state of the economy. Typically, when interest rates are increasing or when the economy is experiencing a downturn, real estate activity declines. As a result, the title insurance industry tends to experience decreased revenues and earnings. Increases in interest rates may also have an adverse impact on our bond portfolio and the amount of interest we pay on our floating-rate bank debt.\nOur revenues and results of operations have been and may in the future be adversely affected by a decline in home prices, real estate activity and the availability of financing alternatives. In addition, weakness or adverse changes in the level of real estate activity could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nOur claims experience may require us to increase our provision for title losses or to record additional reserves, either of which would adversely affect our earnings.\nWe estimate our future loss payments, and our assumptions about future losses may prove inaccurate. Provisions for policy losses on policies written within a given year are charged to income in the same year the related premium revenues are recognized. The amounts provided are based on reported claims, historical loss payment experience, title industry averages and the current legal and economic environment. Losses that are higher than anticipated are an indication that total losses for a given policy year may be higher than originally calculated. Changes in the total estimated future loss for prior policy years are recorded in the period in which the estimate changes. Claims are often complex and involve uncertainties as to the dollar amount and timing of individual payments. Claims are often paid many years after a policy is issued. From time-to-time, we experience large losses, including losses from independent agency defalcations, from title policies that have been issued or worsening loss payment experience, any of which may require us to increase our title loss reserves. These events are unpredictable and may have a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nCompetition in the title insurance industry may affect our revenues.\nCompetition in the title insurance industry is intense, particularly with respect to price, service and expertise. Larger commercial customers and mortgage originators also look to the size and financial strength of a title insurer. Although we are one of the leading title insurance underwriters based on market share, FNF, First American and Old Republic each has substantially greater revenues than we do and their holding companies have significantly greater capital. Further, the other title insurance companies, collectively, hold a considerable share of the market. Although we are not aware of any current initiatives to reduce regulatory barriers to entering our industry, any such reduction could result in new competitors, including financial institutions, entering the title insurance business. From time-to-time, new entrants enter the marketplace with alternative products to traditional title insurance, although many of these alternative products have been disallowed by title insurance regulators. Further, advances in technologies could, over time, significantly disrupt the traditional business model of financial services and real estate-related companies, including title insurance. These alternative products or disruptive technologies, if permitted by regulators, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings.\nAvailability of credit may reduce our liquidity and negatively impact our ability to fund operations.\nWe expect that cash flows from operations and cash available from our underwriters, subject to regulatory restrictions, will be sufficient to fund our operations, pay our claims and fund operational initiatives. To the extent that these funds are not sufficient, we may be required to borrow funds on less than favorable terms or seek funding from the equity market, which may be on terms that are dilutive to existing shareholders.\nA downgrade of our underwriters by rating agencies may reduce our revenues.\nRatings are a significant component in determining the competitiveness of insurance companies with respect to commercial title policies. Our domestic underwriters, Guaranty and STIC, have historically been highly rated by the rating agencies that cover us. These ratings are not credit ratings. Instead, the ratings are based on quantitative, and in some cases qualitative, information and reflect the conclusions of the rating agencies with respect to our financial strength, results of operations and ability to pay policyholder claims. Our ratings are subject to continual review by the rating agencies, and we cannot be assured that our current ratings will be maintained. If our ratings are downgraded from current levels by the rating agencies, our ability to retain existing customers and develop new customer relationships may be negatively impacted, which could result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nOur insurance subsidiaries must comply with extensive government regulations. These regulations could adversely affect our ability to increase our revenues and operating results.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is charged with protecting consumers by enforcing federal consumer protection laws and regulations. The CFPB is an independent agency and funded by the United States Federal Reserve System. Its jurisdiction includes banks, credit unions, securities firms, payday lenders, mortgage servicing operations, foreclosure relief services, debt collectors and other financial companies. The nature and extent of these regulations include, but are not limited to: conducting rule-making, supervision, and enforcement of federal consumer protection laws; restricting unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices; marshalling consumer complaints; promoting financial education; researching consumer behavior; monitoring financial markets for new risks to consumers; and enforcing laws that outlaw discrimination and other unfair treatment in consumer finance.\nGovernmental authorities regulate our insurance subsidiaries in the various states and international jurisdictions in which we do business. These regulations generally are intended for the protection of policyholders rather than stockholders. The nature and extent of these regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but typically involve:\n\u2022\napproving or setting of insurance premium rates;\n\u2022\nstandards of solvency and minimum amounts of statutory capital and surplus that must be maintained;\n\u2022\nlimitations on types and amounts of investments;\n\u2022\nestablishing reserves, including statutory premium reserves, for losses and loss adjustment expenses;\n\u2022\nregulating underwriting and marketing practices;\n\u2022\nregulating dividend payments and other transactions among affiliates;\n\u2022\nprior approval for the acquisition and control of an insurance company or of any company controlling an insurance company;\n\u2022\nlicensing of insurers, agencies and, in certain states, escrow officers;\n\u2022\nregulation of reinsurance;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the size of risks that may be insured by a single company;\n\u2022\ndeposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders;\n\u2022\napproval of policy forms;\n\u2022\nmethods of accounting; and\n\u2022\nfiling of annual and other reports with respect to financial condition and other matters.\nThese regulations may impede or impose burdensome conditions on rate increases or other actions that we might want to take to enhance our operating results.\nWe may also be subject to additional state or federal regulations prescribed by legislation such as the Dodd-Frank Act or by regulations issued by the CFPB, Department of Labor, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Department of the Treasury or other agencies. Changes in regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, state regulators perform periodic examinations of insurance companies, which could result in increased compliance or legal expenses.\nRapid changes in our industry require secure, timely and cost-effective technological responses. Our earnings may be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively use technology to address regulatory changes and increase productivity.\nWe believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate changes in the industry and to offer products and services that meet evolving standards on a timely and cost-effective basis. To do so requires a flexible technology architecture which can continuously comply with changing regulations, improve productivity, lower costs, reduce risk and enhance the customer experience. Inability to meet these requirements and any unanticipated downtime in our technology may have a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nWe rely on dividends from our insurance underwriting subsidiaries.\nWe are a holding company and our principal assets are our insurance underwriting subsidiaries. Consequently, we depend on receiving sufficient dividends from our insurance subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations and to pay our parent company's operating expenses and dividends to our stockholders. The insurance statutes and regulations of some states require us to maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital and restrict the amount of dividends that our insurance subsidiaries may pay to us. Guaranty is a wholly owned subsidiary of Stewart and the principal source of our cash flow. In this regard, the ability of Guaranty to pay dividends to us is dependent on the approval of the Texas Insurance Commissioner. Refer to Note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements for details on statutory surplus and dividend restrictions.\nClaims by large classes of claimants may impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are involved in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, we may be, and have been in the past, subject to claims and litigation from large classes of claimants seeking substantial damages not arising in the ordinary course of business. Material pending legal proceedings not in the ordinary course of business, if any, would be disclosed in Part I, Item 3 - Legal Proceedings. To date, the impact of the outcome of these proceedings has not been material to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. However, an unfavorable outcome in any litigation, claim or investigation against us could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nInformation technology systems present potential targets for cyber security attacks.\nOur operations are reliant on technology. These systems are used to store and process sensitive information regarding our operations, financial position and any information pertaining to our customers and vendors. While we take the utmost precautions, we cannot guarantee safety from all cyber threats, wire fraud and attacks to our systems. Any successful breach of security could result in the spread of inaccurate or confidential information, disruption of operations, theft of escrowed funds, endangerment of employees, damage to our assets and increased costs to respond. Although we maintain cyber liability insurance to protect us financially, there is no assurance that the instances noted above would not have a negative impact on cash flows, litigation status and/or our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnfavorable economic or other business conditions could cause us to record an impairment of all or a portion of our goodwill, other intangible assets and other long-lived assets.\nWe annually perform impairment tests of the carrying values of our goodwill, other indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets. We may also perform an evaluation whenever events may indicate an impairment has occurred. In assessing whether an impairment has occurred, we consider whether the performance of our reporting units may be below projections, unexpected declines in our market capitalization, negative macroeconomic trends or negative industry and company-specific trends. If we conclude that the carrying values of these assets exceed the fair value, we may be required to record an impairment of these assets. Any substantial impairment that may be required in the future could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. During 2019, we recorded impairment charges on our title plants, buildings, intangible assets, equity-method investments and other assets primarily related to corporate organizational initiatives that we started during the fourth quarter 2019. Refer to Notes 1-K, 6 and 8 to our audited consolidated financial statements for details.\nFailures at financial institutions at which we deposit funds could adversely affect us.\nWe deposit substantial fiduciary funds, which are third-party funds, and operating funds in many financial institutions in excess of insured deposit limits. In the event that one or more of these financial institutions fail, there is no guarantee that we could recover the deposited funds in excess of federal deposit insurance, and, as such, we could be held liable for the funds owned by third parties. Under these circumstances, our liability could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur investment portfolio is subject to interest rate and other risks and could experience losses.\nWe maintain a substantial investment portfolio, primarily consisting of fixed income debt securities and, to a lesser extent, equity securities. Our portfolio holdings are subject to certain economic and financial market risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. Instability in credit markets and economic conditions can increase the risk of loss in our portfolio. Periodically, we assess the recoverability of the amortized cost of our debt securities investments. If the amortized cost of such investments exceeds the fair value, and we conclude the decline is other-than-temporary, we are required to record an impairment. The impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur business could be disrupted as a result of a threatened proxy contest and other actions of activist stockholders.\nWe have previously been the subject of actions taken by activist stockholders. When activist activities occur, our business could be adversely affected because we may have difficulty in attracting and retaining customers, agents, mortgage lenders, servicers, employees and board members due to perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and negative public statements about our business; such activities may materially harm our relationships with current and potential customers, investors, lenders, and others; may otherwise materially harm our business, may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition; responding to proxy contests and other similar actions by stockholders is likely to result in our incurring substantial additional costs, including, but not limited to, legal fees, fees for financial advisors, fees for investor relations advisors, and proxy solicitation fees; significantly divert the attention of management, our Board of Directors and our employees; and changes in the composition of our Board of Directors due to activist campaigns may affect our current strategic plan.\nWe cannot predict, and no assurances can be given as to, the outcome or timing of any matters relating to actions by activist stockholders or the ultimate impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 72980, "SIC": 6361, "TIC": "STC"}
