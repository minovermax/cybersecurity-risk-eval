Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business\nGeneral business and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur businesses and operations are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States. If the U.S. economy is unable to steadily and continuously emerge from the recession that began in 2007 our growth and profitability could be constrained. In addition, economic conditions in foreign countries can affect the stability of global financial markets, which could hinder the U.S. economic recovery. Financial markets remain concerned about the ability of certain European countries to finance and service their debt and about recent currency devaluations and inflation in certain emerging markets. The default by any one of these countries on their debt payments and deteriorating conditions in other countries could lead to weaker economic conditions in the United States. Weak economic conditions are characterized by deflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, including a lack of liquidity and/or depressed prices in the secondary market for mortgage loans, increased delinquencies on mortgage, consumer and commercial loans, residential and commercial real estate price declines and lower home sales and commercial activity. All of these factors are detrimental to our business. Our business is significantly affected by monetary and related policies of the U.S. federal government, its agencies and government-sponsored entities, or GSEs. Changes in any of these policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. Actions by the FHLB, or the FRB, may reduce our borrowing capacity. Additionally, we may not be able to attract deposits at competitive rates. An inability to raise funds through traditional deposits, brokered deposits, borrowings, the sale of securities or loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity or result in increased funding costs. Furthermore, we invest in several asset classes, including significant investments in MSR, which may be less liquid in certain markets. Liquidity may also be adversely impacted by bank supervisory and regulatory authorities mandating changes in the composition of our balance sheet to asset classes that are less liquid.\nOur access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory action against us. In addition, our access to deposits may be affected by the liquidity and/or cash flow needs of depositors. Although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and FHLB advances as necessary, we might not be able to replace such funds in the future and can lose a relatively inexpensive source of funds and increase our funding costs if, among other things, clients move funds out of bank deposits and into alternative investments, such as the stock market, that are perceived as providing superior expected returns. Furthermore, an inability to increase our deposit base at all or at attractive rates would impede our ability to fund our continued growth, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to raise funds through deposits or borrowings could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\nAlthough we consider our sources of funds adequate for our liquidity needs, we may be compelled to seek additional sources of financing in the future. We may be required to seek additional regulatory capital through capital raising at terms that may be very dilutive to existing common stockholders. Likewise, we may need to incur additional debt in the future to achieve our business objectives, in connection with future acquisitions or for other reasons. Any borrowings, if sought, may not be available to us or, if available, may not be on favorable terms.\nOur financial results are significantly affected in a number of ways by changes in interest rates, which may make our results volatile from quarter to quarter.\nMost of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature, which subjects us to significant risks from changes in interest rates and can impact our net income and the valuation of our assets and liabilities. Our operating results depend to a great extent on our net interest margin, which is the difference between the amount of interest income we earn and the amount of interest expense we incur. If the rate of interest we pay on our interest-bearing deposits, borrowings and other liabilities increases more than the rate of interest we receive on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets, our net interest income, and therefore our earnings, would be adversely affected. Our earnings also could be\nadversely affected if the rates on our loans and other investments fall more quickly than those on our deposits, borrowings and other liabilities. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including competition, general economic conditions and monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities, including the FRB. A strengthening U.S. economy could cause the FRB to increase short-term interest rates, which would increase our borrowing costs and may reduce our profit margins. A sustained low interest rate environment could cause many of our loans subject to adjustable rates to reprice downward to lower interest rates, which would decrease our loan yields and reduce our profit margins. Alternatively, mortgage origination volume and revenues usually decline during periods of rising or high interest rates and increase during periods of declining or low interest rates.\nChanges in interest rates also have a significant impact on the carrying value of a significant percentage of the assets on our balance sheet. Our MSR are valued based on a number of factors, including assumptions about borrower repayment rates, which are heavily influenced by prevailing interest rates. When interest rates fall, borrowers are usually more likely to prepay their mortgage loans by refinancing them at a lower rate. As the likelihood of prepayment increases, the fair value of our MSR can decrease, which, in turn, may reduce earnings in the period in which the decrease occurs.\nIn addition, mortgage loans held for sale for which an active secondary market and readily available market prices exist and other interests we hold related to residential loan sales and securitizations are carried at fair value. The value of these assets may be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. We may not correctly or adequately hedge this risk, and even if we do hedge the risk with derivatives and other instruments, we may still incur significant losses from changes in the value of these assets or from changes in the value of the hedging instruments.\nEven though originating mortgage loans, which benefit from declining rates, and servicing mortgage loans, which benefit from rising rates, can act as a \u201cnatural hedge\u201d to soften the overall impact of changes in rates on our consolidated financial results, the hedge is not perfect, either in amount or timing. For example, the negative effect on revenue from a decrease in the fair value of residential MSR is generally immediate, but any offsetting revenue benefit from more originations and the MSR relating to the new loans would generally accrue over time.\nWe enter into forward starting swaps as a hedging strategy related to our expected future issuances of debt. This hedging strategy allows us to fix the interest rate margin between our interest earning assets and our interest bearing liabilities. A continued prolonged period of lower interest rates could affect the duration of our interest earning assets and adversely impact our operations in future periods.\nWe may be required to make further increases in our provisions for loan and lease losses and to charge-off additional loans and leases in the future, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nDespite historically low interest rates and a recovering real estate market, other weak economic data and global concerns remain. We maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL), which is a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease loss expense that represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s judgment with respect to:\n\u2022\ncontinuing evaluation of specific credit risks;\n\u2022\nloan loss experience;\n\u2022\ncurrent loan and lease portfolio quality;\n\u2022\npresent economic, political and regulatory conditions;\n\u2022\nindustry concentrations; and\n\u2022\nother unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio.\nThe determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses.\nIn addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. Any adjustments made to the ALLL resulting from regulatory review must be an adjustment to the ALLL in accordance with GAAP. If charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan and lease losses, we may need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan and lease losses, which would result in a decrease in net income and capital, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have undertaken certain actions to reposition our business in recent periods and these actions may be unsuccessful or may not fully achieve the results that we have intended.\nIn 2013, we exited our wholesale lending business. In addition, during 2013 we also consolidated all of our commercial lending activities under a realigned leadership team based on our belief that this sales and reporting structure will help to drive efficiency and enhance our focus on cross-sell opportunities in markets where we have strong residential lending and deposit clients.\nDuring the first quarter 2014, we completed the sale of our default servicing operations and the rights to service and subservice some of our MSR to Green Tree Servicing LLC, a subsidiary of Walter Investment Management Corp. We believe this sale, along with our wholesale broker lending exit, enhanced the efficiency of our mortgage banking business and realigned our mortgage banking focus on our core preferred jumbo offering.\nThe success of these repositioning activities will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from disposing of and centralizing the operation of these businesses. However, to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings, we must successfully execute the transactions as planned and reduce related expenses and salary costs on the expected timeline which may not be possible because of evolving market and regulatory conditions and delays in obtaining, or the inability to obtain, required regulatory approvals. If we are not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the repositioning activities may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.\nMortgage loan modification and refinancing programs and future legislative action may adversely affect the value of, and our returns on, residential mortgage-backed securities and on MSR.\nLoan modification programs, future legislative or regulatory actions, including possible amendments to the bankruptcy laws, which result in the modification of outstanding residential mortgage loans, as well as changes in the requirements necessary to qualify for refinancing mortgage loans with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae, may adversely affect the value of, and the returns on, our portfolio of mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and on the value of our MSR. Our MSR is valued based on a number of factors, including assumptions about borrower repayment rates and costs of servicing. If the interest rate on a mortgage is adjusted, or if a borrower is permitted to refinance at a lower rate, or the costs of servicing or costs of foreclosures increase, the value of our MSR with respect to that mortgage can decrease, which, in turn, may reduce earnings in the period in which the decrease occurs. In addition, increases in servicing costs from changes to our foreclosure and other servicing practices, including resulting from the consent orders, adversely affects the fair value of our MSR.\nOur gain on sale of loans could decrease in future periods if refinancing activity declines.\nIn prior periods we have seen elevated residential mortgage refinancing activity due to historically low interest rates as well as due to government programs such as Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) and Home Affordable Refinancing Program (HARP). During 2013, we experienced heightened demand for mortgage loans by investors in the secondary market as a result of historically low interest rates and favorable risk adjusted yield on mortgage assets relative to other investments. This expanded secondary market activity has resulted in attractive resale opportunities which have resulted in elevated gain on sale of loans income during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nMore recently the FRB has indicated that it would phase out quantitative easing and has indicated a rate hike is possible in mid-2015. In a rising interest rate environment, we would expect that refinancing volumes would continue to decline, which could cause our originations of mortgage loans held for sale to decrease along with our gain on sale of loans.\nThe returns on our government insured mortgage pool buyouts could decrease as a result of changes in foreclosure timelines and costs.\nWe have a history of servicing Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans. As a servicer, the buyout opportunity is the right to purchase above market rate, government insured loans at par (i.e., the amount that has to be passed through to the Ginnie Mae (GNMA) security holder when repurchased). Each loan in a GNMA pool is insured or guaranteed by one of several federal government agencies, including the Federal Housing Administration, Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs or the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Rural Housing Service. The loans must at all times comply with the requirements for maintaining such insurance or guarantee.\nWe expect loans that go through the foreclosure process will be settled generally within one to two years depending on the state\u2019s foreclosure timelines. Changes to foreclosure regulations, bankruptcy proceedings, loss mitigation requirements and our inability to timely process foreclosures could extend the duration that these loans are held on our balance sheet. To the extent these risks extend the duration, our foreclosure costs and net interest margin could be negatively impacted. Operational capacity poses a risk to the claim through missed servicing milestones. Servicing operations must comply with the government agencies' servicing requirements in order to avoid interest curtailments (principal is not at risk).\nOur commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolio exposes us to risks that may be greater than the risks related to our other mortgage loans.\nAt December 31, 2014, our commercial real estate loans, net of discounts, were $3.5 billion, or approximately 20% of our total loan portfolio, net of allowances. Commercial real estate loans generally carry larger loan balances and involve a greater degree of financial and credit risk than residential mortgage loans or home equity loans. The repayment of these loans is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate or commercial projects. If the cash flow from the project is reduced, a borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Furthermore, the repayment of commercial mortgage loans is generally less predictable and more difficult to evaluate and monitor and collateral may be more difficult to dispose of in a market decline. In such cases, we may be compelled to modify the terms of the loan or engage in other potentially expensive work-out techniques. Any significant failure to pay on time by our borrowers would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur mortgage warehouse finance portfolio totaled $1.4 billion, or 8% of our total loan portfolio, net of allowances. These lines of credit represent large, short-term, revolving facilities to financial services companies, typically mortgage banking companies, with a total commitment amount of $2.3 billion extended to 35 borrowers at December 31, 2014. These financial services companies utilize their lines of credit to fund transactions, which are primarily collateralized by agency and government residential loans originated by our clients. The repayment of outstandings on these lines is typically dependent upon the sale of those loans originated by our clients utilizing their lines of credit into the secondary market. In the event loans originated by these borrowers cannot be sold on the secondary market, our ability to achieve repayment may be negatively affected. Due to this risk and the size of the exposure to any one borrower, the failure of one borrower could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is concentrated in California and Florida and events or circumstances which adversely affect the economies or real estate values in those states could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately 26% and 9% of our residential loan portfolio was secured by real estate located in California and Florida, respectively, and 13% and 14% of our commercial and commercial real estate portfolios were secured by businesses and real estate located in California and Florida, respectively. Our loan concentration in these states subjects us to risk that a downturn in the local economy in either California or Florida could result in increases in delinquencies and foreclosures or losses on these loans. In addition, the occurrence of natural disasters in California or Florida, such as earthquakes or hurricanes, or man-made disasters, could result in a decline in the value or destruction of our mortgaged properties and an increase in the risk of delinquencies or foreclosures. The occurrence of any one of these factors could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may become subject to additional risks as a result of the growth of our commercial lending business.\nOur expansion into commercial lending could expose us to new markets where we have little commercial experience, which could result in losses that would affect our financial results. Historically we have originated commercial loans mostly in Florida, however over the past several years, we have developed a platform to generate commercial loans across the country. If we do not maintain strong underwriting standards as we have in the past, we may suffer losses if these loans fail to perform.\nConditions in the residential real estate market and higher than normal delinquency and default rates could adversely affect our business.\nThe origination and servicing of residential mortgages is a significant component of our business and our earnings may be adversely affected if real estate markets weaken and delinquency and default rates increase. If the frequency and severity of our loan delinquencies and default rates increase, we could experience losses on loans held for investment and on newly originated or purchased loans that we hold for sale. We may need to further increase our reserves for foreclosures if foreclosure rates increase.\nA deteriorating real estate market and higher than normal delinquency and default rates on loans have other adverse consequences for our mortgage banking business, including:\n\u2022\ncash flows and capital resources are reduced, as we are required to make cash advances to meet contractual obligations to investors, process foreclosures, maintain, repair and market foreclosed properties;\n\u2022\nmortgage service fee revenues decline because we recognize these revenues only upon collection;\n\u2022\nnet interest income may decline and interest expense may increase due to lower average cash and capital balances and higher capital funding requirements;\n\u2022\nmortgage and loan servicing costs rise;\n\u2022\nan inability to sell our MSR in the capital markets due to reduced liquidity;\n\u2022\namortization and impairment charges on our MSR increase; and\n\u2022\nrealized and unrealized losses on and declines in the liquidity of securities held in our investment portfolio that are collateralized by mortgage obligations.\nWe may be required to repurchase mortgage loans with identified defects, indemnify the investor or guarantor, or reimburse the investor for credit loss incurred on the loan in the event of a material breach of representations or warranties.\nWe may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or reimburse investors as a result of breaches in contractual representations and warranties from our sales of loans we originate and servicing of loans originated by other parties. We conduct these activities under contractual provisions that include various representations and warranties, which typically cover ownership of the loan, compliance with loan criteria set forth in the applicable agreement, validity of the lien securing the loan and similar matters. We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans with identified defects, indemnify the investor or guarantor, or reimburse the investor for credit loss incurred on the loan in the event of a material breach of such contractual representations or warranties.\nWe experienced increased levels of repurchase demands beginning in 2010, which has led to material increases in our loan repurchase reserves relative to historical levels. We may need to increase such reserves in the future, which would adversely affect net income. As of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, our loan repurchase reserve for loans that we sold or securitized was $25.9 million, $20.2 million and $27.0 million, respectively, representing a 28% increase during 2014 and a 25% decrease during 2013.\nIn addition, we also service residential mortgage loans where a GSE is the owner of the underlying mortgage loan asset. Prior to late 2009, we had not historically experienced a significant amount of repurchases related to the servicing of mortgage loans as we were indemnified by the seller of the servicing rights, but due to the failures of several of our counterparties, we have since experienced losses related to the repurchase of loans from GSEs and subsequent disposal or payment demands from the GSEs. As of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, our reserve for servicing repurchase losses was $2.9 million, $23.7 million and $26.0 million, respectively, representing an 88% decrease during 2014 and a 9% decrease during 2013.\nMoreover, increased enforcement activity related to FHA-insured loans may present risk to us under the federal False Claims Act and other similar federal laws. While the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) may use its authority to seek civil money penalties, request indemnification of FHA insurance claims, and impose other penalties related to origination and servicing deficiencies in FHA loans, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has recently entered into several major agreements with FHA lenders to settle allegations of false claims in connection with the underwriting of FHA-insured loans and compliance with other FHA program requirements. These settlement agreements have resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in settlement payments to the United States and HUD, as well as dedicated funds to be used for borrower assistance. As the False Claims Act permits the federal government to recover treble damages for claims based on false certifications, the potential liability for an FHA lender submitting insurance claims on the loans it originates could be significant.\nIf future repurchase demands remain at heightened levels or further increase, the severity of the repurchase requests increase, our success at appealing repurchase or other requests differs from past experience, or we are faced with increased FHA enforcement, we may need to increase our loan repurchase reserves, and increased repurchase obligations could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. For additional information, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Loans Subject to Representations and Warranties.\u201d\nWe entered into subservicing agreements, and in the event that counterparty fails to abide by the agreements, we may be forced to service the loans or find another subservicer, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the subservicer fails to comply with applicable servicing guidelines or is unable to abide by the terms of the subservicing agreements, we would be obligated to service the loans. If we were required to service these loans, we would incur substantial cost in building the infrastructure to service the loans. Alternatively we could find another party to subservice the loans, which could take time selecting and transferring the servicing to said party. As a result of the time involved in either our taking over the servicing of the loans or in locating a servicer to do so, we may be delayed in receiving or making payments as required, which could result in lost interest payments and unrecoverable advances of fees on the loans. As a result our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe own government insured loans which are serviced by third parties, and in the event those third parties fail to service the loans in accordance with applicable servicing guidelines, we may not be able to recover the full value of the interest payments and fees on the loans which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain loans we own are serviced by third parties. Generally when a loan is in default the servicer continues to make advances, and once the loan is foreclosed upon, the government entities insuring the loan will remit the principal, the guaranteed interest and the advanced fees to the loan owner. However, if the loan is in default and the servicer has not been abiding by the servicing guidelines, the government entities will\nremit to the loan owner the principal for the loan, but may not pay to the loan owner the full guaranteed interest or advanced fees during the time from when the servicer failed on its obligations up to and through the foreclosure on the loan. As a result, we as the loan owner will not suffer any loss of principal, but we could be required to advance the fees on the loans, without receiving payment from the government entities for those fees, and be curtailed for a portion or all of the guaranteed interest. While we would have a cause of action against the third party servicer, in the event that said third party was insolvent or unable to pay, then we would suffer these losses without recourse. As a result our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur concentration of mass-affluent clients and \u201cjumbo\u201d mortgages in our residential mortgage portfolio makes us particularly vulnerable to a downturn in high-end real estate values and economic factors disproportionately affecting affluent consumers of financial services.\nThe FHA, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will only purchase or guarantee so-called \u201cconforming\u201d loans, which may not exceed certain principal amount thresholds. As of December 31, 2014, a majority of our residential mortgage loans held for investment that are not government insured was comprised of \u201cjumbo\u201d loans based on the current threshold of $417,000 in most states, and 87% of the carrying value of our securities portfolio was comprised of residential nonagency investment securities, substantially all of which are backed by jumbo loans. Jumbo loans have principal balances exceeding the thresholds of the agencies described above, and tend to be less liquid than conforming loans, which may make it more difficult for us to rapidly rebalance our portfolio and risk profile than is the case for financial institutions with higher concentrations of conforming loan assets. In addition real estate securing jumbo loans tends to be concentrated in certain limited markets and real estate prices in those markets have historically been more volatile that in the median price range markets, which affects the default rates of these mortgages and the marketability of jumbo mortgages to investors. As a result, liquidity in the capital markets for such assets could be diminished and we could be faced with an inability to dispose of such assets or fully recover our losses in the event of a default.\nHedging strategies that we use to manage our mortgage pipeline may be ineffective to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates.\nWe typically use derivatives and other instruments to hedge a portion of our mortgage banking interest rate risk. Hedging is a complex process, requiring sophisticated models and constant monitoring, and is not a perfect science. We may use hedging instruments tied to U.S. Treasury rates, London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or Eurodollars that may not perfectly correlate with the value or income being hedged. Our mortgage pipeline consists of our commitments to purchase mortgage loans, or interest rate locks, and funded mortgage loans that will be sold in the secondary market. The risk associated with the mortgage pipeline is that interest rates will fluctuate between the time we commit to purchase a loan at a pre-determined price, or the client locks in the interest rate on a loan, and the time we sell or commit to sell the mortgage loan. Generally speaking, if interest rates increase, the value of an unhedged mortgage pipeline decreases, and gain on sale margins are adversely impacted. Typically, we economically hedge the risk of overall changes in fair value of loans held for sale by either entering into forward loan sale agreements, selling forward Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac MBS or using other derivative instruments to economically hedge loan commitments and to create fair value hedges against the funded loan portfolios. We generally do not hedge all of the interest rate risk on our mortgage portfolio and have not historically hedged the risk of changes in the fair value of our MSR resulting from changes in interest rates. To the extent we fail to appropriately reduce our exposure to interest rate changes, our financial results may be adversely affected.\nWe could recognize realized and unrealized losses on securities held in our securities portfolio, particularly if economic and market conditions deteriorate.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the fair value of our securities portfolio was approximately $0.9 billion, of which approximately 87% was comprised of residential nonagency investment securities. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults by the issuer or individual mortgagors with respect to the underlying securities, changes in market interest rates and continued instability in the credit markets. Any of these factors could cause an other-than-temporary impairment in future periods and result in realized losses. The process for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary usually requires difficult, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers and the performance of the underlying collateral, we may recognize realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience higher delinquencies on our equipment leases and reductions in the resale value of leased equipment.\nThe realization of equipment values (i.e., residual values) during the life and at the end of the term of a lease is an important element of our commercial finance business. At the inception of each lease, we record a residual value for the leased equipment based on our estimate of the future value of the equipment at the expected disposition date. A decrease in the market value of leased equipment at a rate greater than the rate we projected, whether due to rapid technological or economic obsolescence, unusual or excessive wear-and-tear on the equipment, recession or other adverse economic conditions, or other factors, would adversely affect the current or the residual values of such equipment. Further, certain equipment residual values are dependent on the manufacturer\u2019s or vendor\u2019s warranties, reputation and other factors, including market liquidity. In addition, we may not realize the full market value of equipment if we are required to sell it to meet liquidity needs or for other reasons outside of the ordinary course of business. Consequently, we may not realize our estimated residual values for equipment. If we are unable to realize the expected value of a substantial portion of the equipment under lease, our business could be adversely affected.\nFluctuations in national, regional and local economic conditions may increase the level of charge-offs that we make to our lease portfolio, and, consequently, reduce our net income. We are not protected for all losses and any charge-off or related losses that we experience will negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe may become subject to a number of risks if we elect to pursue acquisitions and may not be able to acquire and integrate acquisition targets successfully if we choose to do so.\nAs we have done in the past, we may pursue acquisitions as part of our growth strategy. We may consider acquisitions of loans or securities portfolios, lending or leasing firms, commercial and small business lenders, residential lenders, direct banks, banks or bank branches, wealth and investment management firms, securities brokerage firms, specialty finance or other financial services-related companies. We expect that competition for suitable acquisition targets may be significant. Additionally, we must generally receive federal regulatory approval before we can acquire an institution or business. Such regulatory approval may be denied or, if granted, could be subject to conditions that materially affect the terms of the acquisition or our ability to capture some of the opportunities presented by the acquisition. We may not be able to successfully identify and acquire suitable acquisition targets on terms and conditions we consider to be acceptable.\nEven if suitable candidates are identified and we succeed in consummating these transactions, acquisitions involve risks that may adversely affect our market value and profitability. These risks include, among other things: credit risk associated with acquired loans and investments; retaining, attracting and integrating personnel; loss of clients; reputational risks; difficulties in integrating or operating acquired businesses or assets; and potential disruption of our ongoing business operations and diversion of management\u2019s attention. Through our acquisitions we may also assume unknown or undisclosed liabilities, fail to properly assess known contingent liabilities or assume businesses with internal control deficiencies. While in most of our transactions we seek to mitigate these risks through, among other things, adequate due diligence and indemnification provisions, we cannot be certain that the due diligence we have conducted is adequate or that the indemnification provisions and other risk mitigants we put in place will be sufficient.\nCertain of our stockholders have director nomination rights through which they may influence the actions taken by us, and their interests may not align with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders.\nPursuant to an agreement between us and Sageview Partners L.P., (Sageview), Sageview has the right to designate a representative to be included in management\u2019s slate of nominees recommended to stockholders of the Company for election as a member of our Board of Directors and has the right to appoint an observer who is permitted to attend meetings of our Board of Directors. In addition pursuant to an agreement between us and Lovett Miller Venture Fund II, Limited Partnership and Lovett Miller Venture Fund III, Limited Partnership, or together, Lovett Miller, Lovett Miller has the right to appoint an observer who is permitted to attend meetings of our Board of Directors.\nThese director nomination rights and observer rights will generally survive for each of Sageview and Lovett Miller, respectively, so long as such stockholder continues to own a specified percentage of the Company\u2019s common stock. As of December 31, 2014, Lovett Miller owns 849,307 shares of our common stock, or 0.69%, and Sageview owns 12,912,230 shares of our common stock, or 10.44%. As a result of their significant holdings of our common stock, and, in the case of Sageview, its right to designate members of our Board of Directors, these stockholders are expected to be able to continue to exert significant influence over our policies and management, potentially in a manner which may not be in our other stockholders\u2019 best interests.\nWe may issue a new series of preferred stock or debt securities, which would be senior to our common stock and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe have issued one series of preferred stock, the Series A Preferred Stock. In the future, we may increase our capital resources by making additional offerings of debt or equity securities, which may include senior or subordinated notes, classes of preferred shares and/or common shares. Holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution. Preferred shares and debt, if issued, have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend or interest payments that could limit our ability to make a distribution to the holders of our common stock. Future issuances and sales of parity preferred stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales could occur, may also cause prevailing market prices for the Series A Preferred Stock and our common stock to decline and may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital in the financial markets at times and prices favorable to us. Further issuances of our common stock could be dilutive to holders of our common stock.\nOur ability to rely on brokered deposits as a part of our funding strategy may be limited.\nDeposits raised by EverBank continue to be a key part of our funding strategy. Our ability to maintain our current level of deposits or grow our deposit base could be affected by regulatory restrictions, including the possible imposition of prior approval requirements or restrictions on deposit growth through brokered channels, or restrictions on our rates offered. In addition, as a supervisory matter, reliance on brokered deposits as a significant source of funding is discouraged. As a result, in order to grow our deposit base, we will need to expand our non-brokered channels for deposit generation, including through new marketing and advertising efforts, which may require significant time, capital and effort to implement. Further, we are likely to face significant competition for deposits from other banking organizations that are also seeking stable deposits to support their funding needs. If EverBank is unable to develop new channels of deposit origination, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with our Internet-based systems and online commerce security, including \u201chacking\u201d and \u201cidentity theft.\u201d\nWe operate primarily as an online bank with a small number of financial center locations and, as such, we conduct a substantial portion of our business over the Internet. We rely heavily upon data processing, including loan servicing and deposit processing, software, communications and information systems from a number of third parties to conduct our business.\nThird party or internal systems and networks may fail to operate properly or become disabled due to deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Our operations are vulnerable to disruptions from human error, natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, spam attacks, denial of service attacks, unauthorized access and other unforeseen events. Undiscovered data corruption could render our client information inaccurate. These events may obstruct our ability to provide services and process transactions. While we believe that we are in compliance with all applicable privacy and data security laws, an incident could put our client confidential information at risk.\nAlthough we have not experienced a cyber incident which has been successful in compromising our data or systems, we can never be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to breaches of security or other technological difficulties or failures. We monitor and modify, as necessary, our protective measures in response to the perpetual evolution of cyber threats.\nA breach in the security of any of our information systems, or other cyber incident, could have an adverse impact on, among other things, our revenue, ability to attract and maintain clients and business reputation. In addition, as a result of any breach, we could incur higher costs to conduct our business, to increase protection, or related to remediation. Furthermore our clients could blame us and terminate their account with us for a cyber incident which occurred on their own system or with that of an unrelated third party. In addition, a security breach could also subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability.\nOur business may be impaired if a third party infringes on our intellectual property rights.\nOur business depends heavily upon intellectual property that we have developed and will develop in the future. Monitoring infringement of intellectual property rights is difficult, and the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property. In the past, we have had to engage in enforcement actions to protect our trademarks and copyrights from infringement and our domain names from theft, including administrative proceedings. We may in the future be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring trademark registrations or domain names that infringe or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other intellectual property rights. Intellectual property theft on\nthe Internet is relatively widespread, and individuals anywhere in the world can \u201cscrape\u201d our content or purchase infringing domains or use our service marks on their pay-per-click sites to draw clients for competitors while exploiting our service marks, or worse, engage in \u201cphishing\u201d to lure our clients into providing personal information. To the extent that we are unable to rapidly locate and stop an infringement, our intellectual property assets may become devalued and our brand may be tarnished. Third parties may also challenge, invalidate or circumvent our intellectual property rights and protections, registrations and licenses. Intellectual property litigation is expensive, and the outcome of an action could negatively impact our business, brand and profitability.\nWe may become involved in intellectual property or other disputes that could harm our business.\nThird parties may assert claims against us, asserting that our marks, services, associated content in any medium, or software applications infringe their intellectual property rights. The laws and regulations governing intellectual property rights are continually evolving and subject to differing interpretations. Trademark owners often engage in litigation in state or federal courts or oppositions in the United States Patent and Trademark Office as a strategy to broaden the scope of their trademark rights. Patent owners, particularly non-practicing entities, often pursue enforcement of broad patents that can be construed to embrace aspects of EverBank services or operations. If any infringement claim is successful against us, we may be required to pay substantial damages or we may need to seek to obtain a license of the other party\u2019s intellectual property rights. We also could lose the expected future benefit of our marketing and advertising spending or software development costs. Moreover, we may be prohibited from providing our services or using content that incorporates the challenged intellectual property.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, custody, counterparty or other relationships. At various times, we may have significant exposure to a relatively small group of counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. Losses suffered through such increased credit risk exposure could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face increased risks with respect to our WorldCurrency\u00ae and other market-based deposit products.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding market-based deposits of $0.8 billion, representing approximately 5% of our total deposits, the significant majority of which are WorldCurrency\u00ae deposits. Many of our WorldCurrency\u00ae depositors have chosen that family of products in order to diversify their portfolios with respect to foreign currencies. Appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies, political and economic disruptions in foreign markets or significant changes in commodity prices or securities indices could significantly reduce the demand for our WorldCurrency\u00ae and other market-based products as well as a devaluation of these deposit balances, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations. In addition, although we routinely use derivatives to offset changes to our deposit obligations due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, commodity prices or securities indices to which these products are linked, these derivatives may not be effective. To the extent that these derivatives do not offset changes to our deposit obligations, our financial results may be adversely affected.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and market area.\nWe face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources. Such competitors primarily include Internet banks and national, regional and community banks within the various markets we serve. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including, without limitation, savings and loan institutions, credit unions, mortgage companies, other finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, factoring companies and other financial intermediaries. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can (unless laws are changed) merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures.\nIn addition, many of our competitors have significantly more physical branch locations than we do, which may be an important factor to potential clients. Because we offer our services over the Internet, we compete nationally for clients against financial institutions ranging from small community banks to the largest international financial institutions. Many of our competitors continue to have access to greater financial resources than we have, which allows them to invest in technological improvements. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur historical growth rate and performance may not be indicative of our future growth or financial results.\nOur historical growth must be viewed in the context of the recent opportunities available to us as a result of the confluence of our access to capital at a time when market dislocations of historical proportions resulted in unprecedented asset acquisition opportunities. When evaluating our historical growth and prospects for future growth, it is also important to consider that while our business philosophy has remained relatively constant over time, our mix of business, distribution channels and areas of focus have changed frequently and dramatically over the last several years. Historically, we have entered and exited lines of business to adapt to changing market conditions and perceived opportunities, and may continue to do so in future periods.\nIn recent years, we have completed several significant transactions, including the acquisitions of MetLife Bank\u2019s warehouse finance business and Business Property Lending from GECC in 2012, Tygris and Bank of Florida in 2010 and the sale of our default servicing platform to Green Tree in 2014. These transactions, along with equity capital infusions, have significantly expanded our asset and capital base, product mix and distribution channels. We also benefited from significant purchase price discounts from certain of these transactions, which are highly accretive to our earnings and which may not be available in the future. Over the longer-term, we expect margins on loans to revert to longer-term historical levels.\nWe have historically generated a significant amount of fee income through the origination and servicing of residential mortgage loans. Fundamental changes in bank regulations and the mortgage industry, weak economic conditions and the historically low interest rate environment that has characterized the last several fiscal quarters make it difficult to predict our future results or draw meaningful comparisons between our historical results and our results in future fiscal periods. We materially increased our investments in residential MSR from 2008\nthrough the first quarter of 2010. During that time, we also significantly increased our investments in nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligation securities (CMOs). Due to concentration limits we adopted pursuant to new regulatory constraints and possible future regulatory guidance, our concentration in such asset classes has been reduced. We may not be able to achieve similar performance from alternative asset classes in the future.\nWe may not be able to sustain our historical rate of growth or grow our business at all. Because of prolonged economic uncertainty and governmental intervention in the credit markets and mortgage lending industry, as well as increased delinquencies, it will be difficult for us to replicate our historical earnings growth as we continue to expand. We have benefited from the ongoing low interest rate environment, which has provided us with high net interest margins which we use to grow our business. Higher rates would compress our margins and may impact our ability to grow. Consequently, our historical results of operations will not necessarily be indicative of our future operations.\nWe are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel could harm our business.\nOur future success significantly depends on the continued services and performance of our key management personnel. We believe our management team\u2019s depth and breadth of experience in the banking industry is integral to executing our business plan. We also will need to continue to attract, motivate and retain other key personnel. The loss of the services of members of our senior management team or other key employees or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to losses due to fraudulent and negligent acts on the part of loan applicants, correspondent lenders, other vendors and our employees.\nWhen we originate mortgage loans, we rely heavily upon information supplied by loan applicants and third parties, including the information contained in the loan application, property appraisal, title information and employment and income documentation provided by third parties. If any of this information is misrepresented and such misrepresentation is not detected prior to loan funding, we generally bear the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and accounting principles, or changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, may adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of our operations. Intended to protect clients, depositors, the DIF and the overall financial system, these laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on the business activities in which we can engage, limit the dividend or distributions that EverBank can pay to us, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee our debt, impose certain specific accounting requirements on us that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than generally accepted accounting principles, among other things. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs. We are currently facing increased regulation and supervision of our industry as a result of the financial crisis in the banking and financial markets, and, to the extent that we participate in any programs established or to be established by the U.S. Treasury or by the federal banking regulatory agencies, there will be additional and changing requirements and conditions imposed on us. Such additional regulation and supervision may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. Further, our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure is inadvertent or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines and other penalties, including criminal sanctions, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, capital base and the price of our securities.\nWe and EverBank have entered into a consent order with the OTS, and failure to comply with the requirements of the consent order could have a negative impact on us and/or EverBank.\nOn April 13, 2011, we and EverBank each entered into a consent order with the OTS with respect to EverBank\u2019s mortgage foreclosure practices and our oversight of those practices. The consent orders required, among other things, that we establish a new compliance program for our mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations and that we ensure that we have dedicated resources for communicating with borrowers, policies and procedures for outsourcing foreclosure or related functions and management information systems that ensure timely delivery of complete and accurate information. We were also required to retain an independent firm to conduct a review of residential foreclosure actions that were pending from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2010 in order to determine whether any borrowers sustained financial injury as a result of any errors, misrepresentations or deficiencies and to provide remediation as appropriate. We are working to fulfill the requirements of the consent orders. In response to the consent orders, we have established an oversight committee of the Board of Directors to monitor the implementation of the actions required by the consent orders. Furthermore, we have enhanced and updated several policies, procedures, processes and controls to help ensure the mitigation of the findings of the consent orders, and submitted them to the FRB and the OCC (the applicable successors to the OTS) for review. In addition, we have enhanced our third-party vendor management system and our compliance program, hired additional personnel and retained an independent firm to conduct foreclosure reviews.\nIn August 2013, EverBank reached an agreement with the OCC which ended its participation in the Independent Foreclosure Review program mandated by the April 2011 consent order and replaced it with an accelerated remediation process. The agreement included a cash payment of approximately $39.9 million made by EverBank to a settlement fund, which provides relief to qualified borrowers. In addition, we contributed approximately $6.3 million to organizations certified by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development or other tax-exempt organizations that have as a principal mission providing affordable housing, foreclosure prevention and/or educational assistance to low and moderate income individuals and families. This agreement has not eliminated all of our risks associated with foreclosure-related practices and it does not protect us from potential individual borrower claims or class actions lawsuits, which could result in additional expenses. Consistent with the agreement, an amendment to the April 2011 consent order was entered on October 15, 2013. All terms of the April 2011 consent order that were not explicitly superseded by the amendment remain in effect without modification. We may be subject to civil monetary penalties with respect to the consent order, but the federal banking agencies have not indicated what the amount of any such penalties would be.\nIn October 2013, we, along with other mortgage servicers, received a letter from the OCC requesting, in connection with the April 2011 consent order, that we provide the OCC with an action plan to identify errors and remediate any borrowers serviced by EverBank for the period from January 1, 2011 through the present day, that may have been harmed by the same errors identified in the Independent Foreclosure Review. EverBank submitted its action plan in 2013, and as of December 31, 2014, EverBank has accrued approximately $3.5 million for potential\nremediation payments to be made to borrowers. Any remedies or penalties that may be imposed on us as a result or arising out of the consent order, the action plan, or any other investigation or action related to mortgage origination or servicing may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, capital base and the price of our securities.\nMortgage servicing practices have also been the subject of a settlement agreement among the U.S. Department of Justice, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, 50 state attorneys general, and certain major mortgage servicers.\nThe OTS, the OCC and other government agencies, including state attorneys general and the U.S. Department of Justice, investigated various mortgage related practices of certain servicers, some of which practices were also the subject of the horizontal review. In March 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and 50 state attorneys general entered into separate consent judgments with five major mortgage servicers with respect to these matters. In total, the five mortgage servicers agreed to $25 billion in borrower restitution assistance and refinancing. Monetary sanctions imposed by the federal banking agencies as a consequence of the horizontal review are being held in abeyance, subject to provision of borrower assistance and remediation under the consent judgments. Certain other institutions subject to the consent decrees with the banking regulators announced in April 2011 have been contacted by the U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys general regarding a settlement. If an investigation of EverBank were to occur, it could result in material fines, penalties, equitable remedies (including requiring default servicing or other process changes), other enforcement actions or additional litigation, and could result in significant legal costs in responding to governmental investigations and additional litigation. Any other requirements or remedies or penalties that may be imposed on us as a result of the horizontal review or any other investigation or action related to mortgage origination or servicing may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, capital base and the price of our securities.\nWe anticipate that costs associated with foreclosures will remain high and may adversely affect us.\nWe expect that mortgage-related assessments and waivers, costs, including compensatory fees assessed by the GSEs, and other costs associated with foreclosures will remain elevated as additional loans are delayed in the foreclosure process. This will likely continue to increase noninterest expenses, including increasing default servicing costs and legal expenses. In addition, changes to our processes and policies, including those required under the consent orders with federal banking regulators, are likely to result in further increases in our default servicing costs over the longer term. Delays in foreclosure sales may result in additional costs associated with the maintenance of properties or possible home price declines, result in a greater number of nonperforming loans and increased servicing advances and may adversely affect the collectability of such advances and the value of our MSR asset and other real estate owned properties. In addition, the valuation of certain of our agency residential MBS could be negatively affected under certain scenarios due to changes in the timing of cash flows.\nGovernmental and other actions relating to recording mortgages in the name of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS) may have adverse consequences on us.\nMortgage notes, assignments or other documents are often required to be maintained and are often necessary to enforce mortgages loans. There has been significant public commentary regarding the industry practice of recording mortgages in the name of MERS, as nominee on behalf of the note holder, and whether securitization trusts own the loans purported to be conveyed to them and have valid liens securing those loans. We currently use the MERS system for a substantial portion of the residential mortgage loans that we originate, including loans that have been sold to investors. A component of the consent orders described above requires significant changes in the manner in which we service loans identifying MERS as the mortgagee. Additionally, certain local and state governments have commenced legal actions against MERS and certain MERS members, questioning the validity of the MERS model. Other challenges have also been made to the process for transferring mortgage loans to securitization trusts, asserting that having a mortgagee of record that is different than the holder of the mortgage note could \u2018break the chain of title\u2019 and cloud the ownership of the loan. If certain required documents are missing or defective, or if the use of MERS is found not to be valid, we could be obligated to cure certain defects or in some circumstances be subject to additional costs and expenses in servicing mortgages. Our use of MERS as nominee for mortgages may also create reputational and other risks for us.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and supervision and possible enforcement actions.\nWe and EverBank are subject to comprehensive supervision and regulation that affect virtually all aspects of our operations, and a significant amount of discretion is vested in the various regulatory authorities. This supervision and regulation is designed primarily to protect depositors and other customers and the DIF administered by the FDIC, and the banking system as a whole, and generally is not intended for the protection of stockholders. This regulation and supervision affects most aspects of our business, including lending practices, capital structure, dividend policy, and growth. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, instituted major regulatory, supervisory, and compliance changes. The key effects of the Dodd-Frank Act on our business are:\n\u2022\nchanges in the thrift supervisory structure;\n\u2022\nchanges to regulatory capital requirements;\n\u2022\ncreation of new governmental agencies with authority over our operations including the CFPB;\n\u2022\nlimitation on federal preemption; and\n\u2022\nchanges to mortgage loan origination and risk retention practices.\nFor a more detailed description of the Dodd-Frank Act, see \u201cSupervision and Regulation.\u201d\nOther changes to statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies or supervisory guidance, including changes in their interpretation or implementation, may affect us in substantial ways that we cannot predict. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies, or guidance could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies and other law enforcement authorities, including civil money penalties or fines or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operation.\nIn addition the CFPB issued rules that were effective as of January 2014 and that require servicers to comply with new standards and practices with regard to: error correction; information disclosure; force-placement of insurance; information management policies and procedures; requiring information about mortgage loss mitigation options be provided to delinquent borrowers; providing delinquent borrowers access to servicer personnel with continuity of contact about the borrower\u2019s mortgage loan account; and evaluating borrowers\u2019 applications for available loss mitigation options. These rules also address initial rate adjustment notices for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), periodic\nstatements for residential mortgage loans, and prompt crediting of mortgage payments and response to requests for payoff amounts. As a result of these new regulations, we will likely see increased regulatory and compliance costs, which we may not be able to pass on to consumers.\nThe ability-to-repay requirement for residential mortgage loans may limit our ability to sell or securitize certain of our mortgage loans and may give borrowers potential claims against us.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act amended the Truth-in-Lending Act to require that mortgage lenders show that they have verified the borrower\u2019s ability to repay a residential mortgage loan. Lenders of mortgages that meet a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d standard have a safe harbor or a presumption of compliance with the requirement. Under final rules issued by the CFPB, qualified mortgages cannot have negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, terms over 30 years, or points and fees over certain thresholds. From time to time, we may originate mortgages that do not meet the \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d definition. In the event that we do originate such mortgages, however, we could be subject to statutory claims for violations of this requirement. In addition, if institutional mortgage investors limit their mortgage purchases, demand for our non-qualifying mortgages in the secondary market may be significantly limited in the future. If demand for our non-qualifying mortgages in the secondary market declines, we would be limited in our ability to resell such mortgages which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are subject to more stringent capital standards.\nWe are subject to regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital that we must maintain. From time to time, the regulators change these capital adequacy guidelines. If we fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, we or our subsidiaries may be restricted in the types of activities we may conduct and may be prohibited from taking certain capital actions, such as paying dividends and repurchasing or redeeming capital securities.\nIn particular, the capital requirements applicable to us and EverBank under the recently adopted Basel III Capital Rules began to be phased-in starting in 2015. EverBank is required to satisfy additional, more stringent, capital adequacy standards than it has in the past, and we, as a savings and loan holding company, are subject to consolidated risk-based capital requirements for the first time. The Basel III Capital Rules, among other things, limit our ability to include certain assets, including MSR, in our calculation of our regulatory capital ratios. MSR currently comprise a significant portion of our regulatory capital. At December 31, 2014, our net MSR totaled $435.6 million. For a more detailed description of the Basel III Capital Rules, see \u201cRegulation and Supervision.\u201d Additionally, stress testing requirements may have the effect of requiring us or EverBank to comply with the requirements of the Basel III Capital Rules, or potentially even greater capital requirements, sooner than expected. While we and EverBank expect to meet the requirements of the Basel III Capital Rules, inclusive of the capital conservation buffer, as phased in by the FRB, we or EverBank may fail to do so. In that case, we may be required to raise additional capital at less attractive terms. In addition, these requirements could have a negative impact on our ability to lend, grow deposit balances, make acquisitions and make capital distributions in the form of increased dividends or share repurchases. Higher capital levels could also lower our earnings and return on equity.\nUnfavorable results from ongoing stress tests conducted by us may adversely affect our ability to retain clients or compete for new business opportunities.\nWe and EverBank will be required to publish a summary of the results of annual company-run stress tests. Published summary results will be required to include certain measures that evaluate our and EverBank\u2019s ability to absorb losses in severely adverse economic and financial conditions. We cannot predict how our clients will interpret and react to the published summary of these stress tests. Any potential misinterpretations and adverse reactions could limit our ability to attract and retain clients or to effectively compete for new business opportunities. The inability to attract and retain clients or effectively compete for new business may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAdditionally, our regulators may require us or EverBank to raise additional capital or take other actions, or may impose restrictions on our business, based on the results of the stress tests. We may not be able to raise additional capital if required to do so, or may not be able to do so on terms which are advantageous to us or our current stockholders. Any such capital raises, if required, may also be dilutive to our existing stockholders.\nWe are highly dependent upon programs administered by government agencies or government-sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, to generate liquidity in connection with our conforming mortgage loans. Any changes in existing U.S. government or government-sponsored mortgage programs could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to generate revenues through securities issuances guaranteed by GNMA, and through mortgage loan sales to GSEs such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (as well as to other institutional investors), depends to a significant degree on programs administered by those entities. The GSEs play a powerful role in the residential mortgage industry, and we have significant business relationships with them. Many of the loans that we originate are conforming loans that qualify under existing standards for sale to the GSEs or for guarantee by GNMA. We also derive other material financial benefits from these relationships, including the assumption of credit risk by these GSEs on all loans sold to them that are pooled into securities, in exchange for our payment of guaranty fees, and the ability to avoid certain loan inventory finance costs through streamlined loan funding and sale procedures. Any discontinuation of, or significant reduction in, the operation of these GSEs or any significant adverse change in the level of activity in the secondary mortgage market or the underwriting criteria of these GSEs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nBecause nearly all other non-governmental participants providing liquidity in the secondary mortgage market left that market during the mortgage financial crisis, the GSEs have been the only significant purchasers of residential mortgage loans. It remains unclear when private investors may begin to re-enter the market in a meaningful way. As described above, GSEs (which are in conservatorship, with heavy capital support from the U.S. government, and subject to serious speculation about their future structure, if any) may not be able to provide the substantial liquidity upon which our residential mortgage loan business relies.\nFederal, state and local consumer lending laws may restrict our ability to originate or increase our risk of liability with respect to certain mortgage loans and could increase our cost of doing business.\nFederal, state and local laws have been adopted that are intended to eliminate certain lending practices considered \u201cpredatory.\u201d These laws prohibit practices such as steering borrowers away from more affordable products, selling unnecessary insurance to borrowers, repeatedly refinancing loans, and making loans without a reasonable expectation that the borrowers will be able to repay the loans irrespective of the value of the underlying property. It is our policy not to make predatory loans, but these laws create the potential for liability with respect to our lending, servicing and loan investment activities. They increase our cost of doing business, and ultimately may prevent us from making certain loans and cause us to reduce the average percentage rate or the points and fees on loans that we do make.\nLegislative action regarding foreclosures or bankruptcy laws may negatively impact our business.\nRecent laws delay the initiation or completion of foreclosure proceedings on specified types of residential mortgage loans (some for a limited period of time), or otherwise limit the ability of residential loan servicers to take actions that may be essential to preserve the value of the mortgage loans underlying the MSR. Any such limitations are likely to cause delayed or reduced collections from mortgagors and generally increased servicing costs. Any restriction on our ability to foreclose on a loan, any requirement that we forego a portion of the amount otherwise due on a loan or any requirement that we modify any original loan terms will in some instances require us to advance principal, interest, tax and insurance payments, which is likely to negatively impact our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to environmental liabilities with respect to properties that we take title to upon foreclosure that could increase our costs of doing business and harm our results of operations.\nIn the course of our activities, we may foreclose and take title to residential and commercial properties and become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to those properties. The laws and regulations related to environmental contamination often impose liability without regard to responsibility for the contamination. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. Moreover, as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based upon damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we ever become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations would be significantly harmed.\nAnti-takeover provisions could adversely affect our stockholders.\nWe are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nlimit the ability of a person to own, control or have the power to vote more than 9.9% of our voting securities;\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors, with directors of each class serving a three-year term;\n\u2022\nrequire that directors only be removed from office for cause and only upon a majority stockholder vote;\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our Board of Directors, including newly created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u2022\nlimit who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders; and\n\u2022\nrequire supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws.\nIn addition, there are substantial regulatory limitations on changes of control of savings and loan holding companies and federal savings associations. Any company that acquires control of a savings association becomes a \u201csavings and loan holding company\u201d subject to registration, examination and regulation by the FRB. \u201cControl,\u201d as defined under federal banking regulations, includes ownership or control of shares, or holding irrevocable proxies (or a combination thereof), representing 25% or more of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the institution\u2019s directors, or a determination by the FRB that the acquirer has the power to direct, or directly or indirectly to exercise a controlling influence over, the management or policies of the institution. Further, an acquisition of 10% or more of our common stock creates a rebuttable presumption of \u201ccontrol\u201d under federal banking regulations. Additionally, there may be enhanced scrutiny of investments of less than 5% or more of any class of our common stock if certain control factors are present, including the amount of the investor\u2019s proposed total capital investment.
