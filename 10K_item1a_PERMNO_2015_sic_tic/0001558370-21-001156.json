{"cik": "1011509", "company": "Golden Minerals Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-18", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A:RISK FACTORS\nInvestors in Golden Minerals should consider carefully, in addition to the other information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this annual report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors:\nRisk Factors related to our Financial Circumstances\nWe are an exploration stage company and do not have a long-term source of revenue.\nWe have a history of operating losses and have not successfully produced revenue from mining operations since 2015. Although we expect our Rodeo project to generate revenue and free cash flow commencing in 2021, that project is short-lived and is not expected to generate significant cash flow beyond 2023. We are evaluating other potential mining activities, including a potential restart of production at the Velarde\u00f1a Properties. However, we do not currently have any mining activities scheduled to commence after the termination of production at the Rodeo property.\nIf we are unable to generate revenue from another mining property, we will be dependent on future external financing to fund our corporate expenses and exploration and development activities. There is no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all. See \u201cRisk Factors - We may not have access to sufficient future capital.\u201d\nWe may not have access to sufficient future capital.\nAlthough the Rodeo property is expected to generate revenue and free cash flow through 2023, we expect to require additional external financing to fund our continuing business activities. Additional capital would be required to fund general and administrative costs if our revenue and cash flow projections for Rodeo are not realized. Moreover, additional capital may be required in order to continue to advance our other projects.\nWe do not have a credit, off-take or other commercial financing arrangement in place that would finance our general and administrative costs and other working capital needs to fund our continuing business activities in the future, and we believe that securing credit for these purposes would be challenging. In addition, commercial financing arrangements may not be available on favorable terms or on terms that would not further restrict our flexibility and ongoing ability to meet our cash requirements over a reasonable period of time. We also may not be able to obtain funding by monetizing additional non-core exploration or other assets at an acceptable price.\nAlthough we may be able to access public equity markets, including through issuances under out At the Market Offering Program with H.C. Wainwright & Co. (\u201cATM Program\u201d) or the committed equity program with Lincoln Park\nCapital that we entered into in May 2018 (the \u201cLPC Program\u201d), significant equity issuances may be dilutive to our existing stockholders.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain financing to fund our general and administrative costs and other working capital needs to fund our continuing business activities in the future on favorable terms or at all.\nRisk Factors related to our Mining and Processing Activities\nWe have not established proven or probable mineral reserves at our only producing property, the Rodeo project.\nWe have not established proven or probable reserves, as defined by the SEC under Industry Guide 7 or Canadian securities regulators, at the Rodeo mine. In order to establish proven reserves under SEC Industry Guide 7, we would be required to prepare a final, \u201cbankable\u201d feasibility study. Due to the size of the Rodeo deposit and the relatively short anticipated mine life, we do not believe it is necessary to incur the expense and delay involved in preparing a bankable feasibility study in order to bring the Rodeo project into production. As a result, despite the fact that we have undertaken confirmatory drilling to provide additional certainty regarding the Rodeo deposit, there is an increased uncertainty and risk that may result in economic and technical failure which may adversely impact our future profitability. Our production and after-tax cash flow estimates at the Rodeo mine are based in part on the mineralized material estimate. Therefore, because the estimate does not constitute proven reserves under SEC Industry Guide 7, the production and after-tax cash flow estimates which are derived therefrom are inherently more uncertain than would otherwise be the case if the Rodeo mine were supported by a bankable feasibility study and estimate of proven reserves established in accordance with Industry Guide 7.\nOur ability to achieve the cash flow and profitability predicted at the Rodeo mine will be affected by changes in prices of silver and gold.\nWe estimate approximately $9.0 million to $10.5 million in after-tax cash flow from the Rodeo mine during 2021. This estimate is based on an average silver price of $25.00 per ounce and an average gold price of $1,800 throughout 2021. Our ability to achieve our revenue and cash flow forecast is dependent, in large part, on the market prices of silver and gold. The market prices for these metals are volatile and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including (i) global or regional consumption patterns; (ii) supply of and demand for silver and gold on a worldwide basis; (iii) speculative and hedging activities; (iv) expectations for inflation; (v) political and economic conditions; (vi) supply of, and demand for, consumables required for extraction and processing of metals, and (vii) general economic conditions worldwide. We have no ability to influence the price of silver and gold.\nThe assumptions behind our estimates of cash flow and profitability at the Rodeo mine are inherently subject to uncertainty.\nOur decision to commence production at the Rodeo mine was based on a Preliminary Economic Assessment that was completed in April 2020, as well as subsequent drilling and metallurgical work. In making the decision to commence mining, we made certain assumptions regarding operating and capital costs and project economic returns. These estimates of average cash operating costs are based upon, among other things (i) anticipated tonnage, grades and metallurgical characteristics of the ore to be mined and processed; (ii) anticipated recovery rates of silver and other metals from the ore; (iii) cash operating costs of comparable facilities and equipment; and (iv) anticipated climatic conditions. Actual cash operating costs, production and economic returns may differ significantly from those anticipated by our studies and estimates.\nWe are party to a collective bargaining agreement with a union in Mexico that, together with labor and employment regulations, could adversely affect our mining activities and financial condition.\nMine employees in Mexico are typically represented by a union, and our relationship with our employees is, and we expect in the future will be, governed in part by collective bargaining agreements. Any collective bargaining agreement that we enter into with a union is likely to restrict our mining flexibility in and impose additional costs on our mining activities. In addition, relations between us and our employees in Mexico may be affected by changes in regulations or labor union requirements regarding labor relations that may be introduced by the Mexican authorities or by labor unions. Changes in legislation or in the relationship between us and our employees may have a material adverse effect on our mining activities and financial condition.\nProducts processed from our Rodeo project or other mines in the future could contain higher than expected contaminants, thereby negatively impacting our financial condition.\nTreatment charges paid to smelters and refineries include penalties for certain elements, including arsenic and antimony that exceed contract limits. If the material mined from our Rodeo project includes higher than expected contaminants, this would result in higher treatment expenses and penalty charges that could increase our costs and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. This could occur due to unexpected variations in the occurrence of these elements in the material mined, problems that occur during blending of material from various locations in the mine prior to processing and other unanticipated events.\nMining and processing activities are dependent on the availability of sufficient water supplies to support our mining activities.\nProcessing activities at the Velarde\u00f1a Properties require significant amounts of water. At the Velarde\u00f1a Properties, our ability to have sufficient water is dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims. Water is provided for all of the mines comprising our Velarde\u00f1a Properties by wells located in the valley adjacent to the Velarde\u00f1a Properties. We hold title to three wells located near the sulfide plant and hold certificates of registration to three wells located near the oxide plant. We are licensed to pump water from all six wells up to a permitted amount. We are currently using water from the three wells associated with the oxide plant and from two of the three wells associated with the sulfide plant. We are required to make annual payments to the Mexican government to maintain our rights to these wells. We are required to pay a fine to the Mexican Government each year if we use too much water from a particular well or alternatively if we do not use a minimum amount of water from a particular well. In addition to these fines, the Mexican Government reserves the right to cancel our title to the wells for abuse of these rules.\nWe believe we currently have a sufficient amount of water for our expected processing activities at the plant. However, if we began processing material through both the sulfide and oxide plants in the future, we may face shortages in our water supply, and therefore will need to obtain water from outside sources at higher costs. The loss of some or all water rights for any of our wells, in whole or in part, or shortages of water to which we have rights would require us to seek water from outside sources at higher costs and could require us to curtail or shut down mining and processing in the future. Laws and regulations may be introduced in the future which could limit our access to sufficient water resources in mining activities, thus adversely affecting our business.\nThere are significant hazards involved in possible future underground mining and processing activities at our Velarde\u00f1a Properties, not all of which would be fully covered by insurance.\nWhile we are not currently conducting mining operations at the Velarde\u00f1a Properties, we are evaluating a potential restart of production. Because the Velarde\u00f1a mines are underground, potential mining activities, as well as the conduct of our exploration programs that frequently require rehabilitation of and drilling in underground mine workings, are subject to numerous risks and hazards inherent in underground mines. These risks include, for example, unforeseen environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected geological formations, formation pressures, cave-ins, underground fires or floods, power outages, seismic activity, rock bursts, accidents relating to historical workings, landslides and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions. These occurrences could result in\ndamage to, or destruction of, mineral properties or processing facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, reduced extraction and processing and delays in mining, asset write-downs, monetary losses and possible legal liability. Although we maintain insurance against risks inherent in the conduct of our business in amounts that we consider reasonable, this insurance contains exclusions and limitations on coverage, and will not cover all potential risks associated with mining and exploration activities, and related liabilities might exceed policy limits. As a result of any or all of the forgoing, we could incur significant liabilities and costs that could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.\nRisk Factors related to our Exploration and Development Activities\nOur exploration properties may not contain mineral reserves.\nWe are considered an exploration stage company under SEC Industry Guide 7, and none of our properties have been shown to contain proven or probable mineral reserves as defined under Industry Guide 7. Expenditures made in mining at our properties may not result in positive cash flow or in discoveries of commercially recoverable quantities of ore. Most exploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable ore deposits, and we cannot assure you that any mineral deposit we identify will qualify as an orebody that can be legally and economically exploited or that any particular level of recovery from discovered mineralization will in fact be realized.\nOur mineralized material estimates are inherently imprecise.\nWe have released estimates of mineralized material at the Rodeo project, the El Quevar project and the Velarde\u00f1a Properties. Mineralized material figures based on estimates made by geologists are inherently imprecise and depend on geological interpretation and statistical inferences drawn from drilling and sampling that may prove to be unreliable or inaccurate. We cannot assure you that these estimates are accurate, and even if the estimates are accurate, the economic viability of the project may not justify exploitation.\nThe exploration of our mineral properties is highly speculative in nature, involves substantial expenditures and is frequently non-productive.\nMineral exploration is highly speculative in nature and frequently results in no or very little return on amounts invested to evaluate a particular property. Substantial expenditures are required to (i) establish the existence of a potential ore body through drilling and metallurgical and other testing techniques; (ii) determine metal content and metallurgical recovery processes to process metal from the ore; (iii) determine the feasibility of mine development and production; and (iv) construct, renovate or expand mining and processing facilities. If we discover a deposit or ore at a property, it usually takes several years from the initial phases of exploration until production is possible, if at all. During this time, the economic feasibility of a project may change because of increased costs, lower metal prices or other factors. As a result of these uncertainties, our exploration programs may not result in the identification of proven and probable reserves in sufficient quantities to justify developing a particular property.\nWe may not mine the Velarde\u00f1a Properties again.\nIn mid-November 2015, we shut down the mines and sulfide processing plant at our Velarde\u00f1a Properties and placed them on care and maintenance. Commencing mining again is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u25cfwhether we are able to create a mine plan or gold recovery improvements that can achieve sustainable cash positive results at current and future metals prices;\n\u25cfunexpected events, including difficulties in maintaining the properties on a care and maintenance basis, potential sabotage or damage to the assets related to the suspension of mining, and variations in ore grade and relative amounts, grades and metallurgical characteristics of oxide and sulfide ores;\n\u25cfwhether gold and silver prices will achieve or remain at sufficiently high levels to permit us to achieve sustainable cash positive results;\n\u25cfwhether actual holding and care and maintenance costs exceed current estimates or whether unanticipated costs arise;\n\u25cfwhether we are able to retain sufficient numbers of skilled mining and management personnel and otherwise maintain satisfactory relations with the unionized workforce on site; and\n\u25cfour ability to obtain additional funding for general and administrative costs and other working capital needs to fund our continuing business activities as currently conducted and possibly for a potential restart of our Velarde\u00f1a Properties.\nBased on these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that we will restart mining activities at the Velarde\u00f1a Properties.\nMost of our properties are subject to foreign environmental laws and regulations which could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are conducting mining activities in Mexico and conduct mineral exploration activities in Mexico and Argentina. Both jurisdictions have laws and regulations that control the exploration and mining of mineral properties and their effects on the environment, including air and water quality, mine reclamation, waste generation, handling and disposal, the protection of different species of flora and fauna and the preservation of lands. These laws and regulations require us to acquire permits and other authorizations for conducting certain activities. In many countries, there is relatively new comprehensive environmental legislation, and the permitting and authorization process may not be established or predictable. We may not be able to acquire necessary permits or authorizations on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in acquiring any permit or authorization could increase the cost of our projects and could suspend or delay the commencement of extraction and processing of mineralized material.\nOur Rodeo and Velarde\u00f1a properties are subject to regulation by SEMARNAT, the environmental protection agency of Mexico. In order to permit new facilities at or expand existing facilities, regulations require that an environmental impact statement, known in Mexico as a Manifestaci\u00f3n de Impacto Ambiental (the \u201cManifestaci\u00f3n\u201d), be prepared by a third-party contractor for submission to SEMARNAT. Studies required to support the Manifestaci\u00f3n include a detailed analysis of soil, water, vegetation, wildlife, cultural resources and socio-economic impacts. The Manifestaci\u00f3n is then published on SEMARNAT\u2019s web page and in its official gazette in a national and local newspaper. The Manifestaci\u00f3n is discussed at various open hearings, including hearings in the local communities, at which third parties may voice their views. We would be required to provide proof of local community support of the Manifestaci\u00f3n as a condition to final approval. We may not be able to obtain community support of future projects.\nEnvironmental legislation in Mexico is evolving in a manner which will require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. Future changes in environmental regulation in the jurisdictions where our Rodeo and Velarde\u00f1a properties are located may adversely affect our business, make our business prohibitively expensive, or prohibit it altogether.\nEnvironmental legislation in many other countries, in addition to Mexico, is evolving in a manner that will likely require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. We cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted or adopted in the future or how future laws and regulations will be administered or interpreted. Compliance with more stringent laws and regulations,\nas well as potentially more vigorous enforcement policies or regulatory agencies or stricter interpretation of existing laws, may (i) necessitate significant capital outlays, (ii) cause us to delay, terminate or otherwise change our intended activities with respect to one or more projects, or (iii) materially adversely affect our future exploration activities.\nMany of our properties are located in areas of prior mining activity and we may encounter legacy environmental damage.\nThe Velarde\u00f1a Properties and many of our exploration properties are located in historic mining districts where prior owners, including ECU in the case of the Velarde\u00f1a Properties, may have caused environmental damage that may not be known to us or to applicable regulators. At the Velarde\u00f1a Properties and in most other cases, we have not conducted comprehensive environmental analyses of our mineral properties. Insurance fully covering many environmental risks (including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and mining) is not generally available. To the extent environmental hazards may exist on the properties in which we currently hold interests, or may hold interests in the future, that are unknown to us at present and that have been caused by us, or previous owners or operators, or that may have occurred naturally, and to the extent we are subject to environmental requirements or liabilities, the cost of compliance with these requirements and satisfaction of these liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to fully fund the cost of remediation of any environmental condition, we may be required to suspend activities or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remediation.\nClimate change and climate change legislation or regulations could impact our business.\nWe are subject to risks associated with climate change which could seriously harm our results of operations and increase our costs and expenses. The occurrence of severe adverse weather conditions, including increased temperatures, hail, droughts, fires or floods, may have a potentially devastating impact on our operations. Adverse weather may result in physical damage to our operations, instability of our infrastructure and equipment, washed-out roads to our projects, and alter the supply of water and electricity to our mining sites and oxide plant. Increased temperatures may also decrease worker productivity at our projects and raise cooling costs. Should the impacts of climate change be material in nature or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition or results of operations would be adversely affected.\nU.S. or international legislative or regulatory action intended to ensure the protection of the environment are constantly changing and evolving in a manner expected to result in stricter standards and enforcement, larger fines and liability, and potentially increased capital expenditures and operating costs. While we will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations regarding such matters, we currently believe that the impact of such legislation on our business will not be significant.\nMost of our exploration properties, including our Rodeo and Velarde\u00f1a properties, are located in Mexico and are subject to various levels of political, economic, legal, social and other risks.\nOur Rodeo and Velarde\u00f1a properties are located in Mexico, and, as such, are exposed to various levels of political, economic, legal and other risks and uncertainties, including local acts of violence, such as violence from drug cartels; military repression; extreme fluctuations in currency exchange rates; high rates of inflation; labor unrest; the risks of war or civil unrest; expropriation and nationalization; renegotiation or nullification of existing concessions, licenses, permits and contracts; illegal mining; acts of political corruption; changes in taxation policies; restrictions on foreign exchange and repatriation; and changing political conditions, currency controls and governmental regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction.\nIn the past, Mexico has been subject to political instability, changes and uncertainties, which have resulted in changes to existing governmental regulations affecting mineral exploration and mining activities. Mexico\u2019s status as a\ndeveloping country may make it more difficult for us to obtain any required funding for our Rodeo project, Velarde\u00f1a Properties or other projects in Mexico in the future.\nOur Mexican properties are subject to a variety of governmental regulations governing health and worker safety, employment standards, waste disposal, protection of historic and archaeological sites, mine development, protection of endangered and protected species, purchase, storage and use of explosives and other matters. Specifically, our activities related to the Rodeo and Velarde\u00f1a properties are subject to regulation by SEMARNAT, the Comisi\u00f3n Nacional del Agua, which regulates water rights, and Mexican mining laws. Mexican regulators have broad authority to shut down and levy fines against facilities that do not comply with regulations or standards.\nOur Rodeo and Velarde\u00f1a properties and mineral exploration activities in Mexico may be adversely affected in varying degrees by changing government regulations relating to the mining industry or shifts in political conditions that increase the costs related to our mining and exploration activities or the maintenance of our properties. For example, in January 2014, amendments to the Mexico federal corporate income tax law require titleholders of mining concessions to pay annually a 7.5% duty of their mining related profits and a 0.5% duty on revenues obtained from the sale of gold, silver and platinum that were effective March 2015. These additional duties applicable to Mexico mining concession titleholders will have a significant impact on the annual costs applicable to the Rodeo and Velarde\u00f1a properties if we have mining-related profits or significant revenues in the future.\nChanges, if any, in mining or investment policies, changes or increases in the legal rights of indigenous populations or in the difficulty or expense of obtaining rights from them that are necessary for our Rodeo or Velarde\u00f1a properties or shifts in political attitude may adversely affect our business and financial condition. Our mining and exploration activities may be affected in varying degrees by government regulations with respect to restrictions on extraction, price controls, export controls, currency remittance, income and other taxes, expropriation of property, foreign investment, maintenance of claims, environmental legislation, land use, land claims of local people, water use and mine safety. Restart of mining or use of both the oxide and sulfide plant may also require us to assure the availability of adequate supplies of water and power, which could be affected by government policy and competing businesses in the area. The occurrence of these various factors and uncertainties cannot be accurately predicted and could have an adverse effect on our mining and exploration activities and financial condition.\nFuture changes in applicable laws and regulations or changes in their enforcement or regulatory interpretation could negatively impact current or planned exploration or mining activities at our Rodeo or Velarde\u00f1a properties or in respect of any of our other projects in Mexico or projects with which we become involved in Mexico. Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, even if inadvertent, could result in the interruption of mining and exploration or material fines, penalties or other liabilities.\nOur El Quevar exploration property is located in Argentina and is subject to various levels of political, economic, legal, social and other risks.\nOur El Quevar exploration property is located in Argentina and, as such, is exposed to various levels of political, economic, legal, social and other risks and uncertainties, including high interest rates; abrupt changes in currency values; high levels of inflation; stability and competitiveness of the Argentine peso against foreign currencies; wage and price controls; regulations to import equipment and other necessities relevant for operations; changes in governmental economic (including export duties and import regulations) or tax policies; and political and social tensions.\nThe Argentine economy has experienced significant volatility in recent decades, characterized by periods of low or negative gross domestic product growth, high and variable levels of inflation and currency depreciation and devaluation. Financial and securities markets in Argentina, and the Argentine economy, are influenced by economic and market conditions in other markets worldwide. The Argentine government has often changed monetary, taxation, credit, tariff and other policies to influence the course of Argentina\u2019s economy, and taken other actions which do, or may be perceived to weaken the nation\u2019s economy especially as it relates to foreign investors and the overall investment climate.\nThe Argentine government has not only historically exercised significant influence over the country\u2019s economy, but the country\u2019s legal and regulatory frameworks have at times suffered radical changes due to political influence and significant political uncertainties as well. For example, in April 2014, there were nationwide strikes that paralyzed the Argentine economy, shutting down air, train and bus traffic, closing businesses and ports, emptying classrooms, shutting down non-emergency hospital attention and leaving trash uncollected. This is consistent with past periods of significant economic unrest and social and political turmoil. Future government policies to preempt, or in response to, social unrest may include expropriation, nationalization, forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts, suspension of the enforcement of creditors\u2019 rights, new taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims, and changes in laws and policies affecting foreign trade and investment. Such policies could destabilize the country and adversely and materially affect the economy, and thereby our business.\nTitle to the Rodeo project, Velarde\u00f1a Properties and our other properties and rights may be defective or may be challenged.\nOur policy is to seek to confirm the validity of our rights to, title to, or contract rights with respect to, each mineral property in which we have a material interest. However, we cannot guarantee that title to our properties will not be challenged. Title insurance is not available for our mineral properties, and our ability to ensure that we have obtained secure rights to individual mineral properties or mining concessions may be severely constrained. Accordingly, the Rodeo project, Velarde\u00f1a Properties and our other mineral properties may be subject to prior unregistered agreements, transfers or claims, and title may be affected by, among other things, undetected defects. In addition, we may be unable to conduct activities on our properties as permitted or to enforce our rights with respect to our properties, and the title to our mineral properties may also be impacted by state action. We have not conducted surveys of all of the exploration properties in which we hold direct or indirect interests and, therefore, the precise area and location of these exploration properties may be in doubt.\nIn most of the countries in which we operate, failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to mineral right applications and tenure could result in loss, reduction or expropriation of entitlements, or the imposition of additional local or foreign parties as joint venture partners. Any such loss, reduction or imposition of partners could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nUnder the laws of Mexico, mineral resources belong to the state, and government concessions are required to explore for or exploit mineral reserves. Mineral rights derive from concessions granted, on a discretionary basis, by the Ministry of Economy, pursuant to the Mexican mining law and regulations thereunder. We hold title to the Rodeo project, Velarde\u00f1a Properties and our other properties in Mexico through these government concessions, but there is no assurance that title to the concessions comprising the Rodeo project, Velarde\u00f1a Properties and other properties will not be challenged or impaired. The Rodeo project, Velarde\u00f1a Properties and other properties may be subject to prior unregistered agreements, interests or native land claims, and title may be affected by undetected defects. There could be valid challenges to the title of any of the claims comprising the Rodeo project, Velarde\u00f1a Properties that, if successful, could impair mining with respect to such properties in the future. A defect could result in our losing all or a portion of our right, title, and interest in and to the properties to which the title defect relates.\nOur Rodeo project mining concessions, Velarde\u00f1a Properties mining concessions and our other mining concessions in Mexico may be terminated if our obligations to maintain the concessions in good standing are not satisfied, including obligations to explore or exploit the relevant concession, to pay any relevant fees, to comply with all environmental and safety standards, to provide information to the Ministry of Economy and to allow inspections by the Ministry of Economy. In addition to termination, failure to make timely concession maintenance payments and otherwise comply strictly with applicable laws, regulations and local practices relating to mineral right applications and tenure could result in reduction or expropriation of entitlements. Additionally, in 2014, new mining concessions became subject to additional review and approval by the Mexico Ministry of Energy, and in recent years the federal government has been reluctant to issue new mining concessions at all.\nMining concessions in Mexico give exclusive exploration and exploitation rights to the minerals located in the concessions but do not include surface rights to the real property, which requires that we negotiate the necessary agreements with surface landowners. Many of our mining properties are subject to the Mexican ejido system requiring us to contract with the local communities surrounding the properties in order to obtain surface rights to land needed in connection with our mining exploration activities. In connection with our Velarde\u00f1a Properties, we have contracts with two ejidos to secure surface rights with a total annual cost of approximately $25,000. The first contract is a ten-year contract with the Velarde\u00f1a ejido, which provides surface rights to certain roads and other infrastructure at the Velarde\u00f1a Properties through 2021. The second contract is a 25-year contract with the Vista Hermosa ejido signed in March 2013, which provides exploration access and access rights for roads and utilities for our Velarde\u00f1a Properties. Similar to our Velarde\u00f1a Properties, the Rodeo project is subject to the Mexican ejido system. We believe, although we cannot be certain, that our agreement with the local ejidos to allow access to the property will be sufficient to conduct our proposed mining activities. We also have a separate surface rights agreement in place with a local private landowner that allows us to conduct mining operations on the two concessions that make up the Rodeo property. Our inability to maintain and periodically renew or expand these surface rights on favorable terms or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nMost of our costs are subject to exchange control policies, the effects of inflation and currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Mexican peso.\nOur revenue and external funding are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, certain mining, processing, maintenance and exploration costs at the Rodeo and Velarde\u00f1a properties and most of our exploration properties are denominated in Mexican pesos. These costs principally include electricity, labor, water, maintenance, local contractors and fuel. When inflation in Mexico increases without a corresponding devaluation of the Mexican peso, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. The annual average inflation rate in Mexico was approximately 3.2% in 2020, 3.6% in 2019, and 4.9% in 2018. At the same time, the peso has been subject to fluctuation, which may not have been proportionate to the inflation rate and may not be proportionate to the inflation rate in the future. The value of the peso decreased by 4.7% in 2020, increased by 3.6% in 2019, and decreased by 0.5% in 2018. In addition, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may have a significant impact on our financial results. There can be no assurance that the Mexican government will maintain its current policies with regard to the peso or that the peso's value will not fluctuate significantly in the future. We cannot assure you that currency fluctuations, inflation and exchange control policies will not have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, earnings and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to obtain all of our required governmental permits or obtain property rights on favorable terms or at all, our business could be negatively impacted.\nFuture mining and current processing at our Rodeo and Velarde\u00f1a properties, the continued evaluation of the El Quevar project and other exploration activities will require additional permits from various governmental authorities. Our business is and will continue to be governed by laws and regulations governing mining, exploration, prospecting, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, toxic substances, land use, environmental protection, mine safety, mining royalties and other matters. We may also be required to obtain certain property rights to access or use our properties. Obtaining or renewing licenses and permits, and acquiring property rights, can be complex and time-consuming processes. There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire all required licenses, permits or property rights on reasonable terms or in a timely manner, or at all, and that such terms will not be adversely changed, that required extensions will be granted, or that the issuance of such licenses, permits or property rights will not be challenged by third parties. Delays in obtaining or a failure to obtain any licenses, permits or property rights or any required extensions; challenges to the issuance of licenses, permits or property rights, whether successful or unsuccessful; changes to the terms of licenses, permits or property rights; or a failure to comply with the terms of any licenses, permits or property rights that have been obtained could have a material adverse effect on our business by delaying, preventing or making future mining and processing at our Rodeo or Velarde\u00f1a properties and other continued processing activities economically unfeasible.\nLack of infrastructure could forestall or prevent further exploration and advancement.\nExploration activities, as well as any advancement activities, depend on adequate infrastructure. Reliable roads, bridges, power sources and water supply are important factors that affect capital and operating costs and the feasibility and economic viability of a project. Unanticipated or higher than expected costs and unusual or infrequent weather phenomena, or government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur exploration activities are in countries with developing economies and are subject to the risks of political and economic instability associated with these countries.\nWe currently conduct exploration activities almost exclusively in countries with developing economies, including Argentina and Mexico. These countries and other emerging markets in which we may conduct business have from time to time experienced economic or political instability. We may be materially adversely affected by risks associated with conducting exploration activities in countries with developing economies, including:\n\u25cfpolitical instability and violence;\n\u25cfwar and civil disturbance;\n\u25cfexpropriation or nationalization;\n\u25cfchanging fiscal, royalty and tax regimes;\n\u25cffluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u25cfhigh rates of inflation;\n\u25cfuncertain or changing legal requirements respecting the ownership and maintenance of mineral properties, mines and mining activities, and inconsistent or arbitrary application of such legal requirements;\n\u25cfuncertain or changing economic and environmental policies of governmental authorities in Mexico or Argentina;\n\u25cfunderdeveloped industrial and economic infrastructure;\n\u25cfcorruption; and\n\u25cfunenforceability of contractual rights.\nChanges in mining or investment policies or shifts in the prevailing political climate in any of the countries in which we conduct exploration activities could adversely affect our business.\nWe conduct our business in countries that may be adversely affected by changes in the local government\u2019s policies toward or laws governing the mining industry.\nWe have exploration activities primarily in Mexico and Argentina. In these regions there exist uncertainties regarding future changes in applicable law related to mining and exploration. For instance, in January 2014, amendments to the Mexico federal corporate income tax law required titleholders of mining concessions to pay annually a 7.5% duty of their mining related profits and a 0.5% duty on revenues obtained from the sale of gold, silver and platinum that were effective March 2015. These additional duties applicable to Mexico mining concession titleholders will have a significant\nimpact on the annual costs applicable to our Rodeo and Velarde\u00f1a properties if we have mining related profits or significant revenues in the future.\nAdditionally, effective January 2015, the Argentina National Mining Code was amended, increasing the annual canon payment by approximately four times. In 2019 and 2020, our annual canon fees payable to the Argentine government was $36,000 and $22,000 respectively, and we expect to pay approximately $15,000 in 2021.\nIn addition to the risk of increased transaction costs, we do not maintain political risk insurance to cover losses that we may incur as a result of nationalization, expropriation or similar events in Mexico or Argentina where we explore or have mining and processing activities.\nRisk Factors related to our Common Stock\nOne of our stockholders owns a significant percentage of our common stock and could block decisions or transactions that could be beneficial to other stockholders.\nOne of our stockholders, The Sentient Group, through the Sentient executive funds (\u201cSentient\u201d), owns approximately 24% of our outstanding common stock. With this level of ownership, Sentient could exert significant control over us, including over the election of directors, changes in the size or the composition of the board of directors, and mergers and other business combinations involving us. Through greater control of the board of directors and increased voting power, including the potential to prevent a quorum at stockholders meetings, Sentient could control certain decisions, including decisions regarding qualification and appointment of officers, operations of the business including acquisition or disposition of our assets or purchases and sales of mining or exploration properties, dividend policy, and access to capital (including borrowing from third-party lenders and the issuance of equity or debt securities). Sentient\u2019s large share ownership will also make it difficult, if not impossible, for us to enter into a change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial for our other shareholders.\nThe existence of a significant number of warrants may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 16,728,846 warrants outstanding with a weighted average exercise price per share of $0.38. The existence of securities available for exercise and resale is referred to as an \u201coverhang,\u201d and, particularly if the warrants are \"in the money,\" the anticipation of potential sales could exert downward pressure on the market price of our common stock.\nFailure to meet the maintenance criteria of the NYSE American may result in the delisting of our common stock, which could result in lower trading volumes and liquidity, lower prices of our common shares and make it more difficult for us to raise capital.\nOur common stock is listed on the NYSE American LLC (the \u201cNYSE American\u201d), and we are subject to its continued listing requirements, including maintaining certain share prices and a minimum amount of stockholders\u2019 equity. On August 19, 2019, we received written notification (the \u201cNotice\u201d) from the NYSE American that were not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) of the NYSE American Company Guide (the \u201cCompany Guide\u201d). We are required to report a stockholders\u2019 equity of $6.0 million or more if we have reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years. The Notice noted that we reported a stockholders\u2019 equity of $4,380,000 as of June 30, 2019 and losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in each of its five most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2018. As a result, we became subject to the procedures and requirements of Section 1009 of the Company Guide and were required to submit a plan of compliance by September 18, 2019 to the NYSE American addressing how we intended to regain compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) of the Company Guide by February 19, 2021. On January 14, 2021, we received notice from the NYSE American that we had resolved the continued listing deficiency with respect to Section\n1003(a)(iii) of the Company Guide and had regained compliance with all of the NYSE American continued listing requirements.\nIf we are unable to remain in compliance with the NYSE American continued listing requirements, our common stock may be suspended from trading on and/or delisted from the NYSE American. Although we have not been notified of any delisting proceedings, there is no assurance that we will not receive such notice in the future or that we will be able to then comply with NYSE American listing standards. If we are delisted from the NYSE American, it may have an adverse impact on our share price and may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future. In particular, if we are delisted from the NYSE American, we will be unable to sell our common stock pursuant to the ATM Program.\nIf our common stock were delisted and determined to be a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d a broker-dealer could find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock in the secondary market.\nIf our common stock were removed from listing on the NYSE American, it may be subject to the so-called \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. The SEC has adopted regulations that define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price per share of less than $5.00, subject to certain exceptions, such as any securities listed on a national securities exchange. For any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d unless exempt, the rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers, subject to certain exceptions. If our common stock were delisted and determined to be a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock on the secondary market. These factors could significantly negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur operations may be further disrupted, and our financial results may be adversely affected by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\nThe December 2019 novel strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, poses a risk to our business and operations. If a significant portion of our workforce becomes unable to work or travel to our operations due to illness or state or federal government restrictions (including travel restrictions and \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d and similar orders restricting certain activities that may be issued or extended by authorities), we may be forced to reduce or suspend exploration activities and/or development projects which may impact liquidity and financial results. For example, in compliance with a directive of the Mexican Federal Government to suspend all non-essential activities, including mining, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we suspended processing activities at the Velarde\u00f1a Properties in the State of Durango, Mexico, during portions of April and May 2020. If the Mexican Federal Government were to resuspend non-essential activities, including mining, this may significantly lower the revenue we expect to receive from production at our Rodeo property.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results as discussed above, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, such as those relating to our operation and indebtedness and financing. Because of the highly uncertain and dynamic nature of events relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is not currently possible to estimate the impact of the pandemic on our business. However, these effects could have a material impact on our operations, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely.\nWe depend on the services of key executives.\nOur business strategy is based on leveraging the experience and skill of our management team. We are dependent on the services of key executives, including Warren Rehn and Robert Vogels. If one or both of these executives were to\ncease serving the company in their role, we would need to immediately undertake a search for a replacement. During any such interim period, our ability to continue achieving our business objectives would be impaired.\nWe compete against larger and more experienced companies.\nThe mining industry is intensely competitive. Many large mining companies are primarily makers of precious or base metals and may become interested in the types of deposits on which we are focused, which include silver, gold and other precious metals deposits or polymetallic deposits containing significant quantities of base metals, including zinc, lead and copper. Many of these companies have greater financial resources, experience and technical capabilities than we do. We may encounter increasing competition from other mining companies in our efforts to acquire mineral properties and hire experienced mining professionals. Increased competition in our business could adversely affect our ability to attract necessary capital funding or acquire suitable mining properties or prospects for mineral exploration in the future.\nWe are dependent on information technology systems, which are subject to certain risks, including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks.\nWe are dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of our business. Any significant breakdown, invasion, virus, cyber attack, security breach, destruction or interruption of these systems by employees, others with authorized access to our systems, or unauthorized persons could negatively impact our business. To the extent any invasion, cyber attack or security breach results in disruption to our business, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, our data or confidential information, our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient. Although to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks, we may suffer such losses in the future. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures. We also may be subject to significant litigation, regulatory investigation and remediation costs associated with any information security vulnerabilities, cyber attacks or security breaches.", "PERMNO": 93285, "SIC": 1040, "TIC": "AUMN"}
