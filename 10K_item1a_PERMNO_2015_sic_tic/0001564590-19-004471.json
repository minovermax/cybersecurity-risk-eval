{"cik": "1096376", "company": "NUTRI SYSTEM INC /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should consider carefully the following risks and uncertainties when reading this Annual Report. If any of the events described below actually occurs, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.\nBecause the Exchange Ratio is fixed and the market price of Tivity Health common stock has fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate, you cannot be sure of the value of the Merger Consideration our stockholders will receive.\nUpon completion of the Merger, each share of Nutrisystem common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger (other than those held by Nutrisystem as treasury stock, by Tivity Health or by any subsidiary of Nutrisystem or Tivity Health or with respect to which appraisal rights have been properly exercised in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware) will be converted into the right to receive $38.75 in cash, without interest, and 0.2141 of a share of Tivity Health common stock. Because the Exchange Ratio is fixed, except for the potential adjustment described under \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Merger Consideration\u201d in the proxy statement we filed on February 4, 2019, the value of the stock portion of the Merger Consideration will depend on the market price of Tivity Health common stock at the time the Merger is completed. The value of the stock portion of the Merger Consideration has fluctuated since the date of the announcement of the Merger Agreement and will continue to fluctuate from the date hereof to the date of the Nutrisystem special meeting and the date the Merger is completed and thereafter. For example, on December 7, 2018, the last trading day before the public announcement of the Merger, the closing price of Tivity Health common stock on Nasdaq was $40.61; on December 10, 2018, the trading day on which the public announcement of the Merger took place, the closing price of Tivity Health common stock on Nasdaq was $27.65, and on February 20, 2019, the most recent practicable trading day prior to the date of this annual report, the closing price of Tivity Health common stock on Nasdaq was $22.38. Accordingly, at the time of the Nutrisystem special meeting, Nutrisystem stockholders will not know or be able to determine the market value of the Merger Consideration they would receive upon completion of the Merger. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including, among others, general market and economic conditions, changes in Tivity Health\u2019s and Nutrisystem\u2019s respective businesses, operations and prospects, market assessments of the strategic and operational aspects of the Merger and market assessments of the likelihood that the Merger will be completed, the timing of the Merger and other factors. Many of these factors are beyond Tivity Health\u2019s and Nutrisystem\u2019s control.\nOur business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the Merger.\nParties with which we do business may experience uncertainty associated with the transaction, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us. Our business relationships may be subject to disruption as customers, suppliers and others may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than Nutrisystem. These disruptions could have an adverse effect on the businesses, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of Nutrisystem. The adverse effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.\nThe Merger Agreement limits our ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for us to sell our business to a party other than Tivity Health. These provisions include a general prohibition on our soliciting any acquisition proposal or offer for a competing transaction. Further, there are only limited exceptions to the agreement that our Board of Directors will not withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Tivity Health the recommendation of our Board of Directors in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and Tivity Health generally has a right to match any competing acquisition proposals that may be made.\nHowever, at any time prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders, our Board of Directors is permitted to take certain of these actions and, in certain circumstances, terminate the Merger Agreement if it determines in good faith that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. Doing so could in certain circumstances obligate us to pay to Tivity Health a termination fee of $45.0 million.\nWhile we believe these provisions are reasonable and not preclusive of other offers, the provisions may discourage a third party that has an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of Nutrisystem from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if that party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per-share value than the currently proposed Merger Consideration. Furthermore, the termination fee may result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower per-share price to acquire Nutrisystem than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the $45.0 million termination fee that may become payable by us in certain circumstances.\nFailure to complete the Merger could negatively impact our stock price and the future business and financial results.\nIf the Merger is not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Merger, we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our stock price, and from our customers, suppliers, regulators and employees;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to pay Tivity Health a termination fee of $45.0 million if the Merger is terminated under certain circumstances;\n\u2022\nwe will be required to pay certain costs relating to the Merger, whether or not the Merger is completed; and\n\u2022\nmatters relating to the Merger (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us as an independent company.\nThere can be no assurance that the risks described above will not materialize. If any of those risks materialize, they may adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, financial results and stock price.\nIn addition, we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against Tivity Health or us to perform their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement. If the Merger is not completed, these risks may materialize and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, financial results and stock price.\nLawsuits have been filed and other lawsuits may be filed against Nutrisystem, Tivity Health and their respective boards of directors challenging the Merger. An adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may prevent the Merger from being completed.\nAs of February 20, 2019, six putative class action complaints have been filed by purported Nutrisystem stockholders challenging the Merger in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. The complaints are captioned Klein v. Nutrisystem, Inc. et al., Docket No. 1:19-cv-00056 (filed January 9, 2019), Shaev v. Nutrisystem, Inc. et al., Docket No. 1:19-cv-00063 (filed January 10, 2019), Vladimir Gusinsky Rev. Trust v. Nutrisystem, Inc., Docket No. 1:19-cv-00069 (filed January 10, 2019), Frechter v. Nutrisystem, Inc., et al., Docket No. 1:19-cv-00087 (filed January 16, 2019), Walton v. Nutrisystem, Inc. et al., Docket No. 1:19-cv-00112 (filed January 19, 2019), and Haines v. Nutrisystem, Inc., et al., Docket No. 1:19-cv-00137 (filed January 24, 2019). The complaints name as defendants each member of our Board of Directors and Nutrisystem itself and, in the case of the Klein and Gusinsky complaints, Tivity Health and Sweet Acquisition, Inc. The complaints allege, among other things, that statements made in the registration statement filed by Tivity Health on January 7, 2019 were materially incomplete and misleading and violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. In addition, the complaints generally allege that the Merger undervalues Nutrisystem, that the process leading up to the execution of the Merger Agreement was flawed, and that certain provisions of the Merger Agreement improperly favor Tivity Health and improperly impede a potential alternative transaction. Among other remedies, the complaints seek equitable relief rescinding the Merger Agreement and enjoining the defendants from completing the Merger, as well as recovery of litigation costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. Nutrisystem believes that the claims asserted in the actions are without merit and no supplemental disclosure is required under applicable law. However, in order to avoid the risk of adverse effect or delay in connection with these actions and to minimize the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, Nutrisystem voluntarily supplemented its proxy statement as described in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 22, 2019, and the plaintiffs in these actions have agreed to voluntarily dismiss their lawsuits in light of this supplemental disclosure.\nOne of the conditions to completion of the Merger is the absence of any law enacted, adopted or promulgated in the United States following December 9, 2018 or order that prohibits, renders illegal or enjoins the consummation of the Merger. Accordingly, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an order prohibiting completion of the Merger, then such order may prevent the Merger from being completed, or from being completed within the expected timeframe.\nThe closing of the Merger may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which Nutrisystem is a party.\nThe closing of the Merger may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which Nutrisystem is a party. If we are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements, potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages. Even if we are able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to Nutrisystem or the combined business.\nOur future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing expenditures and our ability to select effective markets and media in which to advertise.\nOur marketing expenditures were $203.2 million, $198.9 million and $152.4 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing expenditures, including our ability to:\n\u2022\ncreate greater awareness of our brands and our programs;\n\u2022\nidentify the most effective and efficient levels of spending in each market, media and specific media vehicle;\n\u2022\ndetermine the appropriate creative messages and media mix for advertising, marketing and promotional expenditures;\n\u2022\neffectively manage marketing costs (including creative and media) in order to maintain acceptable customer acquisition costs;\n\u2022\nacquire cost-effective national television advertising;\n\u2022\nselect the most effective markets, media and specific media vehicles in which to advertise; and\n\u2022\nconvert consumer inquiries into actual orders.\nOur planned marketing expenditures may not result in increased revenue or generate sufficient levels of brand name and program awareness. We may not be able to manage our marketing expenditures on a cost-effective basis whereby our customer acquisition costs may exceed the contribution profit generated from each additional customer.\nOur sales may be adversely impacted by the health and stability of the general economy.\nUnfavorable changes in general economic conditions, such as a recession or prolonged economic slowdown, may reduce the demand for our products and otherwise adversely affect our sales. For example, economic forces, including general economic conditions, demographic trends, consumer confidence in the economy, changes in disposable consumer income and/or reductions in discretionary spending, may cause consumers to defer purchases of our programs which could adversely affect our revenue, gross margins, and/or our overall financial condition and operating results.\nWe rely on third parties to provide us with adequate food supply, freight and fulfillment and Internet and networking services, the loss of any of which could cause our revenue, earnings or reputation to suffer.\nFood Manufacturers and Other Suppliers. We rely solely on third-party manufacturers to supply all of the food and other products we sell as well as packaging materials. In 2018, approximately 10% and 6% of inventory purchases were from two vendors. If we are unable to obtain sufficient quantity, quality and variety of food, other products and packaging materials in a timely and low-cost manner from our manufacturers, we will be unable to fulfill our customers\u2019 orders in a timely manner, which may cause us to lose revenue and market share or incur higher costs, as well as damage the value of our brands.\nFreight and Fulfillment. In 2018, 100% of our order fulfillment was handled by one third-party provider. Also, more than 97% of our direct to consumer orders were shipped by one third-party provider and more than 97% of our orders for retail programs were shipped by another third-party provider. Should these providers be unable to service our needs for even a short duration, our revenue and business could be harmed. Additionally, the cost and time associated with replacing these providers on short notice would add to our costs. Any replacement fulfillment provider would also require startup time, which could cause us to lose sales and market share.\nInternet and Networking. Our business also depends on a number of third parties for Internet access and networking, and we have limited control over these third parties. Should our network connections go down, our ability to fulfill orders would be delayed. Further, if our websites or call center become unavailable for a noticeable period of time due to Internet or communication failures, our business could be adversely affected, including harm to our brands and loss of sales.\nTherefore, we are dependent on maintaining good relationships with these third parties. The services we require from these parties may be disrupted by a number of factors associated with their businesses, including the following:\n\u2022\nlabor disruptions;\n\u2022\ndelivery problems;\n\u2022\nfinancial condition or results of operations;\n\u2022\ninternal inefficiencies;\n\u2022\nequipment failure;\n\u2022\nsevere weather;\n\u2022\nfire;\n\u2022\nnatural or man-made disasters; and\n\u2022\nwith respect to our food suppliers, shortages of ingredients or USDA or United States Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) compliance issues.\nWe may be subject to claims that our personnel are unqualified to provide proper weight loss advice.\nWe offer counseling options from weight loss counselors, registered dietitians and certified diabetes educators with varying levels of training. We may be subject to claims from our customers alleging that our personnel lack the qualifications necessary to provide proper advice regarding weight loss and related topics. We may also be subject to claims that our personnel have provided inappropriate advice or have inappropriately referred or failed to refer customers to health care providers for matters other than weight loss. Such claims could result in lawsuits, damage to our reputation and divert management\u2019s attention from our business, which would adversely affect our business.\nWe may be subject to health or advertising related claims from our customers.\nOur weight loss programs do not include medical treatment or medical advice, and we do not engage physicians or nurses to monitor the progress of our customers. Many people who are overweight suffer from other physical conditions, and our target consumers could be considered a high-risk population. A customer who experiences health problems could allege or bring a lawsuit against us on the basis that those problems were caused or worsened by participating in our weight management programs or by consuming one or more of our individual products. For example, our predecessor businesses suffered substantial losses due to health-related claims and related publicity. Further, customers who allege that they were deceived by any statements that we made in advertising or labeling could bring a lawsuit against us under consumer protection laws. Currently, we are neither subject to any such allegations nor have we been named in any such litigation. If we were subject to any such claims, while we would defend ourselves against such claims, we may ultimately be unsuccessful in our defense. Also, defending ourselves against such claims, regardless of their merit and ultimate outcome, would likely be lengthy and costly, and adversely affect our results of operations. Further, our general liability insurance may not cover claims of these types.\nThe weight management industry is highly competitive. If any of our competitors or a new entrant into the market with significant resources pursues a weight management program similar to ours, our business could be significantly affected.\nCompetition is intense in the weight management industry and we must remain competitive in the areas of program efficacy, price, taste, customer service and brand recognition. Our competitors include companies selling pharmaceutical products and weight loss programs, digital tools and wearable trackers, as well as a wide variety of diet foods and meal replacement bars and shakes, appetite suppressants and nutritional supplements. Some of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater resources. Our business could be adversely affected if someone with significant resources decided to imitate our weight management programs. For example, if a major supplier of pre-packaged foods decided to enter this market and made a substantial investment of resources in advertising and training diet counselors, our business could be significantly affected. Any increased competition from new entrants into our industry or any increased success by existing competition could result in reductions in our sales or prices, or both, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on certain third-party agreements for a percentage of revenue.\nWe have contractual agreements with certain third-party retailers. Under the agreements, these third parties control when and how often our products are offered and we are not guaranteed any minimum level of sales. If any third party elects not to renew their agreement with us or reduces the promotion of our products, our revenue will suffer. In addition, our third-party retailers may decide to stop selling our products upon written notice, which may result in an increased level of reclamation claims. In the event any retailer terminates its relationship with us and the level of reclamation claims exceeds the estimated amount reserved on our balance sheet at the time of sale to the retailer, we will have to record an expense for the excess claims, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, in certain instances, we could be prohibited from selling our products through competitors of these third parties for a specified time after the termination of the agreements.\nNew weight loss products or services may put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOn an ongoing basis, many existing and potential providers of weight loss solutions, including many pharmaceutical firms with significantly greater financial and operating resources than we have, are developing new products and services. The creation of a weight loss solution, such as a drug therapy, that is perceived to be safe, effective and \u201ceasier\u201d than a portion-controlled meal plan would put us at a disadvantage in the marketplace and our results of operations could be negatively affected.\nWe may be subject to litigation from our competitors.\nOur competitors may pursue litigation against us based on our advertising or other marketing practices regardless of its merit and chances of success, especially if we engage in comparative advertising, which includes advertising that directly or indirectly mentions a competitor or a competitor\u2019s weight loss program in comparison to our programs. While we would defend ourselves against any such claims, our defense may ultimately be unsuccessful. Also, defending against such claims, regardless of their merit and ultimate outcome, may be lengthy and costly, strain our resources and divert management\u2019s attention from their core responsibilities, which would have a negative impact on our business.\nOur business is subject to online security risks, including security breaches and identity theft.\nUnauthorized users who penetrate our information security could misappropriate proprietary or customer information or data or cause interruptions to the product offerings on our websites. As a result, it may become necessary to expend significant additional amounts of capital and resources to protect against, or to alleviate, problems caused by unauthorized users. These expenditures, however, may not prove to be a timely remedy against unauthorized users who are able to penetrate our information security. In addition to purposeful security breaches, the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could adversely affect our computer systems and, in turn, harm our business.\nA significant number of states require that customers be notified if a security breach results in the disclosure of their personal financial account or other information. Additional states and governmental entities are considering such \u201cnotice\u201d laws. In addition, other public disclosure laws may require that material security breaches be reported. If we experience a security breach and such notice or public disclosure is required in the future, our reputation and our business may be harmed.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and utilize proprietary and customer information and data. Privacy concerns among prospective and existing customers regarding our use of such information or data collected on our websites or through our services and products, such as weight management information, financial data, email addresses and home addresses, could keep them from using our websites or purchasing our services or products. We currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information and data. Businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for their use and handling of such information and data. Currently, a significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their credit cards directly for fees charged by us. We rely on third-party software products to secure our credit card transactions. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent payment transactions and other security breaches, failure to prevent or mitigate such fraud or breaches or changes in industry standards or regulations may adversely affect our business and operating results or cause us to lose our ability to accept credit cards as a form of payment and result in chargebacks of the fraudulently charged amounts. Furthermore, widespread credit card fraud may lessen our customers\u2019 willingness to purchase our products on our websites.\nWe may experience fluctuations in our operating results which may cause our stock price to be volatile.\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations. Our business is seasonal, with revenue generally greatest in the first calendar quarter and weakest in the fourth quarter. The market price of our common stock is subject to fluctuations in response to our operating results, general trends in the weight loss industry, announcements by our competitors, our ability to meet or exceed securities analysts\u2019 expectations, recommendations by securities analysts, the condition of the financial markets and other factors. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and cause it to fluctuate significantly.\nAcquisitions and the pursuit of new business opportunities present risks, and we may be unable to achieve the financial and strategic goals of any acquisition or new business.\nA component of our growth strategy has been and may continue to be to acquire existing businesses or pursue other business opportunities in the market for weight management and fitness products and other complimentary products and services. These types of transactions will face a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating newly acquired or newly started businesses into existing operations, which may result in increasing operating costs that would adversely affect our operating income and earnings;\n\u2022\nthe risk that our current and planned facilities, information systems, personnel and controls will not be adequate to support our future operations;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management time and capital resources from our existing businesses, which could adversely affect their performance and our operating results;\n\u2022\ndependence on key management personnel of acquired or newly started businesses and the risk that we will be unable to integrate or retain such personnel;\n\u2022\nthe risk that the new products or services we may introduce or begin offering, whether as a result of internal expansion or business acquisitions, will not gain acceptance among consumers and existing customers;\n\u2022\nthe risk that new efforts may have a detrimental effect on our brands;\n\u2022\nthe risk that we will face competition from established or larger competitors in the new markets we may enter, which could adversely affect the financial performance of any businesses we might acquire or start; and\n\u2022\nthe risk that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or of the commencement of any new business may not be realized, in which event we will not be able to achieve any return on our investment in that new business.\nConsummating these transactions could also result in the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense, as well as unforeseen contingent liabilities, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may also issue additional equity in connection with these transactions, which would dilute our existing stockholders.\nWe have and expect to continue to launch new weight loss programs and brands which may not be successful due to the failure of such programs or brands to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere are a number of risks inherent in any new program or brand introduction, which could prevent us from achieving revenue growth and increasing our overall market share in the commercial weight loss market. Any new program or brand may fail to achieve the anticipated level of market acceptance or appeal to consumer tastes and preferences. In addition, introduction costs, including product testing and marketing, may be greater than anticipated. If the new program or brand is not successful or falls short of anticipated market acceptance, we may be adversely affected by continued expenses and the diversion of management time to this initiative. Any or all of such events could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we do not continue to receive referrals from existing customers, our customer acquisition cost may increase.\nWe rely on word-of-mouth advertising for a portion of our new customers. If our brands suffer or the number of customers acquired through referrals drops due to other circumstances, our costs associated with acquiring new customers and generating revenue will increase, which will, in turn, have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nWe use third-party marketing vendors to promote our products. If the spokespersons affiliated with the third-party marketing vendors suffer adverse publicity or elect to not renew, our revenue could be adversely affected.\nOur marketing strategy depends in part on celebrity spokespersons, as well as customer spokespersons, to promote our weight loss programs. Any of these spokespersons may become the subject of adverse news reports, negative publicity or otherwise be alienated from a segment of our customer base, whether weight loss related or not. If so, such events may reduce the effectiveness of his or her endorsement and, in turn, adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. Additionally, if a spokesperson elects not to renew their agreement with us, our revenue may suffer.\nThird parties may infringe on our brands, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, which may have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe currently rely on a combination of trademark and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures to establish and protect our proprietary rights, including our brands. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, the value of our brands, services and products could be diminished and our business may suffer. Our precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. Any legal action that we may bring to protect our brands and other intellectual property could be unsuccessful and expensive and could divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. In addition, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property, especially in Internet-related businesses, are uncertain and evolving. We cannot assure you that these evolving legal standards will sufficiently protect our intellectual property rights in the future.\nWe may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims.\nThird parties may in the future make claims against us alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property claims, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could significantly divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. In addition, if we were unable to successfully defend against such claims, we may have to pay damages, stop selling the service or product or stop using the software, technology or content found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights, seek a license for the infringing service, product, software, technology or content or develop alternative non-infringing services, products, software, technology or content. If we cannot license on reasonable terms, develop alternatives or stop using the service, product, software, technology or content for any infringing aspects of our business, we may be forced to limit our service and product offerings. Any of these results could reduce our revenue and our ability to compete effectively, increase our costs or harm our business.\nOur credit agreement contains financial and other covenants. The failure to comply with such covenants could have an adverse effect on us.\nOur credit agreement contains certain financial and other covenants including a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (applicable if there are outstanding borrowings), and limitations on, among other things, liens, indebtedness, certain acquisitions, consolidations and sales of assets. There were no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2018. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of the credit agreement may result in an event of default under the agreement.\nWe are dependent on our key executive officers for future success. If we lose the services of any of our key executive officers and we are unable to timely retain a qualified replacement, our business could be harmed.\nOur future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of our key executive officers. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could harm our business. If any key executive officers left us or were seriously injured and became unable to work, our business could be harmed.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation may deter or delay an acquisition of us or prevent a change in control, even if an acquisition or a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation (as amended) may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of us, even if our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.\nOur certificate of incorporation (as amended) permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval upon such terms as the Board of Directors may determine. The rights of the holders of our common stock will be junior to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring, a majority of our outstanding common stock. The issuance of a substantial number of preferred shares could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nChanges in consumer preferences could negatively impact our operating results.\nOur programs feature frozen and ready-to-go food selections, which we believe offer convenience and value to our customers. Our continued success depends, to a large degree, upon the continued popularity of our programs versus various other weight loss, weight management and fitness regimens, such as low carbohydrate diets, appetite suppressants and diets featured in the published media. Changes in consumer tastes and preferences away from our frozen or ready-to-go food and support and counseling services, and any\nfailure to provide innovative responses to these changes, may have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur success is also dependent on our food innovation including maintaining a robust array of food items and improving the quality of existing items. If we do not continually expand our food items or provide customers with items that are desirable in taste and quality, our business could be harmed.\nThe weight loss industry is subject to adverse publicity, which could harm our business.\nThe weight loss industry receives adverse publicity from time to time, and the occurrence of such publicity could harm us, even if the adverse publicity is not directly related to us. In the early 1990s, our predecessor businesses were subject to extremely damaging adverse publicity relating to a large number of lawsuits alleging that the Nutrisystem\u00ae weight loss program in use at that time led to gall bladder disease. This publicity was a factor that contributed to the bankruptcy of our predecessor businesses in 1993. In addition, our predecessor businesses were severely impacted by significant litigation and damaging publicity related to their customers\u2019 use of fen-phen as an appetite suppressant, which the FDA ordered withdrawn from the market in September 1997. The significant decline in business resulting from the fen-phen problems caused our predecessor businesses to close all of their company-owned weight loss centers.\nCongressional hearings about practices in the weight loss industry have also resulted in adverse publicity and a consequent decline in the revenue of weight loss businesses. Future research reports or publicity that is perceived as unfavorable or that question certain weight loss programs, products or methods could result in a decline in our revenue. Because of our dependence on consumer perceptions, adverse publicity associated with illness or other undesirable effects resulting from the consumption of our products or similar products by competitors, whether or not accurate, could also damage customer confidence in our weight loss programs and result in a decline in revenue. Adverse publicity could arise even if the unfavorable effects associated with weight loss products or services resulted from the user\u2019s failure to use such products or services appropriately.\nOur industry is subject to governmental regulation that could increase in severity and hurt results of operations.\nOur industry is subject to federal, state and other governmental regulation. Certain federal and state agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d), regulate and enforce such laws relating to advertising, disclosures to consumers, privacy, consumer pricing and billing arrangements and other consumer protection matters. A determination by a federal or state agency, or a court, that any of our practices do not meet existing or new laws or regulations could result in liability, adverse publicity and restrictions on our business operations. Some advertising practices in the weight loss industry, in particular, have led to investigations from time to time by the FTC and other governmental agencies and many companies in the weight loss industry, including our predecessor businesses, have entered into consent decrees with the FTC relating to weight loss claims and other advertising practices. In addition, the FTC\u2019s Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising require us and other weight loss companies to use a statement as to what the typical weight loss a customer can expect to achieve on our programs when using a customer\u2019s weight loss testimonial in advertising. Federal and state regulation of advertising practices generally, and in the weight loss industry in particular, may increase in scope or severity in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOther aspects of our industry are also subject to government regulation. For example, the manufacturing, labeling and distribution of food products, including dietary supplements, are subject to strict USDA and FDA requirements and food manufacturers are subject to rigorous inspection and other requirements of the USDA and FDA, and companies operating in foreign markets must comply with those countries\u2019 requirements for proper labeling, controls on hygiene, food preparation and other matters. If federal, state, local or foreign regulation of our industry increases for any reason, then we may be required to incur significant expenses, as well as modify our operations to comply with new regulatory requirements, which could harm our operating results. Additionally, remedies available in any potential administrative or regulatory actions may include product recalls and requiring us to refund amounts paid by all affected customers or pay other damages, which could be substantial.\nLaws and regulations directly applicable to communications, operations or commerce over the Internet such as those governing intellectual property, privacy, libel and taxation, are becoming more prevalent and some remain unsettled. If we are required to comply with new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, or if we are unable to comply with these laws, regulations or interpretations, our business could be adversely affected.\nFuture laws or regulations, including laws or regulations affecting our marketing and advertising practices, relations with consumers, employees, service providers, or our services and products, may have an adverse impact on us.\nThe sale of ingested products involves product liability and other risks.\nLike other distributors of products that are ingested, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims if the use of our products results in illness or injury. The foods that we resell in the U.S. are subject to laws and regulations, including those administered by the USDA and FDA that establish manufacturing practices and quality standards for food products. Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business as existing insurance coverage may not be adequate. Distributors of weight loss food products, including dietary supplements, as well as our predecessor businesses, have been named as defendants in product liability lawsuits from time to time. The successful assertion or settlement of an uninsured claim, a significant number of insured claims or a claim exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage would harm us by adding costs to the business and by diverting the attention of senior management from the operation of the business. We may also be subject to claims that our products contain contaminants, are improperly labeled, include inadequate instructions as to use or inadequate warnings covering interactions with other substances. Product liability litigation, even if not meritorious, is very expensive and could also entail adverse publicity for us and reduce our revenue. In addition, the products we distribute, or certain components of those products, may be subject to product recalls or other deficiencies. Any negative publicity associated with these actions would adversely affect our brand and may result in decreased product sales and, as a result, lower revenue and profits.", "PERMNO": 88379, "SIC": 5961, "TIC": "NTRI"}
