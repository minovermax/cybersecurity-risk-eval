{"cik": "1126956", "company": "SPIRE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-11-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nSpire\u2019s and the Utilities\u2019 business and financial results are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth below. The risks described below are those the Company and the Utilities consider to be material. When considering any investment in Spire or the Utilities\u2019 securities, investors should carefully consider the following information, as well as information contained in the caption \u201cForward-Looking Statements,\u201d Item 7A, and other documents Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama file with the SEC. This list is not exhaustive, and Spire\u2019s and the Utilities\u2019 respective management places no priority or likelihood based on the risk descriptions, order of presentation or grouping by subsidiary. All references to dollar amounts are in millions.\nRISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT RELATE TO THE BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS OF SPIRE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nClimate change and regulatory and legislative developments in the energy industry related to climate change may in the future adversely affect operations and financial results.\nClimate change, and regulatory, public policy, or legislative changes to address the potential for climate change, could adversely affect operations and financial results of the Company. Management believes it is likely that any such resulting impacts would occur over a long period of time and thus would be difficult to quantify with any degree of specificity. To the extent climate change results in warmer temperatures, financial results could be adversely affected through lower gas volumes and revenues and reduced marketing opportunities. Another possible impact of climate change may be more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, which could increase costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to customers or result in lost revenues if the Company were unable to deliver natural gas to customers. Such weather events could also disrupt our usual gas supplies and make it impossible or extremely costly to find replacement gas for our customers. To the extent such impacts are not covered by insurance or recovered in rates, the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, there have been a number of federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives proposed in recent years in an attempt to control or limit the effects of global warming and overall climate change, including greenhouse gas emissions, such as methane and carbon dioxide. The adoption in the future of this type of legislation by Congress or similar legislation by states or localities, or the adoption of related regulations by federal, state or local governments mandating a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, restricting the use of fossil fuels, such as natural gas, or restricting the construction of infrastructure necessary to deliver natural gas to customers could have far-reaching and significant impacts on the energy industry. Such new legislation or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, affect the demand for natural gas or impact the prices charged to customers. At this time, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations that may be adopted on the Company\u2019s and the Utilities\u2019 future business, financial condition or financial results.\nFailing to secure a permanent re-authorization of the Spire STL Pipeline to operate could adversely affect the Company.\nOn June 22, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued an order vacating the Spire STL Pipeline\u2019s FERC certificates to operate and remanding the proceeding back to the FERC, which took effect on October 8, 2021. On September 14, 2021, and December 3, 2021, the FERC issued temporary certificates to allow the pipeline to continue operating indefinitely while it considers approval of a new permanent certificate.\nThe court decision to vacate the Spire STL Pipeline\u2019s Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity previously issued by the FERC in 2018 could, depending on the course of action the FERC takes, cause a temporary or permanent halt in the natural gas supply transported by the pipeline or result in new regulatory conditions imposed on the pipeline, any of which could adversely affect the Company (including Spire Missouri) and our customers.\nSpire Missouri relies on the Spire STL Pipeline to transport natural gas into the St. Louis region. In the event the pipeline is taken out of service or even as a result of regulatory uncertainty and business constraints associated with ongoing temporary authorization of the pipeline, Spire Missouri\u2019s customers, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted, which could result in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, as discussed under RISKS THAT RELATE TO THE GAS UTILITY SEGMENT below.\nIn addition, in the event the pipeline is taken out of service, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted by impairment of Spire STL Pipeline\u2019s assets, currently carried at over $270 million, and other effects. Spire STL Pipeline will continue to pursue all legal and regulatory avenues to ensure its continued and future operation.\nReductions in capacity of interconnecting, third-party pipelines could cause a reduction in volumes transported by the Spire STL Pipeline, which could adversely affect the Company.\nSpire STL Pipeline is dependent upon third-party pipelines and other facilities to provide delivery options to and from its pipeline. If any pipeline connection were to become unavailable for volumes of natural gas due to repairs, damage to the facility, lack of capacity or any other reason, Spire STL Pipeline\u2019s ability to continue shipping natural gas to end markets could be restricted, and to the extent not mitigated by contractual indemnification, insurance or tariffs, would thereby reduce its revenues. Any permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnect that causes a material reduction in volumes transported on its pipeline could result in an impairment loss that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a holding company, Spire depends on its operating subsidiaries to meet its financial obligations.\nSpire is a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of its operating subsidiaries and cash investments. Spire, and Spire Missouri prior to the holding company\u2019s formation in 2000, has paid common stock dividends continuously since 1946. Spire\u2019s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate sufficient net income and cash flows to pay upstream dividends and make loans or loan repayments. In addition, because it is a holding company and the substantial portion of its assets are represented by its holdings in the Utilities, the risks faced by the Utilities as described below under RISKS THAT RELATE TO THE GAS UTILITY SEGMENT may also adversely affect Spire\u2019s cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nA downgrade in Spire\u2019s and/or its subsidiaries\u2019 credit ratings may negatively affect its ability to access capital and its cost of capital.\nCurrently, Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama have investment grade credit ratings. There is no assurance that such credit ratings for any of the Spire companies will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in each rating agency\u2019s judgment, circumstances so warrant. Spire has a working capital line of credit to meet its short-term liquidity needs. Spire\u2019s line of credit may be used to meet the liquidity needs of any of its subsidiaries, subject to sublimits. If the rating agencies lowered the credit rating at any of these entities, particularly below investment grade, it might significantly limit that entity\u2019s ability to secure new or additional credit facilities and would increase its costs of borrowing. Spire\u2019s or the Utilities\u2019 ability to borrow under current or new credit facilities and costs of that borrowing have a direct impact on their ability to execute their operating strategies.\nPipeline integrity programs and repairs may impose significant costs and liabilities on the Company.\nThe U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) requires pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate their pipelines and to take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in areas where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm. PHMSA constantly updates its regulations to ensure the highest levels of pipeline safety. As the operator of pipelines, Spire is required to:\n\u2022\nperform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;\n\u2022\nidentify and characterize applicable threats to pipelines;\n\u2022\nimprove data collection, integration and analysis;\n\u2022\nrepair and remediate the pipeline as necessary; and\n\u2022\nimplement preventative and mitigating actions.\nThe Company is required to maintain pipeline integrity programs that are intended to assess pipeline integrity. Any repair, remediation, preventative or mitigating actions may require significant capital and operating expenditures. Should the Company fail to comply with applicable statutes and the PHMSA Office of Pipeline Safety\u2019s rules and related regulations and orders, it could be subject to significant penalties and fines.\nTransporting, distributing, and storing natural gas and propane involves numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\nNatural gas transportation, distribution and storage activities inherently involve a variety of hazards and operations risks, such as leaks, accidental explosions, damage caused by third parties, and mechanical problems, which could cause substantial financial losses. In addition, these risks could result in serious injury to employees and non-employees, loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of operations, and substantial losses to the Company and its subsidiaries. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. Similar risks also exist for Spire Missouri\u2019s propane storage, transmission and minor distribution operations. These activities may subject the Company to litigation or administrative proceedings. Such litigation or proceedings could result in substantial monetary judgments, fines, or penalties against the Company and its subsidiaries or be resolved on unfavorable terms. The Utilities and other Spire businesses are subject to federal and state laws and regulations requiring them to maintain certain safety and system integrity measures by identifying and managing storage and pipeline risks. Compliance with these laws and regulations, or future changes in these laws and regulations, may result in increased capital, operating and other costs which may not be recoverable in a timely manner from customers in rates. In accordance with customary industry practices, the Utilities and other Spire businesses maintain insurance against a significant portion, but not all, of these risks and losses. To the extent that the occurrence of any of these events is not fully covered by insurance, it could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries.\nIn connection with acquisitions, Spire and Spire Missouri recorded goodwill and long-lived assets that could become impaired and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nSpire and Spire Missouri assess goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company and Spire Missouri assess their long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that an asset\u2019s carrying amount may not be recoverable. To the extent the value of goodwill or long-lived assets becomes impaired, the Company and Spire Missouri may be required to incur impairment charges that could have a material impact on their results of operations.\nSince interest rates are a key component, among other assumptions, in the models used to estimate the fair values of the Company\u2019s reporting units, rises in interest rates would generally decrease the calculated fair values and future impairments may occur. Due to the subjectivity of the assumptions and estimates underlying the impairment analysis, Spire and Spire Missouri cannot provide assurance that future analyses will not result in impairment. These assumptions and estimates include projected cash flows, current and future rates for contracted capacity, growth rates, weighted average cost of capital and market multiples.\nChanges to income tax policy, certain tax elections, tax regulations and future taxable income could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company has significantly reduced its current federal and state income tax obligations over the past few years through tax planning strategies including the use of bonus depreciation deductions for certain expenditures for property. As a result, the Company has generated large annual taxable losses that have resulted in significant federal and state net operating losses. The Company plans to utilize these net operating losses in the future to reduce income tax obligations. The value of these net operating losses could be reduced if the Company cannot generate enough taxable income in the future to utilize all of the net operating losses generated prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 before they expire due to lower-than-expected financial performance or regulatory actions.\nChanges to income tax policy, laws and regulations, including but not limited to changes in tax rates, the deductibility of certain expenses including interest and state and local income taxes and/or changes in the deductibility of certain expenditures for property, could adversely impact the Company. Those impacts could include reducing the value of its net operating losses and could result in material charges to earnings. Further, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted. Notably, the Inflation Reduction Act became effective on August 16, 2022. This new law provides various credits and incentives with respect to clean energy. The Company is evaluating the impact and applicability of these programs to its operations, but they are not expected to have a material impact on the Company.\nSpire\u2019s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are subject to investment and interest rate risk that could negatively impact its financial condition.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries have pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide benefits to many of their employees and retirees. Costs of providing benefits and related funding requirements of these plans are subject to changes in the market value of the assets that fund the plans. The funded status of the plans and the related costs reflected in the Company\u2019s financial statements are affected by various factors, which are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, including economic conditions, financial market performance, interest rates, life expectancies and demographics. Recessions and volatility in the domestic and international financial markets have negatively affected the asset values of Spire\u2019s pension plans at various times in the past. Poor investment returns or lower interest rates may necessitate accelerated funding of the plans to meet minimum federal government requirements, which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 financial condition and results of operations. For more information, including regulatory provisions affecting the Utilities\u2019 plans, see Note 13, Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nThe Company\u2019s natural gas storage business includes inherent geologic and operational risks, as well as risks from competition and changes in market fundamentals.\nThe Company plans to continue to increase capacity, improve operating performance, and improve the integrity of its storage fields and associated above-ground facilities of Spire Storage. Construction of such assets is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including supply chain and labor disruptions, weather conditions during construction, equipment failures and construction quality issues. Any such disruptions, as well as any negative effects from the risks discussed below, could result in an impairment of Spire's investment in the project, and such impairment could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nAny damage to the Spire Storage facilities or pipelines, or lack of integrity to its storage fields, including damages caused by a blow-out, to the extent not covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s storage assets are connected to third-party-owned pipelines. The continuing operation of such third-party pipelines is not within its control. If any of these pipelines become unable to transport, treat or process natural gas or natural gas liquids, or if the volumes it gathers or transports do not meet the quality requirements of such pipelines, the Company\u2019s revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nThe Company does not own all the land on which its storage facilities were constructed, and it is, therefore, subject to the possibility of more onerous terms or increased costs to retain necessary land use, if and when applicable property rights expire or are renewed. Changes in the terms of such land use could have an adverse impact on the financial condition and results of operations of the Company\u2019s storage business.\nSpire Storage is subject to competition from similar services provided by pipelines and from competing independent storage providers capable of serving its customers. Natural gas storage is a competitive business, with competitors having the ability to expand storage capacity. Increased competition in the natural gas storage business could reduce the demand and drive rates down for the Company\u2019s natural gas storage services.\nStorage businesses are affected by various gas market fundamentals which impact the level of demand for storage services and the rates that can be charged for these services. These market fundamentals include: seasonal price spread; monthly, daily and hourly price volatility; locational basis for pricing points on pipelines connected to a storage facility; seasonal, daily and hourly weather; and operational impacts in supply and market areas served by a storage facility and its connected pipelines. These fundamentals have varying and potentially material adverse impacts on the various services offered by storage facilities and the rates that can be charged for these services in the market. These services include long-term firm storage, short-term park and loan, wheeling, and optimization. Rates below the variable costs to operate a storage facility could result in a decision to not operate all the capacity in the facility or to operate the facility at a loss if required to fulfill firm customer contract obligations. A sustained decline in these rates or a shut-in of all or a portion of one or more facilities\u2019 capacity could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS THAT RELATE TO THE GAS UTILITY SEGMENT\nRegulation of the Utilities\u2019 businesses may impact rates they are able to charge, costs, and profitability.\nThe Utilities are subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities. At the state level, the Utilities are regulated in Missouri by the Missouri Public Service Commission (MoPSC), in Alabama by the Alabama Public Service Commission (APSC), and in Mississippi by the Mississippi Public Service Commission (MSPSC). These state public service commissions regulate many aspects of the Utilities\u2019 distribution operations, including construction and maintenance of facilities, operations, safety, the rates the Utilities may charge customers, the terms of service to their customers, transactions with their affiliates, the rate of return they are allowed to realize, and the accounting treatment for certain aspects of their operations. For further discussion of these accounting matters, see Regulatory Accounting under Critical Accounting Estimates in Item 7.\nAccounting for the economics of rate regulation affects multiple financial statement line items (such as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; operating revenues; and operating expenses) and affects multiple disclosures in the Company\u2019s financial statements. There is a risk that the state public service commissions will not approve full recovery of the costs of providing utility service or recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment. A material disallowance of deferred costs could adversely affect the Utilities\u2019 results of operations.\nThe MoPSC also approves Spire Missouri\u2019s Infrastructure System Replacement Surcharge (ISRS). The ISRS allows Spire Missouri expedited recovery for its investment to upgrade its infrastructure and enhance its safety and reliability without the necessity of a formal rate case. Such investments are subject to review, and there is risk that any material disallowance of costs under ISRS could adversely affect the timing of revenues and cash flows.\nThe Utilities\u2019 ability to obtain and timely implement rate increases and rate supplements to maintain the current rate of return is subject to regulatory review and approval. There can be no assurance that they will be able to obtain rate increases or rate supplements or continue earning the current authorized rates of return. Spire Alabama\u2019s and Spire Gulf\u2019s rate setting process, Rate Stabilization and Equalization (RSE), is subject to regulation by the APSC and is implemented pursuant to APSC orders expiring September 30, 2025. RSE adjustments would continue after that date unless the APSC enters an order to the contrary in a manner consistent with the law. Spire Mississippi is subject to regulation by the MSPSC and utilizes the Rate Stabilization Adjustment (RSA) Rider. For further details, see Note 15, Regulatory Matters, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nThe Utilities could incur additional costs if required to adjust to new laws or regulations, revisions to existing laws or regulations or changes in interpretations of existing laws or regulations. In addition, as the regulatory environment for the natural gas industry increases in complexity, the risk of inadvertent noncompliance could also increase. If the Utilities fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, whether existing or new, they could be subject to fines, penalties or other enforcement action by the authorities that regulate the Utilities\u2019 operations.\nSignificantly warmer-than-normal weather conditions, the effects of climate change, legislative and regulatory initiatives in response to climate change or in support of increased energy efficiency, and other factors that influence customer usage may affect the Utilities\u2019 sale of heating energy and adversely impact their financial position and results of operations.\nThe Utilities\u2019 earnings are primarily generated by the sale of heating energy. Spire Missouri and Spire Mississippi each have a Weather Normalization Adjustment rider, Spire Alabama has a Temperature Adjustment Rider, and Spire Gulf has a Weather Impact Normalization Factor. These mechanisms, approved by the respective state regulatory body, provide better assurance of the recovery of fixed costs and margins during winter months despite variations in sales volumes due to the impacts of weather, while the annual rate designs of Alabama and Mississippi help adjust for other factors that affect customer usage. However, significantly warmer-than-normal weather conditions in the Utilities\u2019 service areas and other factors, such as climate change, alternative energy sources and increased efficiency of gas furnaces and other appliances, may result in reduced profitability and decreased cash flows attributable to lower gas sales. Furthermore, continuation of these adjustment factors is subject to regulatory discretion.\nIn addition, legislative and regulatory initiatives by the federal, state and local governments addressing greenhouse gas emissions or restricting the use of natural gas could adversely affect customer demand. The promulgation of regulations of the emissions of greenhouse gases and efficiency for residential gas furnaces and other gas appliances or the potential enactment of congressional legislation addressing global warming and climate change may decrease customer usage, encourage fuel switching from gas to other energy forms, and may result in future additional compliance costs that could impact the Utilities\u2019 financial conditions and results of operations.\nThe Utilities\u2019 ability to meet their customers\u2019 natural gas requirements may be impaired if contracted gas supplies, interstate pipeline and/or storage services are not available or delivered in a timely manner.\nIn order to meet their customers\u2019 annual and seasonal natural gas demands, the Utilities must obtain sufficient supplies, interstate pipeline capacity, and storage capacity. If they are unable to obtain these, either from their suppliers\u2019 inability to deliver the contracted commodity or the inability to secure replacement quantities, to the extent not mitigated by tariffs, contractual indemnification or insurance, the Utilities\u2019 financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted. If a substantial disruption in interstate natural gas pipelines\u2019 transmission and storage capacity were to occur during periods of heavy demand, the Utilities\u2019 financial results could be adversely impacted.\nIn particular, the natural gas supply provided to Spire Missouri by Spire STL Pipeline is at risk due to the order issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacating the Spire STL Pipeline\u2019s Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity previously issued by the FERC and remanding the matter back to the FERC for further action. The STL Pipeline is currently operating under temporary certificates. In the event this pipeline is taken out of service, either temporarily or permanently, Spire Missouri\u2019s ability to secure new pipeline contracts on other systems serving the region may be significantly constrained, and Spire Missouri would not be able to replace that supply based on similar terms or at all over the short term based on current market and operating conditions. In the event that the Spire STL Pipeline is unavailable and an extreme weather event occurs, Spire Missouri would face heightened risks, including service outages and other disruptions; the need for service restoration, creating hazards for Spire Missouri, its employees, and its customers; the potential for loss of life and property in its service territory; and associated exposure to litigation or administrative proceedings. If this pipeline is taken out of service, Spire Missouri may need to design, construct, and place in service new facilities or modify existing facilities in order to receive gas from alternate sources, giving rise to additional regulatory and business risks and hazards.\nSpire Missouri will continue to pursue all legal and regulatory avenues to ensure access to reliable, affordable and safe delivery of energy for eastern Missouri. If Spire Missouri is unable to obtain sufficient pipeline capacity to meet its customers\u2019 annual and seasonal natural gas demands, Spire Missouri\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted which could result in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Utilities are involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental bodies that could adversely affect their results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Utilities are involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental bodies with respect to general claims, rates, environmental issues, gas cost prudence reviews and other matters. For further details, see Contingencies in Note 16 to the financial statements in Item 8. Adverse decisions regarding these matters, to the extent they require the Utilities to make payments in excess of amounts provided for in their financial statements, or to the extent they are not covered by insurance, could adversely affect the Utilities\u2019 results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Utilities\u2019 liquidity may be adversely affected by delays in recovery of their costs, due to regulation.\nIn the normal course of business, there is a lag between when the Utilities incur increases in certain of their costs and the time in which those costs are considered for recovery in the ratemaking process. Cash requirements for increased operating costs, increased funding levels of defined benefit pension and postretirement costs, capital expenditures, and other increases in the costs of doing business can require outlays of cash prior to the authorization of increases in rates charged to customers, as approved by the MoPSC, APSC, and MSPSC. Accordingly, the Utilities\u2019 liquidity can be adversely impacted to the extent higher costs are not timely recovered from their customers.\nThe Utilities\u2019 liquidity and, in certain circumstances, the Utilities\u2019 results of operations may be adversely affected by the cost of purchasing natural gas during periods in which natural gas prices are rising significantly.\nThe tariff rate schedules of Spire Missouri, Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi contain Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) clauses and Spire Alabama\u2019s tariff rate schedule contains a Gas Supply Adjustment (GSA) rider that permit the Utilities to file for rate adjustments to recover the cost of purchased gas. Changes in the cost of purchased gas are flowed through to customers and may affect uncollectible amounts and cash flows and can therefore impact the amount of capital resources.\nCurrently, Spire Missouri is allowed to adjust the gas cost component of rates up to four times each year while Spire Alabama and Spire Gulf (collectively, the \u201cAlabama Utilities\u201d) and Spire Mississippi may adjust the gas cost component of their rates on a monthly basis. Spire Missouri must make a mandatory gas cost adjustment at the beginning of the winter, in November, and during the next twelve months may make up to three additional discretionary gas cost adjustments, so long as each of these adjustments is separated by at least two months.\nThe MoPSC typically approves the Spire Missouri PGA changes on an interim basis, subject to refund and the outcome of a subsequent audit and prudence review. Due to such review process, there is a risk of a disallowance of full recovery of these costs. Any material disallowance of purchased gas costs would adversely affect results of operations. The Alabama Utilities\u2019 gas supply charges are submitted for APSC review on a monthly basis, regardless of whether there is a request for a change, so prudence review occurs on an ongoing basis. Spire Mississippi\u2019s PGA is adjusted on a monthly basis for the most recent charges and is filed at the MSPSC on a monthly basis.\nIncreases in the prices the Utilities charge for gas may also adversely affect revenues because they could lead customers to reduce usage and cause some customers to have trouble paying the resulting higher bills. These higher prices may increase bad debt expenses and ultimately reduce earnings. Rapid increases in the price of purchased gas may result in an increase in short-term debt.\nTo lower financial exposure to commodity price fluctuations, Spire Missouri enters into contracts to hedge the forward commodity price of its natural gas supplies. As part of this strategy, Spire Missouri may use fixed-price forward physical purchase contracts, swaps, futures, and option contracts. However, Spire Missouri does not hedge the entire exposure of energy assets or positions to market price volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. Any costs, gains, or losses experienced through hedging procedures, including carrying costs, generally flow through the PGA clause, thereby limiting Spire Missouri\u2019s exposure to earnings volatility. However, variations in the timing of collections of such gas costs under the PGA clause and the effect of cash payments for margin deposits associated with Spire Missouri\u2019s use of natural gas derivative instruments may cause short-term cash requirements to vary. These procedures remain subject to prudence review by the MoPSC.\nOther than fixed-price forward physical purchase contracts, Spire Alabama, Spire Gulf, and Spire Mississippi currently do not utilize risk mitigation strategies that incorporate commodity hedge instruments, but Spire Alabama has the ability to do so through its GSA.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations may require significant expenditures or increase operating costs.\nThe Utilities are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of their present and future operations. These laws and regulations require the Utilities to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections, and approvals. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations and failure to obtain any required permits and licenses may result in costs to the Utilities in the form of fines, penalties or business interruptions, which may be material. In addition, existing environmental laws and regulations could be revised or reinterpreted and/or new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to the Utilities or their facilities, thereby impacting the Utilities\u2019 cost of compliance. The discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions, including former manufactured gas plant sites, and claims against the Utilities under environmental laws and regulations may result in expenditures and liabilities, which could be material. To the extent environmental compliance costs are not fully covered by insurance or recovered in rates from customers, those costs may have an adverse effect on the Utilities\u2019 financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Utilities\u2019 business activities are concentrated in three states.\nThe Utilities provide natural gas distribution services to customers in Alabama, Mississippi, and Missouri. Changes in the regional economies, politics, regulations and weather patterns of these states could negatively impact the Utilities\u2019 growth opportunities and the usage patterns and financial condition of customers and could adversely affect the Utilities\u2019 earnings, cash flows, and financial position.\nThe Utilities may be adversely affected by economic conditions.\nPeriods of slowed economic activity generally result in decreased energy consumption, particularly by industrial and large commercial companies, a loss of existing customers, and fewer new customers especially in newly constructed buildings. As a consequence, national or regional recessions or other downturns in economic activity could adversely affect the Utilities\u2019 revenues and cash flows or restrict their future growth. Economic conditions in the Utilities\u2019 service territories may also adversely impact the Utilities\u2019 ability to collect accounts receivable, resulting in an increase in bad debt expense.\nBecause of competition, the Utilities may not be able to retain existing customers or acquire new customers, which could have an adverse impact on their business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Utilities face the risk that larger commercial or industrial customers may bypass gas distribution services by gaining distribution directly from interstate pipelines or, in the case of Spire Alabama and Spire Gulf, also from municipally or publicly owned gas distributors located adjacent to its service territory. The Utilities cannot provide any assurance that increased competition will not have a material adverse effect on their business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Utilities compete with distributors offering a broad range of services and prices, from full-service distributors to those offering delivery only. The Utilities also compete for retail customers with suppliers of alternative energy products, principally propane and electricity, and to a growing extent, distributed sources of renewable energy. If they are unable to compete effectively, the Utilities may lose existing customers and/or fail to acquire new customers, which in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on their business, results of operations and financial condition. Along those lines, changes in wholesale natural gas prices compared with prices for electricity, fuel oil, coal, propane, or other energy sources can significantly impact the cost of delivered natural gas, which may affect the Utilities\u2019 retention of natural gas customers and may adversely impact their financial condition and results of operations.\nRegional supply/demand fluctuations and changes in national infrastructure, as well as regulatory discretion, may adversely affect the Utilities\u2019 ability to profit from off-system sales and capacity release.\nSpire Missouri\u2019s and Spire Alabama\u2019s income from off-system sales and capacity release is subject to fluctuations in market conditions and changing supply and demand conditions in areas the Utilities hold pipeline capacity rights. Specific factors impacting the Utilities\u2019 income from off-system sales and capacity release include the availability of attractively priced natural gas supply, availability of pipeline capacity, and market demand. Income from off-system sales and capacity release is shared with customers. Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama are allowed to retain 25% of the net margins achieved as a result of such off-system sales and capacity release. The Utilities\u2019 ability to retain such income in the future is subject to regulatory discretion. In fact, as of April 2022, Spire Alabama can only retain the 25% of capacity release after the first $1.6 million goes entirely to customers (while sharing remains immediate for off-system sales).\nRISKS THAT RELATE TO THE GAS MARKETING SEGMENT\nIncreased competition, fluctuations in natural gas commodity prices, expiration of supply and transportation arrangements, and infrastructure projects may adversely impact the future profitability of Gas Marketing.\nCompetition in the marketplace and fluctuations in natural gas commodity prices have a direct impact on the Gas Marketing business. Changing market conditions and prices, the narrowing of regional and seasonal price differentials and limited future price volatility may adversely impact its sales margins or affect its ability to procure gas supplies and/or to serve certain customers, which may reduce sales profitability and/or increase certain credit requirements caused by reductions in netting capability. Also, Gas Marketing profitability may be impacted by the effects of the expiration, in the normal course of business, of certain of its natural gas supply contracts if those contracts cannot be replaced and/or renewed with arrangements with similar terms and pricing. Although the FERC regulates the interstate transportation of natural gas and establishes the general terms and conditions under which Spire Marketing may use interstate gas pipeline capacity to purchase and transport natural gas, Spire Marketing must occasionally renegotiate its transportation agreements with a concentrated group of pipeline companies. Renegotiated terms of new agreements, or increases in FERC-authorized rates of existing agreements, may impact Gas Marketing\u2019s future profitability. Profitability may also be adversely impacted if pipeline capacity or future storage capacity secured is not fully utilized.\nReduced access to credit and/or capital markets may prevent the Gas Marketing business from executing operating strategies.\nThe Gas Marketing segment relies on its cash flows, ability to effect net settlements with counterparties, parental guaranties, and access to Spire\u2019s liquidity resources to satisfy its credit and working capital requirements. Spire Marketing\u2019s ability to rely on parental guaranties is dependent upon Spire\u2019s financial condition and credit ratings. If Spire\u2019s credit ratings were lowered, particularly below investment grade, counterparty acceptance of parental guaranties may diminish, resulting in decreased availability of credit. Additionally, under such circumstances, certain counterparties may require Spire Marketing to provide prepayments or cash deposits, amounts of which would be dependent upon natural gas market conditions. Reduced access to credit or increased credit requirements, which may also be caused by factors such as higher overall natural gas prices, may limit Spire Marketing\u2019s ability to enter into certain transactions. In addition, Spire Marketing has concentrations of counterparty credit risk in that a significant portion of its transactions are with (or are associated with) energy producers, utility companies, and pipelines. These concentrations of counterparties have the potential to affect the Company\u2019s overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that each of these three groups may be affected similarly by changes in economic, industry, or other conditions. Spire Marketing also has concentrations of credit risk in certain individually significant counterparties. Spire Marketing closely monitors its credit exposure and, although uncollectible amounts have not been significant, increased counterparty defaults are possible and may result in financial losses and/or capital limitations.\nRisk management policies, including the use of derivative instruments, may not fully protect Spire Marketing\u2019s sales and results of operations from volatility and may result in financial losses.\nIn the course of its business, Spire Marketing enters into contracts to purchase and sell natural gas at fixed prices and index-based prices. Commodity price risk associated with these contracts has the potential to impact earnings and cash flows. To minimize this risk, Spire Marketing has a risk management policy that provides for daily monitoring of a number of business measures, including fixed price commitments.\nSpire Marketing currently manages the commodity price risk associated with fixed-price commitments for the purchase or sale of natural gas by either closely matching the offsetting physical purchase or sale of natural gas at fixed prices or through the use of natural gas futures, options, and swap contracts traded on or cleared through the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. and/or the Intercontinental Exchange to lock in margins. These exchange-traded/cleared contracts may be designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions. However, market conditions and regional price changes may cause ineffective portions of matched positions to result in financial losses. Additionally, to the extent that Spire Marketing\u2019s natural gas contracts are classified as trading activities or do not otherwise qualify for the normal purchases or normal sales designation (or the designation is not elected), the contracts are recorded as derivatives at fair value each period. Accordingly, the associated gains and losses are reported directly in earnings and may cause volatility in results of operations. Gains or losses (realized and unrealized) on certain wholesale purchase and sale contracts, consisting of those classified as trading activities, are required to be presented on a net basis (instead of a gross basis) in the statements of consolidated income. Such presentation could result in volatility in the Company\u2019s operating revenues.\nAs a natural gas market participant, Spire Marketing is subject to applicable FERC- and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)-administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, including those directed generally to prevent manipulation of or fraud involving natural gas physical transactions and financial instruments, such as futures, options and swaps. Spire Marketing could be subject to substantial penalties and fines by the FERC or CFTC, or both, for failure to comply with such rules.\nSpire Marketing\u2019s ability to meet its customers\u2019 natural gas requirements may be impaired if contracted gas supplies and interstate pipeline services are not available or delivered in a timely manner.\nSpire Marketing\u2019s ability to deliver natural gas to its customers is contingent upon the ability of natural gas producers, other gas marketers, and interstate pipelines to fulfill delivery obligations to Spire Marketing under firm contracts. To the extent that it is unable to obtain the necessary supplies, Spire Marketing\u2019s financial position and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nRegulatory and legislative developments pertaining to the energy industry may adversely impact Gas Marketing\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Gas Marketing business is non-regulated, in that the rates it charges its customers are not currently established by or subject to approval by any regulatory body with jurisdiction over its business. However, it is subject to various laws and regulations affecting the energy industry. New regulatory and legislative actions may adversely impact Gas Marketing\u2019s results of operations and financial condition by potentially reducing customer growth opportunities and/or increasing the costs of doing business.\nGas Marketing uses bilateral contracts and derivative instruments such as futures contracts, options and swaps to hedge or mitigate ongoing commercial risks. Most standardized swaps, under the Dodd-Frank Act, are required to be cleared through a registered clearing facility and traded on a designated exchange or swap execution facility, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, the CFTC\u2019s rules require companies, including Spire Marketing, to maintain regulatory records of swap transactions, and to report swaps to centralized swap data repositories, among other compliance obligations. Although Spire Marketing may qualify for exceptions to certain of these CFTC rules, its derivatives counterparties are subject to capital, margin, documentation and business conduct requirements imposed as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act. These obligations may increase transaction costs and may make it more difficult for Spire Marketing to enter into hedging transactions on favorable terms or affect the number and/or creditworthiness of available swap counterparties. Spire Marketing\u2019s inability to enter into derivatives instruments or other commercial risk hedging transactions on favorable terms, or at all, could increase operating expenses and expose it to unhedged commercial risks, including potential adverse changes in commodity prices.\nIn October 2020, the CFTC finalized its rules that modify and expand the applicability of speculative position limits on the amounts of certain futures contracts (including options thereon), cash-settled \u201clookalike\u201d contracts for or linked to the commodities underlying the foregoing futures contracts, as well as economically equivalent swaps containing \u201cidentical material\u201d contractual specifications, terms and conditions as the foregoing contracts. While Spire Marketing anticipates qualifying for a bona fide hedging exemption from such limits, the CFTC\u2019s final rules and earlier adopted aggregation rules may cause Spire Marketing\u2019s hedging strategies described above to be limited if Spire Marketing is unable to qualify for an exemption.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nUnexpected losses may adversely affect Spire\u2019s or its subsidiaries\u2019 financial condition and results of operations.\nAs with most businesses, there are operations and business risks inherent in the activities of Spire\u2019s subsidiaries. If, in the normal course of business, Spire or any of its subsidiaries becomes a party to litigation, such litigation could result in substantial monetary judgments, fines, or penalties or be resolved on unfavorable terms. In accordance with customary practice, Spire and its subsidiaries maintain insurance against a significant portion of, but not all, risks and losses. In addition, in the normal course of its operations, Spire and its subsidiaries may be exposed to loss from other sources, such as bad debt expense or the failure of a counterparty to meet its financial obligations. Spire and its operating companies employ many strategies to gain assurance that such risks are appropriately managed, mitigated, or insured, as appropriate. To the extent a loss is not fully covered by insurance or other risk mitigation strategies, that loss could adversely affect the Company\u2019s and/or its subsidiaries\u2019 financial condition and results of operations.\nCatastrophic events may adversely affect the Company\u2019s facilities and operations.\nCatastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, tropical storms, winter storms, terrorist acts, acts of civil unrest, pandemic illnesses or other similar occurrences could adversely affect the Utilities\u2019 facilities and operations, as well as those of Spire STL Pipeline and Spire Storage. The Utilities have emergency planning and training programs in place to respond to events that could cause business interruptions. However, unanticipated events or a combination of events, failure in resources needed to respond to events, or slow or inadequate response to events may have an adverse impact on the operations, financial condition, and results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries. To the extent the impacts of such catastrophic events are not covered by insurance or recovered in rates, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased dependence on technology may hinder Spire\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 business operations and adversely affect their financial condition and results of operations if such technologies fail.\nSpire and its subsidiaries have implemented or acquired a variety of technological tools including both Company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties. These tools and systems support critical functions including Spire and its subsidiaries\u2019 integrated planning, scheduling and dispatching of field resources, its automated meter reading system, customer care and billing, procurement and accounts payable, operational plant logistics, management reporting, and external financial reporting. The failure of these or other similarly important technologies, or the Company\u2019s or its subsidiaries\u2019 inability to have these technologies supported, updated, expanded, or integrated into other technologies, could hinder their business operations and, to the extent not covered by insurance, could adversely impact their financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough the Company and its subsidiaries have, when possible, developed alternative sources of technology and built redundancy into their computer networks and tools, there can be no assurance that these efforts to date would protect against all potential issues related to the loss of any such technologies or the Utilities\u2019 use of such technologies.\nA cyberattack may disrupt Spire\u2019s operations or lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information or potential liability.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to cybersecurity risks primarily related to breaches of security pertaining to sensitive customer, employee, and vendor information maintained by the Company, its subsidiaries, or its third-party vendors in the normal course of business, as well as breaches in the technology that manages natural gas distribution operations and other business processes. A loss of confidential or proprietary data or security breaches of technology for operations or business processes could adversely affect the Company\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 reputation, diminish customer confidence, disrupt operations, and subject the Company and its subsidiaries to possible financial liability, any of which could have a material effect on the Company\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company acknowledges that increased dependence on technology increases the Company\u2019s exposure to cyberattack. The Company and its subsidiaries closely monitor both preventive and detective measures to manage these risks and maintain cyber risk insurance to mitigate a significant portion, but not all, of these risks and losses. To the extent that the occurrence of any of these cyber events is not covered by insurance, it could adversely affect the Company\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 financial condition and results of operations.\nWorkforce risks may affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various workforce risks, including, but not limited to, the risk that it will be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel; that it will be unable to effectively transfer to new personnel the knowledge and expertise of an aging workforce as those workers retire; and that it will be unable to reach collective bargaining arrangements with the unions that represent certain of its workers, which could result in work stoppages.\nResources expended to pursue or integrate business acquisitions, investments or other business arrangements may adversely affect Spire\u2019s financial position and results of operations and return on investments made may not meet the Company\u2019s expectations.\nFrom time to time, Spire may seek to grow through strategic acquisitions, investments or other business arrangements. Attractive acquisition and investment opportunities may be difficult to complete on economically acceptable terms. It is possible for Spire to expend considerable resources pursuing acquisitions and investments but, for a variety of reasons, decide not to move forward. Similarly, investment opportunities may be hindered or halted by regulatory or legal actions. To the extent that acquisitions or investments are made, such transactions involve a number of risks, including but not limited to, the assumption of material liabilities, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from daily operations, difficulties in assimilation and retention of employees, securing adequate capital to support the transaction, and regulatory approval. Uncertainties exist in assessing the value, risks, profitability, and liabilities associated with certain businesses or assets and there is a possibility that anticipated operating and financial efficiencies expected to result from an acquisition or investment do not develop. Additionally, there are no assurances that resources expended will achieve their intended result.\nThe failure to complete an acquisition successfully or to integrate acquisitions or investments it may undertake could have an adverse effect on the Spire\u2019s financial condition and results of operations and the market\u2019s perception of the Company\u2019s execution of its strategy. To the extent Spire engages in any of the above activities together with or through one or more of its subsidiaries, including the Utilities, such subsidiaries may face the same risks.\nChanges in accounting standards may adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nSpire and its subsidiaries are subject to changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), SEC regulations and other interpretations of financial reporting requirements for public utilities. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries have any control over the impact these changes may have on their financial condition or results of operations nor the timing of such changes. The potential issues associated with rate-regulated accounting, along with other potential changes to GAAP that the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) continues to consider may be significant.", "PERMNO": 12781, "SIC": 4924, "TIC": "SR"}
