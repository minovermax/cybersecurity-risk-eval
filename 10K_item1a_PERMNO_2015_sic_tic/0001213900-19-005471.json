{"cik": "1604868", "company": "GrowGeneration Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-04-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. You should read these Risk Factors in conjunction with \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Item 8. There also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material. Those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations.\nWe face intense competition that could prohibit us from developing or increasing our customer base and generating revenue.\nThe industry within which we compete is highly competitive. We compete with companies that have greater capital resources, facilities and diversity of product lines. We compete in the specialty gardening industry, selling hydroponic and organic nutrients, soils and other gardening related products. Additionally, if demand for our hydroponic growing equipment and products continues to grow, we expect many new competitors to enter the market, as there are no significant barriers to retail sales of hydroponic growing equipment and related gardening products. More established gardening companies with much greater financial resources which do not currently compete with us may be able to easily adapt their existing operations to sales of hydroponic growing equipment. Due to this competition, there is no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in increasing revenues and maintaining market share. In addition, increased competition may lead to reduced prices and/or margins for products we sell. Our competitors may also introduce new hydroponic growing equipment, manufacturers may sell equipment direct to consumers, and our distributers could cease sales of product to us.\nIf we need additional capital to fund our operations, we may not be able to obtain sufficient capital and may be forced to limit the scope of our operations.\nOur capital needs will depend on numerous factors, including (i) our profitability; (ii) the release of competitive products by our competition; (iii) the level of our investment in sales and marketing; and (iv) new store openings and or acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain capital in the future to meet our needs. If we cannot obtain additional funding, we may be required to: (i) limit our expansion; (ii) limit our marketing efforts; and (iii) decrease or eliminate capital expenditures. Such reductions could materially adversely affect our business and our ability to compete. Moreover, even if we do find a source of additional capital, we may not be able to negotiate terms and conditions for receiving the additional capital that are favorable to us. In addition, any future capital investments could dilute or otherwise materially and adversely affect the holdings or rights of our existing shareholders.\nOur business depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our executive officers and our business may be severely disrupted if we lose their services.\nOur future success depends substantially on the continued services of our executive officers, especially our Chief Executive Officer, Darren Lampert, our President, Michael Salaman, our Chief Operating Officer, Joseph Prinzivalli and our Chief Financial Officer, Monty Lamirato. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers and directors. If one or more of our executive officers are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to replace them readily, if at all. Therefore, our business may be severely disrupted, and we may incur additional expenses to recruit and retain new officers.\nIf we are not successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy.\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive hydroponics and gardening industry depends in large part upon our ability to attract highly qualified managerial and sales personnel. In order to induce valuable employees to come and work for us or to remain with us, we intend to provide employees with stock options that vest over time. The value to employees of stock options that vest over time will be significantly affected by movements in our stock price that we will not be able to control and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled junior, mid-level, and senior personnel.\nIn order to increase our sales and marketing infrastructure, we will need to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs we continue to work to open and/or acquire additional retail store locations, we will need to expand the size of our employee base for managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other resources. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees. In addition, our management may have to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. Our future financial performance and our ability to continue to grow our operation and compete in the hydroponics industry effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth.\nLitigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time in the normal course of our business operations, we may become subject to litigation that may result in liability material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are required. The cost to defend such litigation may be significant and may require a diversion of our resources. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not obtain insurance coverage to adequately cover all significant risk exposures.\nWe will be exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products we provide. We currently maintain property and casualty, automobile, and business interruption insurance and there can be no assurance that we will acquire or maintain insurance for certain risks, that the amount of our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities, or that we will not be forced to bear substantial costs resulting from risks and uncertainties of business. It is also not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks and liabilities. The failure to obtain adequate insurance coverage on terms favorable to us, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal practices could change with respect to providers of equipment potentially usable by participants in the medical cannabis industry, which could adversely impact us.\nIf the federal government were to change its practices or were to expend its resources attacking providers of equipment that could be usable by participants in the medical or recreational cannabis industry, such action could have a materially adverse effect on our operations, our customers, or the sales of our products.\nCannabis remains illegal under federal law and a change in federal enforcement practices could significantly and negatively affect our business indirectly.\nState laws legalizing medicinal and adult cannabis use are in conflict with the Federal Controlled Substances Act, which classifies cannabis as a Schedule-I controlled substance and makes cannabis use and possession illegal on a national level. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that the Federal government has the right to regulate and criminalize cannabis, even for medical purposes, and thus Federal law criminalizing the use of cannabis preempts state laws that legalize its use. While the prior Obama Administration had effectively stated that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct Federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical and recreational cannabis, on January 4, 2018, the United States Attorney General announced the rescission of the Obama Administration\u2019s policy, which indirectly negatively impacted our business.\nContinued legislative authorization of cannabis at the state level is uncertain, and slow or halt use of cannabis caused by state legislation would negatively impact our business.\nOur products are sold to growers of various crops, including cannabis. Disruption to the cannabis industry could cause some potential customers to be more reluctant to invest in growing equipment, including equipment we sell. Currently, 34 states and the District of Columbia allow its citizens to use medical cannabis. Additionally, Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis for adult recreational use, and additional recreational measures are expected to be pursued by other states in the future. Continued development of the cannabis industry is dependent upon continued legislative authorization of cannabis at the state level. Any number of factors could slow or halt progress in this area. Further, progress in the cannabis industry, while encouraging, is not assured. While there may be ample public support for legislative action, numerous factors impact the legislative process. Any one of these factors could slow or halt use of cannabis, which would negatively impact our business.\nOur past private placements were made pursuant to an exemption from registration.\nSince 2014, various private placements conducted by the Company were made in reliance upon the so-called \u201cprivate placement\u201d exemption from registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) provided by Sections 4(a)(2) of the 1933 Securities Act, by Regulation D, Rule 506 adopted there under, and the exemptions from registration provided by the Blue-Sky laws of states in which our securities are offered. However, reliance upon these exemptions is highly technical and should not be viewed as a guarantee that such exemptions are indeed available. If for any reason the private placement exemption is not available for past private placements and no other exemption from registration is found to be available, the sale of the securities in such private placements would be deemed to have been made in violation of the applicable laws, thus requiring registration of those securities. As a remedy for such a violation, each investor would have the right to rescind its purchase and to have its full investment returned. If an investor requests return of its investment, it is possible that funds would not be available to us for that purpose, and that liquidation of us may be required. Any refunds made would reduce funds available to us for our operations. A significant number of requests for rescission would probably leave us without funds sufficient to respond to such requests or to proceed successfully with its activities.\nThere are a significant number of shares of common stock eligible for sale, which could depress the market price of such shares.\nOur Registration Statement on Form S-1 has registered a total of 2,123,911 shares of our common stock available for sale in the public market. The availability of such a large number of shares of common stock for sale in the public market could harm the market price of the stock. Further, additional shares may be offered from time to time in the open market pursuant to Rule 144, and these sales may have a depressive effect as well.\nWe are under the obligation to repay our convertible promissory notes upon maturity.\nOn January 17, 2018, the Company completed a private placement of units of its securities and raised gross proceeds of $9,000,000 from certain accredited investors in the offering. Each unit consists of (i) a .1% unsecured convertible promissory note of the principal amount of $250,000, and (ii) a 3-year warrant entitling the holder to purchase 37,500 shares of Common Stock, at a price of $.01 per share or through cashless exercise. The principal and interest of the promissory notes will be due and payable by the Company in three years from the date of issuance. Inability to repay the promissory notes on maturity, if the promissory notes are neither converted nor extended, will result in the financial condition of the Company to be materially adversely affected.\nThe promissory notes are convertible into shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock at the holders\u2019 option at $3 per share. If a large number of holders choose to convert their promissory notes, it may cause substantial dilution on other shareholders\u2019 ownership of the Company\u2019s securities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the principal amount of the promissory notes and accrued interest in the total amount of $5,927,677, net of unamortized debt discount of $2,305,746, was converted into 2,013,294 shares of common stock at the conversion rate of $3.00 per share. At December 31, 2018, the remaining principal amount of the promissory notes totaled $3,075,000, which is convertible into a large number of shares of our common stock.\nIf our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or if the public perceives that such sales could occur, this could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock, even if there is no relationship between such sales and the performance of our business.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities.\nWe face a potential risk of product liability as a result of any of the products that we offer for sale. For example, we may be sued if any product we sell allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf decreased demand for products that we may offer for sale;\n\u25cf injury to our reputation;\n\u25cf costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u25cf a diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u25cf substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u25cf product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions; and\n\u25cf a decline in our stock price.\nWe do not maintain any product liability insurance. Our inability to obtain and retain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products we developed. Even if we obtain product liability insurance in the future, we may have to pay amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts.\nWe may acquire businesses or products, or form strategic alliances, in the future, and we may not realize the benefits of such acquisitions.\nWe may acquire additional businesses or products, form strategic alliances or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. If we acquire businesses with promising markets or products, we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring such businesses if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture. We may encounter numerous difficulties in developing, manufacturing and/or marketing any new products resulting from a strategic alliance or acquisition that delay or prevent us from realizing their expected benefits or enhancing our business. We cannot assure you that, following any such acquisition, we will achieve the expected synergies to justify the transaction.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur officers and directors will control our company for the foreseeable future, including the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval.\nAt of the date hereof, our officers and directors collectively beneficially own approximately 10.49% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock on a primary basis and 13.40% of our outstanding shares in Common Stock if they exercise all their options and warrants. Certain of these individuals also have significant control over our business, policies and affairs as officers or directors of our company. Therefore, you should not invest in reliance on your ability to have any control over our Company.\nLimited public market for our common stock currently exists, and an active trading market may not develop or be sustained.\nAs we are in our early stages, an investment in our company will likely require a long-term commitment, with no certainty of return. The Company\u2019s common stock started trading on the OTCQB Marketplace on November 11, 2016 and started trading on the OTCQX Best Market on October 10, 2017. There is currently a limited public market for our common stock and there is no guarantee that any sustained trading market will develop in the near future or at all. In the absence of an active trading market:\n\u25cf investors may have difficulty buying and selling or obtaining market quotations;\n\u25cf market visibility for shares of our common stock may be limited; and\n\u25cf a lack of visibility for shares of our common stock may have a depressive effect on the market price for shares of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock may be significantly volatile.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u25cf changes in financial or operational estimates or projections;\n\u25cf conditions in markets generally;\n\u25cf changes in the economic performance or market valuations of companies similar to ours; and\n\u25cf general economic or political conditions in the United States or elsewhere.\nThe securities market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock.\nOur common stock may be considered a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d and thereby be subject to additional sale and trading regulations that may make it more difficult to sell.\nThe SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system). The OTCBB and OTCQX Best Market do not meet such requirements and if the price of our common stock is less than $5.00, our common stock will be deemed penny stocks. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document containing specified information. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive (i) the purchaser\u2019s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement; (ii) a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks; and (iii) a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock, and therefore stock holders may have difficulty selling their shares.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may also limit your ability to buy and sell our common stock, which could depress the price of our shares.\nFINRA rules require broker-dealers to have reasonable grounds for believing that an investment is suitable for a customer before recommending that investment to the customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status and investment objectives, among other things. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability such speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. Thus, FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our shares, have an adverse effect on the market for our shares, and thereby depress our share price.\nOur shareholders may face significant restrictions on the resale of their shares due to state \u201cblue sky\u201d laws.\nEach state has its own securities laws, often called \u201cblue sky\u201d laws, which (1) limit sales of securities to a state\u2019s residents unless the securities are registered in that state or qualify for an exemption from registration, and (2) govern the reporting requirements for broker-dealers doing business directly or indirectly in the state. Before a security is sold in a state, there must be a registration in place to cover the transaction, or it must be exempt from registration. The applicable broker-dealer must also be registered in that state.\nWe do not know whether our securities will be registered or exempt from registration under the laws of any state. A determination regarding registration will be made by those broker-dealers, if any, who agree to serve as market makers for our common stock. There may be significant state blue sky law restrictions on the ability of investors to sell, and on purchasers to buy, our securities. The resale market for our common stock could be limited, as the holders of our common stock may be unable to resell their shares without the significant expense of state registration or qualification.\nThe shares of our common stock may experience substantial dilution by exercises of outstanding warrants and options.\nAs of the date hereof, we had outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of 3,643,250 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $1.75 per share, and options to purchase an aggregate of 1,525,500 shares of our common stock (out of which 1,093,831 are vested as of this date) at a weighted average exercise prices of $1.87 per share. The exercise of such outstanding options and warrants will result in substantial dilution of your investment. In addition, our shareholders may experience additional dilution if we issue common stock in the future. Any of such dilution may have adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and will be able take advantage of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act, and, for as long as we continue to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nThere may be limitations on the effectiveness of our internal controls, and a failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud may materially harm our company.\nProper systems of internal controls over financial accounting and disclosure are critical to the operation of a public company. Management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures.\nMoreover, we do not expect that disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting, even if established, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud could materially adversely impact us.", "PERMNO": 19137, "SIC": 5200, "TIC": "GRWG"}
