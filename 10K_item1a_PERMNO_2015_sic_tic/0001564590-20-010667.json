The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or other factors not perceived by us to present significant risks to our business at this time may also significantly impair our business operations. Our business could be harmed by any of these risks. Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes, before making any decision to purchase our common stock. If any of the possible adverse events described below actually occurs, we may be unable to conduct our business as currently planned and our prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially harmed. In addition, the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of the events described below, and you may lose all or part of your investment. In assessing these risks, you should refer to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred losses since inception, have a limited operating history on which to assess our business, and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe are a clinical development-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. We have incurred net losses in each year since 2009, including net losses attributable to common shareholders of $69.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $164.1 million.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $126.6 million. In August 2017, we raised approximately $60.0 million though private placements of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock. In September 2018, we completed a public offering of 9,430,000 shares of common stock at an offering price of $5.50 per share, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase up to 1,230,000 additional shares of common stock. We received net proceeds of approximately $48.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering related transaction costs. On December 21, 2018, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-228975) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, which was automatically declared effective on February 13, 2019. In December 2018 we entered into the Sales Agreement with Cantor, pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50,000,000 from time to time through Cantor acting as our agent. Under the Sales Agreement, Cantor may sell the shares by any method permitted by law and deemed to be an \u201cat the market\u201d offering as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act. To date, we have not sold any shares under the Sales Agreement. In November 2019, we completed a public offering of 6,000,000 shares of common stock at an offering price of $8.00 per share and 250 shares of newly designated Series A convertible preferred stock at an offering price of $8,000.00 per share, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase up to 900,000 additional shares of common stock. We received net proceeds of approximately $53.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering related transaction costs. We will continue to require substantial additional capital to continue our clinical development and potential commercialization activities. Accordingly, we will need to raise substantial additional capital to continue to fund our operations. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the pace and results of our clinical development efforts. Failure to raise capital as and when needed, on favorable terms or at all, would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop our drug candidates.\nWe have devoted substantially all of our financial resources to identify, acquire, and develop our drug candidates, including conducting clinical trials and providing general and administrative support for our operations. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and convertible promissory notes. The amount of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of our future expenditures and our ability to obtain funding through equity or debt financings, strategic collaborations or grants. Biopharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. We expect losses to increase as we complete Phase I development and advance into Phase II development of our lead drug candidates. We have not yet commenced pivotal clinical trials for any drug candidate and it may be several years, if ever, before we complete pivotal clinical trials and have a drug candidate approved for commercialization. We expect to invest significant funds into the research and development of our current drug candidates to determine the potential to advance these drug candidates to regulatory approval.\nIf we obtain regulatory approval to market one or more products, our future revenue will depend upon the size of any markets in which our drug candidates may receive approval, and our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, pricing, reimbursement from third-party payors and adequate market share for our drug candidates in those markets. Even if we obtain adequate market share for one or more products, because the potential markets in which our drug candidates may ultimately receive regulatory approval could be very small, we may never become profitable despite obtaining such market share and acceptance of our products.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future and our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:\n\u2022\ncontinue the clinical development of our drug candidates;\n\u2022\ncontinue efforts to discover or acquire via assignment or in-license new drug candidates;\n\u2022\nundertake the manufacturing of our drug candidates or increase volumes manufactured by third parties;\n\u2022\nadvance our programs into larger, more expensive clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninitiate additional preclinical, clinical, or other trials or studies for our drug candidates;\n\u2022\nseek regulatory and marketing approvals and reimbursement for our drug candidates;\n\u2022\nestablish a sales, marketing, and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval and market for ourselves;\n\u2022\nseek to identify, assess, acquire, and/or develop other drug candidates;\n\u2022\nmake milestone, royalty or other payments under third-party license agreements;\n\u2022\nseek to maintain, protect, and expand our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022\nevaluate possible, or participate in actual, development partnerships with one or more third parties\n\u2022\nseek to attract and retain skilled personnel; and\n\u2022\nexperience any delays or encounter issues with the development and potential for regulatory approval of our clinical candidates such as safety issues, clinical trial accrual delays, longer follow-up for planned studies, additional major studies or supportive studies necessary to support marketing approval.\nFurther, the net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, such that a period-to-period comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income, if any, may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $126 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards, of which $63 million will begin to expire in 2024, if not utilized, and the remaining $63 million of which can be carried forward indefinitely. Tax loss carryforwards that were created prior to December 31, 2017 expire through 2037, all tax loss carryforwards created after that date do not expire. In the United States, utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and similar state provisions due to ownership change limitations that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. The merger with Private Molecular (the \u201cMerger\u201d) resulted in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code for us, and our pre-Merger NOL carryforwards and certain other tax attributes will be subject to limitation or elimination. The NOL carryforwards and certain other tax attributes of ours may also be subject to limitations as a result of ownership changes. If we were to lose the benefits of these loss carryforwards, our future earnings and cash resources would be materially and adversely affected. We have incurred net losses since our inception, and we anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future; thus, we do not know whether or when we will generate the U.S. federal taxable income necessary to utilize our NOLs.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and if we are unable to remediate such material weakness and to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, there could be an elevated possibility of a material misstatement, and such a misstatement could cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must report on its evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting. As disclosed in Item 9A of this report, we have identified a material weakness as of December 31, 2019 in our internal control over financial reporting related to our information technology general controls over systems that are relevant to our financial statements. As a result of the material weakness, our external auditors have issued an adverse opinion indicating that we have not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019.\nOur management team has taken action to begin to remediate the material weakness, primarily through improved processes, policies, training and skilled personnel, but we cannot be certain when the remediation will be completed. If we fail to fully remediate the material weakness or fail to maintain effective internal controls, it could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements or cause our stock price to decline. In future periods, we may identify additional deficiencies in our system of internal control over financial reporting during the course of our remediation efforts that may require additional work to address. Any future material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and we could be required to restate our financial results, which could lead to substantial additional costs for accounting and legal fees and shareholder litigation. Moreover, any future disclosures of additional weaknesses, or errors as a result of those weaknesses, could result in could result in investors losing confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in the stock price. For more information about this material weakness, see Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we became an \u201caccelerated filer\u201d and are therefore subject to the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.\nBecause the worldwide market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $75 million (but was less than $700 million), as of the last business day of our fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2019, we are an \u201caccelerated filer\u201d as defined by SEC rule. We are not an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d. Therefore, we are now subject to the requirement that we include in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, the auditor\u2019s attestation report on assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we do not have a sufficient history for us and our independent registered public accounting firm to test and evaluate our new processes and controls, we may be unable to obtain an unqualified attestation report from our independent registered public accounting firm required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If our independent registered public accounting firm is not able to render an unqualified attestation, it could result in lost investor confidence in the accuracy, reliability, and completeness of our financial reports. We expect that our status as an accelerated filer and compliance with these increased requirements will require management to expend additional time while also condensing the time frame available to comply with certain requirements, which may further increase our legal and financial compliance costs.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC. If we cannot favorably assess, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investor confidence in the reliability of our financial reports may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nWe have never generated any revenue from product sales and may never become profitable.\nWe have no products approved for commercialization and have never generated any revenue. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends on our ability, alone or with strategic collaboration partners, to successfully complete the development of, and obtain the regulatory and marketing approvals necessary to commercialize one or more of our drug candidates. We do not anticipate generating revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future. Our ability to generate future revenue from product sales depends heavily on our success in many areas, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\ncompleting research and development of one or more of our drug candidates;\n\u2022\nobtaining regulatory and marketing approvals for one or more of our drug candidates;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing one or more drug candidates and establishing and maintaining supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties that are commercially feasible;\n\u2022\nmarketing, launching and commercializing one or more drug candidates for which we obtain regulatory and marketing approval, either directly or with a collaborator or distributor;\n\u2022\ngaining market acceptance of one or more of our drug candidates as treatment options;\n\u2022\nmeeting our supply needs in sufficient quantities to meet market demand for our drug candidates, if approved;\n\u2022\naddressing any competing products;\n\u2022\nprotecting, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets and know-how;\n\u2022\nnegotiating favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter;\n\u2022\nobtaining reimbursement or pricing for one or more of our drug candidates that supports profitability; and\n\u2022\nattracting, hiring and retaining qualified personnel.\nEven if one or more of the drug candidates that we develop is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with launching and commercializing any approved drug candidate. We also will have to develop or acquire manufacturing capabilities or continue to contract with contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, in order to continue development and potential commercialization of our drug candidates. For instance, if our costs of manufacturing our drug products are not commercially feasible, then we will need to develop or procure our drug products in a commercially feasible manner to successfully commercialize any future approved product, if any. Additionally, if we are not able to generate revenue from the sale of any approved products, we may never become profitable.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates. Future debt obligations may expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition and may result in further dilution to our stockholders.\nUnless and until we can generate a substantial amount of revenue from our drug candidates, we expect to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or collaborations, licensing arrangements and government funding arrangements. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations, even if we believe that we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. On December 21, 2018, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-228975) with the SEC, which was automatically declared effective on February 13, 2019. In December 2018 we entered into the Sales Agreement with Cantor, pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50,000,000 from time to time through Cantor acting as our agent. Under the Sales Agreement, Cantor may sell the shares by any method permitted by law and deemed to be an \u201cat the market\u201d offering as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act. To date, we have not sold any shares under the Sales Agreement.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity, convertible debt or other securities convertible into equity, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these new securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect rights of our stockholders. Debt financing, if available at all, would likely involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, making additional product acquisitions or declaring or paying dividends. For instance, our term loan facility with Perceptive Credit Holdings II, LP limits additional indebtedness, liens, guaranties, mergers and consolidations, substantial asset sales, investments and loans, sale and leasebacks, transactions with affiliates\nand fundamental changes. If we raise additional funds through strategic collaborations or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our drug candidates or future revenue streams or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. We cannot be assured that we will be able to obtain additional funding if and when necessary to fund our entire portfolio of drug candidates to meet our projected plans. If we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be required to delay or discontinue one or more of our development programs or the commercialization of any drug candidates or be unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on potential business opportunities, which could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, securing additional financing would require a substantial amount of time and attention from our management and may divert a disproportionate amount of their attention away from day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our management\u2019s ability to oversee the development of our drug candidates.\nWe also have historically received, and may receive in the future, funds from state or federal government grants for research and development. The grants have been, and any future government grants and contracts we may receive may be, subject to the risks and contingencies set forth below under this section titled \u201c-Risks Related to the Development of Our Drug candidates-Reliance on government funding for our programs may add uncertainty to our research and commercialization efforts with respect to those programs that are tied to such funding and may impose requirements that limit our ability to take certain actions, increase the costs of commercialization and production of drug candidates developed under those programs and subject us to potential financial penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d Although we might apply for government contracts and grants in the future, we cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining additional grants for any drug candidates or programs.\nChanges in interpretation or application of U.S. GAAP may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements to conform to U.S. GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC and various other regulatory and accounting bodies. A change in interpretations of, or our application of, these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced. In addition, when we are required to adopt new accounting standards, our methods of accounting for certain items may change, which could cause our results of operations to fluctuate from period to period and make it more difficult to compare our financial results to prior periods.\nRisks Related to the Development of Our Drug Candidates\nManufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our drug candidates and adversely affect our clinical trials.\nWe completed the construction of our current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, manufacturing facility during the second quarter of 2018 and we are developing the capability to manufacture drug candidates for use in the conduct of our clinical trials. We may not be able to manufacture drug candidates or there may be substantial technical or logistical challenges to supporting manufacturing demand for drug candidates. We may also fail to comply with cGMP requirements and standards which would require us to not utilize the manufacturing facility to make clinical trial supply.\nWe plan to rely in part on third-party manufacturers, and their responsibilities will include purchasing from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce our drug candidates for our clinical trials and future regulatory approval. We expect there to be a limited number of suppliers for some of the raw materials that we expect to use to manufacture our drug candidates, and we may not be able to identify alternative suppliers to prevent a possible disruption of the manufacture of our drug candidates for our clinical trials, and, if approved, ultimately for commercial sale.\nAlthough we generally do not expect to begin a clinical trial unless we believe we have a sufficient supply of a drug candidate to complete the trial, any significant delay or discontinuity in the supply of a drug candidate, or the raw materials or other material components in the manufacture of the drug candidate, could delay completion of our clinical trials and potential timing for regulatory approval of our drug candidates, which would harm our business and results of operations. We do not yet have sufficient information to reliably estimate the cost of the commercial manufacturing of our drug candidates and our current costs to manufacture our drug products may not be commercially feasible, and the actual cost to manufacture our drug candidates could materially and adversely affect the commercial viability of our drug candidates. As a result, we may never be able to develop a commercially viable product.\nIn addition, as a drug candidate manufacturer with one manufacturing facility, we are exposed to the following additional risks:\n\u2022\nlimited capacity of manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022\ncontamination of drug candidates in the manufacturing process;\n\u2022\nnatural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes or fires;\n\u2022\nlabor disputes or shortages, including the effects of health emergencies or natural disasters;\n\u2022\ncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nchanges in forecasts of future demand;\n\u2022\ntiming and actual number of production runs and production success rates and yields;\n\u2022\ncontractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers;\n\u2022\ntiming and outcome of product quality testing;\n\u2022\npower failures and/or other utility failures;\n\u2022\nbreakdown, failure, substandard performance or improper installation or operation of equipment;\n\u2022\nfollowing New Drug Application, or NDA, or Biologics License Application, or BLA, approval, a change in the manufacturing site could require additional approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA. This approval would require new testing and compliance inspections;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to timely formulate and manufacture our product or produce the quantity and quality required to meet our clinical and commercial needs, if any; and\n\u2022\nas a drug candidate manufacturer, we are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and some state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMPs and other U.S. and corresponding foreign requirements, and we carry the risk of non-compliance with these regulations and standards.\nFor example, in December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Any outbreak of contagious diseases such as coronavirus, or other adverse public health developments, could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations. Such adverse effects could include disruptions or restrictions on the ability of our, our collaborators\u2019, or our suppliers\u2019 personnel to travel, and could result in temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our collaborators or suppliers. Any disruption to our operations or the operations of our collaborators or suppliers would likely impact our drug development efforts, operating results, and our financial condition. The extent to which the coronavirus may impact our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus.\nEach of these risks could delay our clinical trials, the marketing approval, if any, of our drug candidates, or the commercialization of our drug candidates or result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenue. In addition, we rely on third parties to perform release testing on our drug candidates prior to delivery to subjects in our clinical trials. If these tests are not appropriately conducted and test data are not reliable, subjects in our clinical trials, or patients treated with our products, if any are approved in the future, could be put at risk of serious harm, which could result in product liability suits.\nClinical trials are costly, time consuming and inherently risky, and we may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities, and may never obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize certain or any of our drug candidates.\nClinical development is expensive, time consuming and involves significant risk. We cannot guarantee that any clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of development. Events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ninability to generate satisfactory preclinical, toxicology or other in vivo or in vitro data or to develop diagnostics capable of supporting the initiation or continuation of clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with clinical research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\ndelays or failure in obtaining required institutional review board, or IRB, approval at each clinical trial site;\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain or delays in obtaining a permit from regulatory authorities to conduct a clinical trial;\n\u2022\ndelays in recruiting or failure to recruit sufficient eligible volunteers or patients in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nfailure by clinical trial sites or CROs or other third parties to adhere to clinical trial requirements;\n\u2022\nfailure by our clinical trial sites, CROs or other third parties to perform in accordance with the good clinical practices requirements of the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory guidelines;\n\u2022\nsubjects or patients withdrawing from our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nadverse events or other issues of concern significant enough for the FDA, or comparable foreign regulatory authority, to put a clinical trial or an IND on clinical hold;\n\u2022\noccurrence of adverse events associated with our drug candidates;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols;\n\u2022\nthe cost of clinical trials of our drug candidates;\n\u2022\nnegative or inconclusive results from our clinical trials which may result in us deciding, or regulators requiring us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon development programs in other ongoing or planned indications for a drug candidate; and\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with third-party manufacturers or an inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of our drug candidates for use in clinical trials.\nAny inability to successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our drug candidates could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenue. In addition, if we make manufacturing or formulation changes to our drug candidates, we may need to conduct additional nonclinical studies and/or clinical trials to show that the results obtained from such new formulation are consistent with previous results obtained. Clinical trial delays could also shorten any periods during which our drug candidates have patent protection and may allow competitors to develop and bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our drug candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval for our drug candidates which would materially harm our business.\nThe approach we are taking to discover and develop next generation immunotoxin therapies, also commonly known as engineered toxin bodies, or ETBs, is unproven and may never lead to marketable products.\nThe scientific discoveries that form the basis for our efforts to discover and develop our drug candidates are relatively recent. To date, neither we nor any other company has received regulatory approval to market products utilizing ETBs. The scientific evidence to support the feasibility of developing drugs based on these discoveries is both preliminary and limited. Successful development of ETB therapeutic products by us will require addressing a number of issues, including identifying appropriate receptor targets, screening for and selecting potent and safe ETB drug candidates, developing a commercially feasible manufacturing process, successfully completing all required preclinical studies and clinical trials, successfully implementing all other requirements that may be mandated by regulatory agencies from clinical development through post-marketing periods, ensuring intellectual property protection in any territory where an ETB product may be commercialized and commercializing an ETB product successfully in a competitive product landscape. In addition, any drug candidates that we develop may not demonstrate in patients the biological or pharmacological properties ascribed to them in laboratory and preclinical testing, and they may interact with human biological systems in unforeseen, ineffective or even harmful ways. If we do not successfully develop and commercialize one or more drug candidates based upon this scientific approach, we may not become profitable and the value of our common stock may decline.\nFurther, our focus on ETB technology for developing drug candidates as opposed to multiple, more proven technologies for drug development increases the risk associated with our business. If we are not successful in developing an approved product using ETB technology, we may not be able to identify and successfully implement an alternative product development strategy. In addition, work by other companies pursuing similar immunotoxin technologies may encounter setbacks and difficulties that regulators and investors may attribute to our drug candidates, whether appropriate or not.\nWe are heavily dependent on the success of our drug candidates, the most advanced of which is in the early stages of clinical development. Our ETB therapeutic drug candidates are based on a relatively novel technology, which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of development and of subsequently obtaining regulatory approval, if at all. Some of our drug candidates have produced results in preclinical settings to date and we cannot give any assurance that we will generate data for any of our drug candidates sufficient to receive regulatory approval in our planned indications, which will be required before they can be commercialized. To date, no ETB products have been approved for marketing in the United States or elsewhere.\nWe have concentrated our research and development efforts to date on a limited number of drug candidates based on our ETB therapeutic platform and identifying our initial targeted disease indications. We have invested substantially all of our efforts and financial resources to identify, acquire and develop our portfolio of drug candidates. Our future success is dependent on our ability to successfully further develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize one or more drug candidates. We currently generate no revenue from sales of any products, and we may never be able to develop or commercialize a drug candidate. We currently have one ETB drug candidate, MT-3724, with three active clinical trials: one study is a phase I/II monotherapy study and two studies are phase IIa combination studies. A second ETB drug candidate, MT-5111, has one Phase I study, which was initiated in the third quarter of 2019. Our CD38 SLT-A fusion protein, TAK-169, developed in collaboration with Takeda, has one Phase I study, which was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2019, and the remainder of our drug candidates are in preclinical development. MT-3724 has been administered in patients with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. This is only one of the multiple indications for which we plan to develop this drug candidate. There can be no assurance that we will not experience problems or delays in developing our drug candidates and that such problems or delays will not cause unanticipated costs, or that any such development problems can be solved. Additionally, our clinical and preclinical data to date are not validated and we have no way of knowing if after validation our clinical trial data will be complete and consistent. There can be no assurance that the data that we develop for our drug candidates in our planned indications will be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval.\nNone of our ETB drug candidates have advanced into a pivotal clinical trial for our proposed indications and it may be years before any such clinical trial is initiated and completed, if at all. We are not permitted to market or promote any of our drug candidates before we receive regulatory approval from the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority, and we may never receive such regulatory approval for any of our drug candidates. We cannot be certain that any of our drug candidates will be successful in clinical trials or receive regulatory approval. Further, our drug candidates may not receive regulatory approval even if they are successful in clinical trials. If we do not receive regulatory approvals for our drug candidates, we may not be able to continue our operations.\nAdditionally, the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities have relatively limited experience with ETB products. No regulatory authority has granted approval to any person or entity, including us, to market or commercialize ETB drug candidates, which may increase the complexity, uncertainty and length of the regulatory approval process for our drug candidates. If our ETB drug candidates fail to prove to be safe, effective or commercially viable, our drug candidate pipeline would have little, if any, value, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe clinical trial and manufacturing requirements of the FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, and other regulatory authorities, and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of a drug candidate, vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of the drug candidate. The regulatory approval process for novel drug candidates such as ETB drug candidates could be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or more extensively studied drug candidates. It is difficult to determine how long it will take or how much it will cost to obtain regulatory approvals for our drug candidates in either the United States or the European Union or elsewhere or how long it will take to commercialize our drug candidates, even if approved for marketing. Approvals by the EMA and other regulatory authorities may not be indicative of what the FDA may require for approval, and vice versa, and different or additional preclinical studies and clinical trials may be required to support regulatory approval in each respective jurisdiction. Delay or failure to obtain, or unexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary to bring a drug candidate to market could decrease our ability to generate sufficient product revenue, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be harmed.\nWe may have difficulty enrolling, or fail to enroll patients, in our clinical trials given the limited number of patients who have the diseases for which our drug candidates are being studied, which could delay or prevent clinical trials of our drug candidates.\nIdentifying and enrolling patients to participate in clinical trials of our ETB drug candidates is essential to our success. The timing of our clinical trials depends in part on the rate at which we can recruit patients to participate in clinical trials of our drug candidates, and we may experience delays in our clinical trials if we encounter difficulties in enrollment.\nThe eligibility criteria of our planned clinical trials may further limit the available eligible trial participants as we require that patients have specific characteristics that we can measure or meet the criteria to assure their conditions are appropriate for inclusion in our clinical trials. For instance, the estimated incidence of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma in the United States is 74,200 new cases and approximately 19,970 deaths were attributable to non-Hodgkin\u2019s B-cell lymphomas in 2019. Patients must be diagnosed with relapsed or refractory B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma to be considered as an eligible trial participant for our Phase II combination study of MT-3724 with GEMOX. We may not be able to identify, recruit and enroll a sufficient number of patients to complete our clinical trials in a timely manner because of the perceived risks and benefits of the drug candidate under study, the availability and efficacy of competing therapies and clinical trials, and the willingness of physicians to participate in our planned clinical trials. If patients are unwilling to participate in our clinical trials for any reason, the timeline for conducting trials and obtaining regulatory approval of our drug candidates may be delayed.\nIf we experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trials of our drug candidates, the commercial prospects of our drug candidates could be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenue from any of these drug candidates could be delayed or prevented. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials would likely increase our overall costs, impair drug candidate development and jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval relative to our current plans. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition, and prospects significantly.\nOur drug candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial viability of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our drug candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay, or terminate clinical trials or result in a restrictive label or delay regulatory approval. In addition, our MT-3724 drug candidate has been studied in only a limited number of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, and the most common adverse event was anemia, diarrhea, nausea, stomatitis, asthenia, fatigue, peripheral edema, pyrexia, pneumonia, hypoalbuminemia, hypokalemia, arthralgia, myalgia, headache, insomnia, cough, dyspnea, rash or hypotension.\nIn addition to the side effects that are known to be associated with MT-3724, continued clinical trials could reveal higher incidence of side effects, or AEs, previously unknown side effects, and side effects with greater severity, which could each or all lead to delays in our clinical programs or discontinuation of our trials. There is no guarantee that additional or more severe side effects will not be identified through ongoing clinical trials of our drug candidates for current and other indications. Undesirable side effects and negative results for any of our drug candidates may negatively impact the development and potential for approval of our drug candidates for their proposed indications.\nAdditionally, even if one or more of our drug candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, potentially significant negative consequences could result, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such products;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to create a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, plan, which could include a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients, a communication plan for healthcare providers, and/or other elements to assure safe use;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to change the way such drug candidates are distributed or administered, or change the labeling of the drug candidates;\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to regulatory investigations and government enforcement actions;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may require us to conduct additional clinical trials or costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product;\n\u2022\nwe may decide to recall such drug candidates from the marketplace after they are approved;\n\u2022\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of a drug candidate, even if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nOur ETB therapeutic approach is novel and negative public opinion and increased regulatory scrutiny of ETB-based therapies may damage public perception of the safety of our drug candidates and adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or obtain regulatory approvals for our drug candidates.\nETB therapy remains a novel technology, with no ETB therapy product approved to date in the United States or elsewhere worldwide. Public perception may be influenced by claims that ETB therapy is unsafe, and ETB therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. In particular, our success will depend upon physicians who specialize in the treatment of the diseases targeted by our drug candidates prescribing treatments that involve the use of one or more of our approved drug candidates in lieu of, or in addition to, existing treatments with which they may be familiar and for which more clinical data may be available. More restrictive government regulations or negative public opinion regarding ETB-based drug candidates could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and may delay or impair the development and commercialization of our drug candidates or demand for any products we may develop. Serious adverse events in ETB clinical trials for our competitors\u2019 products, even if not ultimately attributable to the relevant drug candidates, and the resulting publicity, could result in increased government regulation, unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our drug candidates, stricter labeling requirements for those drug candidates that are approved and a decrease in demand for any such drug candidates.\nProduct development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier preclinical studies and clinical trials may not be predictive of future clinical trial results.\nWe currently have no products approved for sale and we cannot guarantee that we will ever have marketable products. Clinical testing is expensive and generally takes many years to complete, and the outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical development process. Clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we or any future collaboration partners may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or preclinical studies. We will be required to demonstrate with substantial evidence through well-controlled clinical trials that our drug candidates are safe and effective for use in a diverse population before we can seek marketing approvals for their commercial sale. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our drug candidates may not be predictive of the results of larger, later-stage controlled clinical trials. Drug candidates that have shown promising results in early-stage clinical trials may still suffer significant setbacks or failure in subsequent clinical trials. Our clinical trials to date have been conducted on a small number of patients in limited numbers of clinical trial sites for a limited number of indications. We will have to conduct larger, well-controlled trials in our proposed indications to verify the results obtained to date and to support any regulatory submissions for further clinical development. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks or failure in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles despite promising results in earlier, smaller clinical trials. In particular, no ETB-based drug candidates have been approved or commercialized in any jurisdiction, and the outcome of our preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later-stage clinical trials.\nFrom time to time, we may publish or report interim or preliminary data from our clinical trials. Interim or preliminary data from clinical trials that we may conduct may not be indicative of the final results of the trial and are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Interim or preliminary data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the interim or preliminary data. As a result, interim or preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available.\nIn some instances, there can be significant variability in safety and efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same drug candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial protocols, differences in size and type of the patient populations, differences in and adherence to the dosing regimen and other trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. We therefore do not know whether any clinical trials we may conduct will demonstrate consistent or adequate efficacy and safety sufficient to obtain marketing approval to market our drug candidates.\nWe may use our financial and human resources to pursue a particular research program or drug candidate and fail to capitalize on programs or drug candidates that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and human resources, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with certain programs or drug candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or more profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and future drug candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. We may also enter into additional strategic collaboration agreements to develop and commercialize some of our programs and potential drug candidates in indications with potentially large commercial markets. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular drug candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that drug candidate through strategic collaborations, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such drug candidate, or we may allocate internal resources to a drug candidate in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a partnering arrangement.\nWe may face potential product liability, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability and costs. If the use or misuse of our drug candidates harms patients or is perceived to harm patients even when such harm is unrelated to our drug candidates, we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims. If we are unable to obtain adequate insurance or are required to pay for liabilities resulting from a claim excluded from, or beyond the limits of, our insurance coverage, a material liability claim could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe use or misuse of our drug candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any products for which we may obtain marketing approval exposes us to the risk of potential product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our drug candidates and approved products, if any. There is a risk that our drug candidates may induce adverse events. If we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liability and costs. Some of our ETB drug candidates have shown in clinical trials to induce adverse events, including anemia, diarrhea, nausea, stomatitis, asthenia, fatigue, peripheral edema, pyrexia, pneumonia, hypoalbuminemia, hypokalemia, arthralgia, myalgia, headache, insomnia, cough, dyspnea, rash, and hypotension, among others. There is a risk that our future drug candidates may induce similar or more severe adverse events. Patients with the diseases targeted by our drug candidates may already be in severe or advanced stages of disease and have both known and unknown significant preexisting and potentially life-threatening health risks. During the course of treatment, patients may suffer adverse events, including death, for reasons that may be related to our drug candidates. Such events could subject us to costly litigation, require us to pay substantial amounts of money to injured patients, delay, negatively impact or end our opportunity to receive or maintain regulatory approval to market our products, or require us to suspend or abandon our commercialization efforts. Even in a circumstance in which an adverse event is unrelated to our drug candidates, the investigation into the circumstance may be time-consuming or inconclusive. These investigations may delay our regulatory approval process or impact and limit the type of regulatory approvals our drug candidates receive or maintain. As a result of these factors, a product liability claim, even if successfully defended, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAlthough we have product liability insurance covering our clinical trials in the United States for up to $7.0 million per occurrence up to an aggregate limit of $7.0 million, our insurance may be insufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. We also will likely be required to increase our product liability insurance coverage for the advanced clinical trials that we plan to initiate. If we obtain marketing approval for any of our drug candidates, we will need to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products. There is no way to know if we will be able to continue to obtain product liability coverage and obtain expanded coverage if we require it, in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability, on acceptable terms, or at all. We may not have sufficient resources to pay for any liabilities resulting from a claim excluded from, or beyond the limits of, our insurance coverage. Where we have provided indemnities in favor of third parties under our agreements with them, there is also a risk that these third parties could incur liability and bring a claim under such indemnities. An individual may bring a product liability claim against us alleging that one of our drug candidates causes, or is claimed to have caused, an injury or is found to be unsuitable for consumer use. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability and breach of warranties. Claims also could be asserted under state consumer protection acts. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in:\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial volunteers, investigators, patients or trial sites or limitations on approved indications;\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize, or if commercialized, decreased demand for, our drug candidates;\n\u2022\nif commercialized, product recalls, withdrawals of labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions or the need for product modification;\n\u2022\ninitiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u2022\nloss of revenues;\n\u2022\nsubstantial costs of litigation, including monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u2022\nliabilities that substantially exceed our product liability insurance, which we would then be required to pay;\n\u2022\nan increase in our product liability insurance rates or the inability to maintain insurance coverage in the future on acceptable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from our business; and\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation and the reputation of our products and our technology.\nProduct liability claims may subject us to the foregoing and other risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nBiologics carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a negative impact on future results of operations.\nThe successful discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics. For example, access to and supply of necessary biological materials, such as cell lines, may be limited and governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials. In addition, the development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. Manufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies. Such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures. Biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material, and some biologics cannot be made synthetically. Failure to successfully discover, develop, manufacture and sell our biological drug candidates would adversely impact our business and future results of operations.\nOur international activities, including clinical trials abroad, expose us to various risks, any number of which could harm our business.\nWe are subject to the risks inherent in engaging in business across national boundaries, due in part to our clinical trials abroad, any one of which could adversely impact our business. In addition to currency fluctuations, these risks include, among other things: economic downturns; changes in or interpretations of local law, governmental policy or regulation; restrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of the country; varying tax systems; and government protectionism. One or more of the foregoing factors could impair our current or future operations and, as a result, harm our overall business.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in changes in our reported financial results.\nWe currently incur significant expenses denominated in foreign currencies, specifically in connection with our clinical trial sites, several of which are located in various countries outside of the United States. These clinical trial sites invoice us in the local currency of the site. As we expand internationally, our exposure to currency risks will increase. We do not manage our foreign currency exposure in a manner that would eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. Therefore, changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar will affect our revenues and expenses and could result in exchange losses in any given reporting period. We incur currency transaction risks whenever we enter into either a purchase or a sale transaction using a currency other than the dollar, our functional currency, particularly in our arrangements for the purchase of supplies or licensing and collaboration agreements with partners outside of the United States. We do not engage in foreign currency hedging arrangements for our accounts payable, and, consequently, foreign currency fluctuations may adversely affect our earnings. We may decide to manage this risk by hedging our foreign currency exposure, principally through derivative contracts. Even if we decide to enter into such hedging transactions, we cannot be sure that such hedges will be effective or that the costs of such hedges will not exceed their benefits. Given the volatility of exchange rates, we can give no assurance that we will be able to effectively manage our currency transaction risks or that any volatility in currency exchange rates will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business activities may be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws of other countries in which we operate.\nWe have conducted and have ongoing studies in international locations, and may in the future initiate additional studies in countries other than the United States. Our business activities may be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate. The FCPA generally prohibits offering, promising, giving or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to influence official action or otherwise obtain or retain business. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with public officials, including officials of non-U.S. governments. Additionally, in many other countries, the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their governments, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. Recently the SEC and Department of Justice have increased their FCPA enforcement activities with respect to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. There is no certainty that all of our employees, agents or contractors, or those of our affiliates, will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, particularly given the high level of complexity of these laws. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, the closing down of our facilities, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products, if approved, in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees and our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of Our Drug Candidates and Other Legal Compliance Matters\nA potential breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA for our drug candidates may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and it does not increase the likelihood that our drug candidates will receive marketing approval.\nWe may seek a breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA for one or more of our drug candidates. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biological product that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biological product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For drugs or biological products that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of a clinical trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. Drugs or biologic products designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA could also be eligible for accelerated approval.\nDesignation as a breakthrough therapy is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe one of our drug candidates meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. In any event, the receipt of a breakthrough therapy designation for a drug candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional or other accelerated FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more of our drug candidates qualify and are designated as breakthrough therapies, the FDA may later decide that the drugs or biological products no longer meet the conditions for designation and the designation may be rescinded.\nWe may seek Fast Track designation for one or more of our drug candidates, but we might not receive such designation, and even if we do, such designation may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\nIf a drug candidate is intended for the treatment of a serious condition and nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need for this condition, a product sponsor may apply for FDA Fast Track designation. If we seek Fast Track designation for a drug candidate, we may not receive it from the FDA. However, even if we receive Fast Track designation, Fast Track designation does not ensure that we will receive marketing approval or that approval will be granted within any particular time frame. We may not experience a faster development or regulatory review or approval process with Fast Track designation compared to conventional FDA procedures. In addition, the FDA may withdraw Fast Track designation if the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program. Fast Track designation alone does not guarantee qualification for the FDA\u2019s priority review procedures.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for a product, we will remain subject to ongoing regulatory requirements. Maintaining compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements may result in significant additional expense to us, and any failure to maintain such compliance could subject us to penalties and cause our business to suffer.\nIf any of our drug candidates are approved, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements with respect to manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping, conduct of post-marketing clinical trials and submission of safety, efficacy and other post-approval information, including both federal and state requirements in the United States and requirements of comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nManufacturers and manufacturers\u2019 facilities are required to continuously comply with FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authority requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP regulations and corresponding foreign regulatory manufacturing requirements. As such, we and our CMOs will be subject to continual review and inspections to assess compliance with cGMP and adherence to commitments made in any BLA, NDA or other marketing authorization application.\nAny regulatory approvals that we receive for our drug candidates may be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the drug candidate may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase IV clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate. In addition, if the FDA, EMA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority approves any of our drug candidates, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and record keeping for the products will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. Any new legislation addressing drug safety issues could result in delays in product development or commercialization, or increased costs to assure compliance. If our original marketing approval for a drug candidate was obtained through an accelerated approval pathway, we could be required to conduct a successful post-marketing clinical trial in order to confirm the clinical benefit for our products. An unsuccessful post-marketing clinical trial or failure to complete such a trial could result in the withdrawal of marketing approval.\nWe must also comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for any of our drug candidates for which we hope to obtain marketing approval. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs and biologics are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved labeling. If we are not able to comply with post-approval regulatory requirements, we could have marketing approval for any of our products withdrawn by regulatory authorities and our ability to market any future products could be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve or sustain profitability. Thus, the cost of compliance with post-approval regulations may have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, or failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in a variety of risks. For example, a regulatory agency or enforcement authority may, among other things:\n\u2022\nimpose restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;\n\u2022\nimpose requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nissue warning or untitled letters if the regulator is the FDA, or comparable notice of violations from foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nissue consent decrees, injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022\nrequire the payment of fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n\u2022\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nsuspend any of our ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications submitted by us;\n\u2022\nimpose restrictions on our operations, including closing our CMOs\u2019 facilities; or\n\u2022\nrequire product seizure or detention, recalls or refuse to permit the import or export of products.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law would be expected to require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate adverse publicity. Any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our products and our value and our operating results would be adversely affected. In addition, regulatory authorities\u2019 policies (such as those of the FDA or EMA) may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our drug candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are otherwise not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained, which would adversely affect our business, prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur commercial success will depend upon attaining significant market acceptance of our drug candidates, if approved, among physicians, patients, third-party payors and other members of the medical community.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates, the approved products may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance among physicians, third-party payors, patients and other members of the medical community, which is critical to commercial success. If an approved product does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues or any profits from operations. The degree of market acceptance of any drug candidate for which we receive approval depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments or competitive products;\n\u2022\nperceptions by the medical community, physicians, and patients, regarding the safety and effectiveness of our products and the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u2022\nthe size of the market for such drug candidate, based on the size of the patient subsets that we are targeting, in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval and have commercial rights;\n\u2022\nthe safety of the drug candidate as demonstrated through broad commercial distribution;\n\u2022\nthe ability to offer our drug candidates for sale at competitive prices;\n\u2022\nthe availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing for our products from governmental health programs and other third-party payors;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\ncost-effectiveness of our product relative to competing products;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022\nthe adequacy of supply of our drug candidates;\n\u2022\nthe timing of any such marketing approval in relation to other product approvals;\n\u2022\nany restrictions on concomitant use of other medications;\n\u2022\nsupport from patient advocacy groups; and\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of sales, marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any.\nIf our drug candidates are approved but fail to achieve an adequate level of acceptance by key market participants, we will not be able to generate significant revenues, and we may not become or remain profitable, which may require us to seek additional financing.\nOur ability to negotiate, secure and maintain third-party coverage and reimbursement for our drug candidates may be affected by political, economic and regulatory developments in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions. Governments continue to impose cost containment measures, and third-party payors are increasingly challenging prices charged for medicines and examining their cost effectiveness, in addition to their safety and efficacy. These and other similar developments could significantly limit the degree of market acceptance of any drug candidate of ours that receives marketing approval in the future.\nHealthcare legislative reform measures may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, was passed. The ACA is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of health care spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for health care and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.\nBoth members of Congress and President Trump have expressed an intention to repeal or repeal and replace the ACA, and as a result certain sections of the ACA have not been fully implemented or have been effectively repealed through Executive Orders and/or executive agency actions. In addition, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals recently upheld a federal district court decision finding the individual insurance mandate in the ACA to be unconstitutional. The Fifth Circuit also reversed and remanded the case to the district court to determine if other reforms enacted as part of the ACA, but not specifically related to the individual mandate or health insurance, could be severed from the rest of the ACA so that the entire law would not be declared invalid. It is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals including potentially to the U.S. Supreme Court, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will affect the implementation of that law and our business. The uncertainty around the future of the ACA, and in particular the impact to reimbursement levels, may lead to uncertainty or delay in the purchasing decisions of our customers, which may in turn negatively impact our product sales. If there are not adequate reimbursement levels, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn the United States and in some other jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the health care system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our drug candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, or affect our ability to profitably sell any drug candidates for which we obtain marketing approval, if any. Further, increased scrutiny by the US Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process for drugs and biological products may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. There also are a number of state and local legislative and regulatory efforts related to drug pricing, including drug price transparency laws that apply to pharmaceutical manufacturers, that may have an impact on our business.\nIn addition, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act enacted in 2013 imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing, and that law is expected to be fully implemented over a ten-year period. Most recently, on December 20, 2019, President Trump signed the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2020 into law (P.L. 116-94) that includes a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples Act of 2019 or the \u201cCREATES Act.\u201d The CREATES Act aims to address the concern articulated by both the FDA and others in the industry that some brand manufacturers have improperly restricted the distribution of their products, including by invoking the existence of a REMS for certain products, to deny generic and biosimilar product developers access to samples of brand products. The CREATES Act establishes a private cause of action that permits a generic or biosimilar product developer to sue the brand manufacturer to compel it to furnish the necessary samples on\n\u201ccommercially reasonable, market-based terms.\u201d Whether and how generic and biosimilar product developments will use this new pathway, as well as the likely outcome of any legal challenges to provisions of the CREATES Act, remain highly uncertain and its potential effects on our future commercial products are unknown. Other legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals, if any, of our drug candidates, may be or whether such changes will have any other impacts on our business. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing conditions and other requirements.\nIn the European Union, similar political, economic and regulatory developments may affect our ability to profitably commercialize our products. In addition to continuing pressure on prices and cost containment measures, legislative developments at the European Union or EU member state level may result in significant additional requirements or obstacles that may increase our operating costs.\nWe expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria, lower reimbursement and additional downward pressure on the price that we will receive for any approved product. Any reduction in payments from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products.\nOur relationships with prescribers, purchasers, third-party payors and patients will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other health care laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nIf we obtain FDA approval for any of our drug candidates and begin commercializing those products in the United States, our operations will be subject to additional health care statutory and regulatory requirements and oversight by federal and state governments in the United States as well as foreign governments in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Physicians, other health care providers and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation, prescription and use of any drug candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. In the U.S., our future arrangements with such third parties may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other health care laws and regulations that may constrain our business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any products for which we may obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable domestic and foreign health care laws and regulations include but are not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase order or recommendation of a good or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u2022\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the U.S. False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; actions may be brought by the government or a whistleblower and may include an assertion that a claim for payment by federal health care programs for items and services which results from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statue constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;\n\u2022\nthe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, that imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services; similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u2022\nanalogous state and foreign laws and regulations relating to health care fraud and abuse, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving health care items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers;\n\u2022\nthe federal physician payment transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the \u201cSunshine Act,\u201d enacted as part of the ACA, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program to report annually to CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals (and, beginning in 2021, for transfers of value to other health care providers), as well as the ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations;\n\u2022\nanalogous state and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to track, report and disclose to the government and/or the public information related to payments, gifts, and other transfers of value or remuneration to physicians and other health care providers, marketing activities or expenditures, or product pricing or transparency information, or that require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs that meet certain standards or to restrict or limit interactions between pharmaceutical manufacturers and members of the health care industry;\n\u2022\nthe U.S. federal laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to government authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under federal health care programs;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, which imposes obligations on certain covered entity health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and\n\u2022\nstate and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable health care laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority approves any of our drug candidates, we will be subject to an expanded number of these laws and regulations and will need to expend resources to develop and implement policies and processes to promote ongoing compliance. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other health care laws and regulations, resulting in government enforcement actions. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nWe may be subject to, or may in the future become subject to, U.S. federal and state, and foreign laws and regulations imposing obligations on how we collect, use, disclose, store and process personal information. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could result in liability or reputational harm and could harm our business. Ensuring compliance with such laws could also impair our efforts to maintain and expand our customer base, and thereby decrease our revenue.\nIn many activities, including the conduct of clinical trials, we may be subject to laws and regulations governing data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. These laws and regulations govern our processing of personal data, including the collection, access, use, analysis, modification, storage, transfer, security breach notification, destruction and disposal of personal data.\nThe privacy and security of personally identifiable information stored, maintained, received or transmitted, including electronically, is subject to significant regulation in the United States and abroad. While we strive to comply with all applicable privacy and security laws and regulations, legal standards for privacy continue to evolve and any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, or could cause reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nNumerous foreign, federal and state laws and regulations govern collection, dissemination, use and confidentiality of personally identifiable health information, including state privacy and confidentiality laws (including state laws requiring disclosure of breaches), federal and state consumer protection and employment laws; HIPAA and European and other foreign data protection laws. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, and may change frequently and sometimes conflict. The European Union\u2019s omnibus data protection law, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, took effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR imposes numerous requirements on entities that process personal data in the context of an establishment in the European Economic Area, or EEA, or that process the personal data of data subjects who are located in the EEA. These requirements include, for example, establishing a basis for processing, providing notice to data subjects, developing procedures to vindicate expanded data subject rights, implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard personal data, and complying with restrictions on the cross-border transfer of personal data from the EEA to countries that the European Union does not consider to have in place adequate data protection legislation, such as the United States. The GDPR additionally establishes heightened obligations for entities that process \u201cspecial categories\u201d of personal data, such as health data. Nearly all clinical trials involve the processing of these \u201cspecial categories\u201d of personal data, and thus processing of personal data collected during the course of clinical trials is subject to heightened protections under the GDPR. Violations of the GDPR can lead to penalties of up to $20 million or 4% of an entity\u2019s annual turnover.\nAs a means to transfer personal data from the EEA to the US, US-based companies may certify compliance with the privacy principles of the EU-US Privacy Shield, or the Privacy Shield. Certification to the Privacy Shield, however, is not mandatory. If a US-based company does not certify compliance with the Privacy Shield, it may rely on other authorized mechanisms to transfer personal data. Notably, the Privacy Shield is currently subject to challenge in the EU courts, and it is possible that it will be invalidated, which was the fate of its predecessor, the EU-US Safe Harbor. In the event of invalidation of the Privacy Shield, US companies that currently rely on the Privacy Shield as the basis for cross-border transfer of personal data will need to establish another basis for cross-border transfer of personal data.\nHIPAA establishes a set of national privacy and security standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information, including protected health information, or PHI, by health plans, certain health care clearinghouses and health care providers that submit certain covered transactions electronically, or covered entities, and their \u201cbusiness associates,\u201d which are persons or entities that perform certain services for, or on behalf of, a covered entity that involve creating, receiving, maintaining or transmitting PHI. While we are not currently a covered entity or business associate under HIPAA, we may receive identifiable information from these entities. Failure to receive this information properly could subject us to HIPAA\u2019s criminal penalties, which may include fines up to $250,000 per violation and/or imprisonment. In addition, responding to government investigations regarding alleged violations of these and other laws and regulations, even if ultimately concluded with no findings of violations or no penalties imposed, can consume company resources and impact our business and, if public, harm our reputation.\nIn addition, various states, such as California and Massachusetts, have implemented similar privacy laws and regulations, such as the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, that impose restrictive requirements regulating the use and disclosure of health information and other personally identifiable information. In addition to fines and penalties imposed upon violators, some of these state laws also afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. California\u2019s patient privacy laws, for example, provide for penalties of up to $250,000 and permit injured parties to sue for damages. In addition to the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, California also recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, which is effective January 1, 2020. The CCPA has been characterized as the first \u201cGDPR-like\u201d privacy statute to be enacted in the United States because it mirrors a number of the key provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation. The CCPA establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses in the State of California, by creating an expanded definition of personal information, establishing new data privacy rights for consumers, imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, and creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches.\nThe interplay of federal and state laws may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability. Further, as regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and laws and regulations concerning the protection of personal information expand and become more complex, these potential risks to our business could intensify. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data security continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data security issues which may affect our business. Failure to comply with current and future laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (including the imposition of significant penalties), criminal and/or civil liability for us and our officers and directors, private litigation and/or adverse publicity that negatively affects our business.\nReliance on government funding for our programs may add uncertainty to our research and commercialization efforts with respect to those programs that are tied to such funding and may impose requirements that limit our ability to take certain actions, increase the costs of commercialization and production of drug candidates developed under those programs and subject us to potential financial penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring the course of our development of our lead drug candidate, we have been funded in significant part through state grants, including but not limited to the substantial funding we have received from the Cancer Prevention & Research Institute of Texas, or CPRIT. We entered our first CPRIT award grant contract, or the 2011 CPRIT Agreement, on December 1, 2011. On September 18, 2018, we entered into a second CPRIT award grant contract for our CD38 targeted ETB program, or the 2018 CPRIT CD38 Agreement, which was extended in November 2019. In addition to the funding we have received to date, we have applied and intend to continue to apply for federal and state grants to receive additional funding in the future, which may or may not be successful. Contracts and grants funded by the U.S. government, state governments and their related agencies, including our contracts with the State of Texas pertaining to funds we have already received, include provisions that reflect the government\u2019s substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including powers of the government to:\n\u2022\nrequire repayment of all or a portion of the grant proceeds, in certain cases with interest, in the event we violate certain covenants pertaining to various matters that include any potential relocation outside of the State of Texas, failure to achieve certain milestones or to comply with terms relating to use of grant proceeds, or failure to comply with certain laws;\n\u2022\nterminate agreements, in whole or in part, for any reason or no reason;\n\u2022\nreduce or modify the government\u2019s obligations under such agreements without the consent of the other party;\n\u2022\nclaim rights, including march-in and other intellectual property rights, in products and data developed under such agreements;\n\u2022\naudit contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs;\n\u2022\nsuspend the contractor or grantee from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nimpose the State of Texas or U.S. manufacturing requirements for products that embody inventions conceived or first reduced to practice under such agreements;\n\u2022\nimpose the qualifications for the engagement of manufacturers, suppliers and other contractors as well as other criteria for reimbursements;\n\u2022\nsuspend or debar the contractor or grantee from doing future business with the government;\n\u2022\ncontrol and potentially prohibit the export of products;\n\u2022\npursue criminal or civil remedies under the False Claims Act, False Statements Act and similar remedy provisions specific to government agreements; and\n\u2022\nlimit the government\u2019s financial liability to amounts appropriated by the State of Texas on a fiscal-year basis, thereby leaving some uncertainty about the future availability of funding for a program even after it has been funded for an initial period.\nIn addition to those powers set forth above, the government funding we may receive could also impose requirements to make payments based upon sales of our products in the future. For example, under the terms of our 2018 CPRIT CD38 Agreement, we are required to pay CPRIT a percentage of our revenues from sales of products directly funded by CPRIT, or received from our licensees or sub licensees, at a percentage in the low to mid-single digits until the aggregate amount of such payments equals 400% of the funds we receive from CPRIT, and thereafter at a rate of one-half percent.\nWe may not have the right to prohibit the State of Texas or, if relevant under possible future federal grants, the U.S. government, from using certain technologies developed by us, and we may not be able to prohibit third-party companies, including our competitors, from using those technologies in providing products and services to the U.S. government. The U.S. government generally takes the position that it has the right to royalty-free use of technologies that are developed under U.S. government contracts. These and other provisions of government grants may also apply to intellectual property we license now or in the future.\nIn addition, government contracts and grants normally contain additional requirements that may increase our costs of doing business, reduce our profits and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these requirements. These requirements include, for example:\n\u2022\nspecialized accounting systems unique to government contracts and grants;\n\u2022\nmandatory financial audits and potential liability for price adjustments or recoupment of government funds after such funds have been spent;\n\u2022\npublic disclosures of certain contract and grant information, which may enable competitors to gain insights into our research program; and\n\u2022\nmandatory socioeconomic compliance requirements, including labor standards, non-discrimination and affirmative action programs and environmental compliance requirements.\nIf we fail to maintain compliance with any such requirements that may apply to us now or in the future, we may be subject to potential liability and to termination of our contracts.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur research and development activities and our third-party manufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 activities involve the controlled storage, use, and disposal of hazardous materials, including the components of our drug candidates and other hazardous compounds. We and our manufacturers and suppliers are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of these hazardous materials. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our and our manufacturers\u2019 facilities pending their use and disposal. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations; environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up; and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling, and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although we believe that the safety procedures utilized by us and our third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that this is the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources and state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of specified materials and/or interrupt our business operations. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance. We do not currently carry biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage.\nInadequate funding for the FDA, the SEC and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent our drug candidates from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business rely, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of the SEC and other government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs and biologic products to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, the U.S. government has shut down several times, including from December 22, 2018 through January 25, 2019, and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the SEC, have had to furlough critical FDA, SEC and other government employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly affect the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, in our operations as a public company, future government shutdowns could impact our ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur ability to compete effectively may decline if we are unable to establish intellectual property rights or if our intellectual property rights are inadequate to protect our ETB technology, present and future drug candidates and related processes for our developmental pipeline.\nWe rely or will rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection, and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property related to our technologies and drug candidates. Our commercial success and viability depend in large part on our and any current and potential future licensors or collaboration partners\u2019 ability to obtain, maintain and enforce patent and other intellectual property protections in the United States, Europe and other countries worldwide with respect to our current and future proprietary technologies and drug candidates. If we or our current or future licensors or collaboration partners do not adequately protect such intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could materially harm our business, negatively affect our position in the marketplace, limit our ability to commercialize drug candidates and delay or render impossible our achievement of profitability.\nOur strategy and future prospects are based, in part, on our patent portfolio. We and our current and future licensors or collaboration partners or licensees will best be able to protect our proprietary ETB technologies, drug candidates and their uses from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable patents, other regulatory exclusivities or effectively protected trade secrets, cover them. We have sought to protect our proprietary position by filing in the United States and elsewhere patent applications related to our proprietary ETB technologies, drug candidates and methods of use that are important to our business. This process is expensive and time consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain meaningful patent protection.\nIntellectual property rights have limitations and do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage. Our ability to obtain patent protection for our proprietary technologies, drug candidates and their uses is uncertain, and the degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nwe or our current or future collaboration partners may not have been the first to make the inventions covered by pending patent applications or issued patents;\n\u2022\nwe or our current or future licensors or collaboration partners may not have been the first to file patent applications covering our ETB technology, drug candidates, compositions or their uses;\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop identical, similar or alternative methods, products, drug candidates or compositions and uses thereof;\n\u2022\nwe or our current or future licensors or collaboration partners\u2019 disclosures in patent applications may not be sufficient to meet the statutory requirements for patentability;\n\u2022\nany or all of our or our current or future licensors or collaboration partners\u2019 pending patent applications may not result in issued patents;\n\u2022\nwe or our current or future licensors or collaboration partners may not seek or obtain patent protection in countries that may eventually provide us with a significant business opportunity;\n\u2022\nany patents issued to us or our current or future licensors or collaboration partners may not provide a basis for commercially viable products, may not provide any competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties;\n\u2022\nwe or our current or future licensors or collaboration partners\u2019 products, drug candidates, compositions, methods or uses thereof may not be patentable;\n\u2022\nothers may design around our or our current or future licensors or collaboration partners\u2019 patent claims to produce competitive products or uses which fall outside of the scope of our patents or other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nothers may identify prior art or other bases which could invalidate our or our current or future licensors or collaboration partners\u2019 patents;\n\u2022\nour competitors might conduct research and development activities in the United States and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for certain research and development activities, as well as in countries where we or our current or future licensors or collaboration partners do not have patent rights, and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in major commercial markets; or\n\u2022\nwe or our current or future licensors or collaboration partners may not develop additional proprietary technologies or products that are patentable.\nFurther, the patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions for which legal principles remain unsettled. The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover our or our competitors\u2019 drug candidates or their uses in the United States or in other countries. There is no assurance that all potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found, which can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application. Even if patents do successfully issue, and even if such patents cover our drug candidates or their uses, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability or scope, which may result in such patents being narrowed, found unenforceable or invalidated. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property, provide exclusivity for our drug candidates or prevent others from designing around our claims. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe, independently or together with our collaboration partners, have filed several patent applications covering various aspects of our ETB technology, drug candidates and associated assays and uses. We cannot offer any assurances about which, if any, patents will issue, the breadth of any such patent or whether any issued patents will be found invalid and unenforceable or will be threatened by third parties. Any successful opposition or challenge to these patents or any other patents owned by or licensed to us after patent issuance could deprive us of rights necessary for the successful commercialization of any drug candidates that we may develop. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market a drug candidate under patent protection could be reduced.\nIf we cannot obtain and maintain effective protection of exclusivity from our regulatory efforts and intellectual property rights, including patent protection or data or market exclusivity for our drug candidates or their uses, we may not be able to compete effectively, and our business and results of operations would be harmed.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on drug candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop our own products and may also export infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly some developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to healthcare, medicine, or biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our resources, efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nWe may not have sufficient patent terms and regulatory exclusivity protections for our drug candidates to effectively protect our competitive position.\nPatents have a limited term. In the United States and most jurisdictions worldwide, the statutory expiration of a non-provisional patent is generally 20 years after it is first filed. Although various extensions may be available, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our technologies, drug candidates and associated uses are obtained, once the patent\u2019s life has expired, including for failure to pay maintenance fees or annuities, we may be open to competition from generic, biosimilar or biobetter medications.\nPatent term extensions under the Hatch-Waxman Act in the United States, and regulatory extensions in Japan and certain other countries, and under Supplementary Protection Certificates in Europe, may be available to extend the patent or market or data exclusivity terms of our drug candidates depending on the timing and duration of the regulatory review process relative to patent term. In addition, upon issuance of a United States patent, any patent term may be adjusted based on specified delays during patent prosecution caused by the applicant(s) or the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO. Although we will likely seek patent term extensions in the U.S. and in one or more foreign jurisdictions where available, we cannot provide any assurances that any such patent term extensions will be obtained and, if so, for how long. As a result, we may not be able to maintain exclusivity for our drug candidates for an extended period after regulatory approval, if any, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If we do not have sufficient patent terms or regulatory exclusivity to protect our drug candidates, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products, and recent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nAs is the case with other biotechnology companies, our success is heavily dependent on patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biotechnology industry involve both technological and legal complexity, and is therefore costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the United States has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in specified circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in specified situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nFor our U.S. patent applications containing a claim not entitled to benefit or priority of a patent application filed before March 16, 2013, there is a greater level of uncertainty in the patent law. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The USPTO has promulgated regulations and developed procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first inventor to file a provisional patent application, did not come into effect until March 16, 2013. The Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAn important change introduced by the Leahy-Smith Act is that, as of March 16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a \u201cfirst-inventor-to-file\u201d system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. A third party that filed or files a patent application in the USPTO after March 16, 2013 but before we file an application could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by the third party. This will require us to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to filing of a patent application. Furthermore, our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents depends on whether the differences between our technology and the prior art allow our technology to be patentable over the prior art. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we were the first to either (i) file any patent application related to our drug candidates or (ii) invent any of the inventions claimed in our patents or patent applications.\nAmong some of the other changes introduced by the Leahy-Smith Act are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and new procedures providing opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO. Included in these new procedures is a process known as inter partes review, or IPR, which has been generally used by many third parties to invalidate patents. The IPR process is not limited to patents filed after the Leahy-Smith Act was enacted and would therefore be available to a third party seeking to invalidate any of our U.S. patents, even those issued or filed before March 16, 2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in U.S. federal court necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures, e.g., an IPR, to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party in a district court action.\nWe could be required to incur significant expenses to obtain our intellectual property rights, and we cannot ensure that we will obtain meaningful patent protection for our drug candidates.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. In addition, it is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of further inventions made in the course of our development and commercialization activities before they are publicly disclosed, making it too late to obtain patent protection on them. Further, given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new drug candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. We expect to seek extensions of patent terms where these are available in any countries where we are prosecuting patents. This includes in the United States under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, which permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of a patent that covers an approved product where the permission for the commercial marketing or use of the product is the first permitted commercial marketing or use, and as long as the remaining term of the patent does not exceed 14 years. However, the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, and any regulatory authority in other countries, may not agree with our assessment of whether such extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents, or may grant more limited extensions than we request. If this occurs, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our investment in development and clinical trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and these foreign laws may also be subject to change. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions.\nIssued patents covering our ETB technologies, drug candidates and uses could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in a patent office or court.\nEven if our or our current or future collaboration partners\u2019 patents do successfully issue and even if such patents cover our drug candidates and methods of use, third parties may initiate interference, re-examination, post-grant review, IPR or derivation actions in the USPTO; may initiate third party oppositions in the European Patent Office, or EPO; or may initiate similar actions challenging the validity, enforceability or scope of such patents in other patent administrative proceedings worldwide, which may result in patent claims being narrowed or invalidated. Such proceedings could result in revocation or amendment of our patents in such a way that they no longer cover competitive technologies, drug candidates or methods of use. Further, if we initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering our technologies, drug candidates or uses, the defendant could counterclaim that our relevant patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, certain European and other countries worldwide, it is commonplace for defendants to make counterclaims alleging invalidity and unenforceability in the same proceeding, or to commence parallel defensive proceedings such as patent nullity actions to challenge validity and enforceability of asserted patent claims. Further, in the United States, a third party, including a licensee of one of our or our current or future collaboration partners\u2019 patents, may initiate legal proceedings against us in which the third party challenges the validity, enforceability, or scope of our patent(s).\nIn administrative and court actions, grounds for a patent validity challenge may include alleged failures to meet any of several statutory requirements, including novelty, nonobviousness (or inventive step), clarity, adequate written description and enablement of the claimed invention. Grounds for unenforceability assertions include allegations that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the Examiner during prosecution in the USPTO or made a misleading statement during prosecution in the USPTO, the EPO or elsewhere. Third parties also may raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the USPTO or the EPO, even outside the context of litigation. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity or unenforceability are unpredictable. With respect to patent claim validity, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we or the patent examiner was unaware during prosecution. Further, we cannot be certain that all of the potentially relevant art relating to our patents and patent applications has been brought to the attention of every patent office. If a defendant or other patent challenger were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we could lose at least in part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our ETB technology, drug candidates and associated uses.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful and have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of any of our future licensors. If we or one of our collaboration partners were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our drug candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our drug candidate is invalid and/or unenforceable. In addition, a third party might initiate legal proceedings against us alleging that our patent covering one or more of our drug candidates is invalid and/or unenforceable. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including novelty, nonobviousness, adequate written description, clarity or enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable.\nThere is also a risk that, even if the validity of such patents is upheld, the court will construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly, for example, such that they don\u2019t cover our drug candidates, or decide that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the claimed invention at issue on the grounds that our or our current or future collaboration partners\u2019 patent claims do not cover the claimed invention. Third parties may in the future make claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our intellectual property. An adverse outcome in a litigation or proceeding involving one or more of our patents could limit our ability to assert those patents against those parties or other competitors and may curtail or preclude our ability to exclude third parties from making and selling similar or competitive products. Similarly, if we assert trademark infringement claims, a court may determine that the marks we have asserted are invalid or unenforceable, or that the party against whom we have asserted trademark infringement has superior rights to the marks in question. In this case, we could ultimately be forced to cease use of such trademarks.\nEven if we were to establish infringement of our patent rights by a third party, the court may decide not to grant an injunction against further infringing activity and instead award only monetary damages, which may or may not be an adequate remedy. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to file, pursue or maintain such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are concluded and can involve substantial expenses. Even if we ultimately prevail in such claims, the monetary cost of such litigation and the diversion of the attention of our management and scientific personnel could outweigh any benefit we receive as a result of the proceedings.\nInterference or derivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us or declared by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority or inventorship of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of any of our future licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our defense of litigation, interference proceedings, or derivation proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation and administrative proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our research programs, license necessary technology from third parties or enter into development partnerships that would help us bring our drug candidates to market.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets and know-how for our drug candidates or any future drug candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively in our proposed markets.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable or that we elect not to patent, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our drug candidate discovery and development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and other third parties. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.\nAlthough our current employment contracts provide for and we expect all of our employees and consultants to assign their inventions to us, and although all of our employees, consultants, advisors, and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology are expected to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed or that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets could impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating trade secrets.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement could result in costly litigation or other proceedings and may prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts.\nOur research and development activities and commercial success depends in part on our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our drug candidates and use our proprietary technology without infringing the patent rights of third parties. Third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. We are currently not aware of U.S. or foreign patents or pending patent applications that are owned solely by one or more third parties and that cover our ETB drug candidates or therapeutic uses of those ETB drug candidates. In the future, we may identify such third-party U.S. and non-U.S. issued patents and pending applications. If we identify any such patents or pending applications, we may in the future pursue available proceedings in the U.S. and foreign patent offices to challenge the validity of these patents and patent applications. In addition, or alternatively, we may consider whether to seek to negotiate a license of rights to technology covered by one or more of such patents and patent applications. If any patents or patent applications cover our drug candidates or technologies or a requisite manufacturing process, we may not be free to manufacture or market our drug candidates, including MT-3724, as planned, absent such a license, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nIt is also possible that we have failed to identify relevant third-party patents or applications. For example, patent applications filed before November 29, 2000 and patent applications filed after that date, but that will not be filed outside the United States, remain confidential until the patent applications issue as patents. Moreover, it is difficult for industry participants, including us, to identify all third-party patent rights that may be relevant to drug candidates and technologies because patent searching is imperfect due to differences in terminology among patents, incomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the meaning of patent claims. We may fail to identify relevant patents or patent applications or may identify pending patent applications of potential interest but incorrectly predict the likelihood that such patent applications may issue with claims of relevance to our technology. In addition, we may be unaware of one or more issued patents that would be infringed by the manufacture, sale or use of a current or future drug candidate, or we may incorrectly conclude that a patent office or court would determine that a third-party patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed by our activities. Additionally, pending patent applications that have been published can, subject to specified limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our technologies, our drug candidates or the use of our drug candidates.\nThere have been many lawsuits and other proceedings involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions and reexamination proceedings before the USPTO and corresponding foreign patent offices. Third parties own numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications in the fields in which we are developing drug candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our drug candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties. Parties making patent infringement claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our drug candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, may involve substantial litigation expense and may require a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of patent infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. Further, if we were to seek a license from the third-party holder of any applicable intellectual property rights, we may not be able to obtain the applicable license rights when needed or on reasonable terms, or at all. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation or proceeding more effectively than us due to their substantially greater resources. The occurrence of any of the above events could prevent us from continuing to develop and commercialize one or more of our drug candidates and our business could materially suffer.\nWe may be unsuccessful in obtaining or maintaining third-party intellectual property rights necessary to develop our ETB technologies or to commercialize our drug candidates and associated methods of use through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nPresently, we have intellectual property rights to our ETB technologies under patent applications that we own and to certain CD38 targeting antibody domains through our license agreements. Because our programs may involve a range of ETB targets and antibody domains, which in the future may include targets and antibody domains that require the use of proprietary rights held by third parties, the growth of our business may likely depend in part on our ability to acquire, in-license or use these proprietary rights. In addition, our drug candidates may require specific formulations or manufacturing technologies to work effectively and be manufactured efficiently, and these rights may be held by others. We may be unable to acquire or in-license on reasonable terms any compositions, methods of use, processes or other third-party intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify. The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities.\nFor example, we have previously and may continue to collaborate with federal, state or international academic institutions to accelerate our preclinical research or development under written agreements with these institutions. Typically, these institutions grant the rights to the collaborator and retain a non-commercial license to all rights as well as march-in rights in the situation that the collaborator fails to exercise or commercialize certain covered technologies. Regardless of such initial rights, we may be unable to exercise or commercialize certain funded technologies thereby triggering march-in rights of the funding institution. If we are unable to do so, the institution may offer the intellectual property rights to other parties, potentially blocking our ability to pursue our program.\nIn addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us, and vice versa. We also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to third-party intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition and prospects for growth could suffer.\nIf we are unable to successfully obtain and maintain rights to required third-party intellectual property, we may have to abandon development of that drug candidate or pay additional amounts to the third-party, and our business and financial condition could suffer.\nThe patent protection and patent prosecution for some of our drug candidates may in the future be dependent on third parties.\nWhile we normally seek to gain the right to fully prosecute the patent applications relating to our drug candidates, there may be times when certain patents or patent applications relating to our drug candidates, their uses or their manufacture may be controlled by our collaboration partners. If any of our collaboration partners fail to appropriately or broadly prosecute patent applications and maintain patent protection of claims covering any of our drug candidates, their uses or their manufacture, our ability to develop and commercialize those drug candidates may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using, importing, and selling competing products. In addition, even where we now have the right to control patent prosecution of patent applications or the maintenance of patents we have licensed from third parties, presently or in the future, we may still be adversely affected or prejudiced by actions or inactions of our licensors in effect from actions prior to us assuming control over patent prosecution.\nIf we fail to comply with obligations in the agreements under which we license intellectual property and other rights from third parties or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe are and will continue to be a party to a number of intellectual property license collaboration and supply agreements that may be important to our business and expect to enter into additional license agreements in the future. Our existing agreements impose, and we expect that future agreements will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, purchasing and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements, or we are subject to a bankruptcy, our agreements may be subject to termination by the licensor or other contract party, in which event we would not be able to develop, manufacture or market products covered by the license or subject to supply commitments.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors wrongfully used or disclosed alleged confidential information of third parties or that our employees wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including potential competitors. Although we have written agreements with these individuals, and although we make every effort to ensure that our employees, consultants and independent contractors do not use the proprietary information or intellectual property rights of others in their work for us, we may in the future be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, which could adversely impact our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, documentary, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and to foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent, and periodic annuities are due to be paid for foreign patent applications in some foreign patent offices. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other requirements during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or our licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our drug candidates, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could lead to government enforcement actions, private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nWe are subject to data protection laws and regulations that address privacy and data security. The legislative and regulatory landscape for data protection continues to evolve, and in recent years there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data security issues. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information.\nFailure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions, which could include civil or criminal penalties, private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. In addition, in May 2016, the EU Parliament adopted the comprehensive General Data Privacy Regulation, or the GDPR, to, among other things, impose more stringent data protection requirements for processors and controllers of personal data and provide for greater penalties and fines for non-compliance, including fines in amounts up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide annual turnover, whichever is higher. The GDPR became fully effective in May 2018. In addition, in 2018, California adopted a new privacy law, scheduled to go into effect on January 1, 2020, that borrows heavily from the GDPR. Complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the GDPR and other applicable international and U.S. privacy laws and regulations may result in significant costs to our business and require us to amend certain of our business practices. Further, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase. The future enactment of more restrictive laws, rules or regulations and/or future enforcement actions or investigations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our businesses, and non-compliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, manufacture our drug candidates and perform other services. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected timelines or otherwise conduct the trials as required or perform and comply with regulatory requirements, we may not be able to successfully complete clinical development, obtain regulatory approval or commercialize our drug candidates when expected or at all, and our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon third-party CROs to conduct, monitor and manage our ongoing clinical programs. We rely on these parties for execution of clinical trials and we manage and control only some aspects of their activities. We remain responsible for ensuring that each of our trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs and other vendors are required to comply with all applicable laws, regulations and guidelines, including those required by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our drug candidates in clinical development. If we, or any of our CROs or vendors, fail to comply with applicable laws, regulations and guidelines, the results generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable, and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot be assured that our CROs and other vendors will meet these requirements, or that upon inspection by any regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that efforts, including any of our clinical trials, comply with applicable requirements. Our failure to comply with these laws, regulations and guidelines may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would be costly and delay the regulatory approval process.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party CROs terminates, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs in a timely manner or do so on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, our CROs may not prioritize our clinical trials relative to those of other customers, and any turnover in personnel or delays in the allocation of CRO employees by the CRO may negatively affect our clinical trials. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, our clinical trials may be delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to meet our current plans with respect to our drug candidates. CROs also may involve higher costs than anticipated, which could negatively affect our financial condition and operations.\nWe completed the construction of our cGMP manufacturing facility during the second quarter of 2018 and we have developed the capability to manufacture drug candidates for use in the conduct of our clinical trials. We may not be able to manufacture drug candidates or there may be substantial technical or logistical challenges to supporting manufacturing demand for drug candidates. We may also fail to comply with cGMP requirements and standards which would require us to not utilize the manufacturing facility to make clinical trial supply. We plan to rely in part on third-party manufacturers, and their responsibilities will include purchasing from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce our drug candidates for our clinical trials and regulatory approval. We expect there to be a limited number of suppliers for some of the raw materials that we expect to use to manufacture our drug candidates, and we may not be able to identify alternative suppliers to prevent a possible disruption of the manufacture of our drug candidates for our clinical trials, and, if approved, ultimately for commercial sale.\nAlthough we generally do not expect to begin a clinical trial unless we believe we have a sufficient supply of a drug candidate to complete the trial, any significant delay or discontinuity in the supply of a drug candidate, or the raw materials or other material components in the manufacture of the drug candidate, could delay completion of our clinical trials and potential timing for regulatory approval of our drug candidates, which would harm our business and results of operations. We do not yet have sufficient information to reliably estimate the cost of the commercial manufacturing of our drug candidates and our current costs to manufacture our drug candidates may not be commercially feasible, and the actual cost to manufacture our drug candidates could materially and adversely affect the commercial viability of our drug candidates. As a result, we may never be able to develop a commercially viable product.\nIn addition, our reliance on third-party manufacturers exposes us to the following additional risks:\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to identify manufacturers to manufacture our drug candidates on acceptable terms or at all, because the number of qualified potential manufacturers is limited. Following BLA approval, a change in the manufacturing site could require additional approval from the FDA. This approval would require new testing and compliance inspections;\n\u2022\nour third-party manufacturers might be unable to timely formulate and manufacture our product or produce the quantity and quality required to meet our clinical and commercial needs, if any;\n\u2022\nour future third-party manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials or to successfully produce, store and distribute our drug candidates;\n\u2022\ndrug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMPs and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards, and we do not have control over third-party manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards;\n\u2022\nif any third-party manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for our products, we may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to any improvements made by our third-party manufacturers in the manufacturing process for our drug candidates; and\n\u2022\nour third-party manufacturers could breach or terminate their agreements with us.\nEach of these risks could delay our clinical trials, the approval, if any, of our drug candidates, or the commercialization of our drug candidates or result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenue. In addition, we rely on third parties to perform release testing on our drug candidates prior to delivery to subjects in our clinical trials. If these tests are not appropriately conducted and test data are not reliable, subjects in our clinical trials, or patients treated with our drug candidates, if any are approved in the future, could be put at risk of serious harm, which could result in product liability suits.\nWe depend on Takeda for the conduct and funding of the development and commercialization of CD38 SLT-A Fusion Proteins.\nIn September 2018, we expanded our collaboration with Takeda, focused on the development collaboration of the parties regarding CD38 SLT-A fusion proteins, including TAK-169, by entering into the License Agreement. The primary objective of the strategic alliance is to advance novel therapies for indications associated with oncology, particularly multiple myeloma patients.\nUnder the License Agreement, we granted Takeda an exclusive license to co-develop one or more licensed products, meaning any product that incorporates or is comprised of one or more of the CD38 SLT-A fusion proteins, up to and including Phase Ia clinical trials, and thereafter we would have an option to continue to co-develop the licensed products. We exercised our co-development option in July 2019 and may elect to end our co-development by providing Takeda with written notice of termination of the co-development. In the event we elect to end the co-development, we will be subject to reduced payments and royalty rates as set forth more specifically in the License Agreement.\nPursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, Takeda has the sole discretion to assume or to designate a third party to assume our manufacturing activities under this agreement. Takeda may conduct these activities more slowly or in a different manner than we would. Takeda is also responsible for filing future applications with the FDA or other regulatory authorities for approval of the CD38 SLT-A fusion proteins. We cannot control whether Takeda will devote sufficient attention and resources to the development of the SLT-A fusion proteins or will proceed in an expeditious manner. Even if the FDA or other regulatory agencies approve any of the SLT-A fusion proteins, Takeda may elect not to proceed with the commercialization of the resulting product in one or more countries.\nUnder the terms of the License Agreement, we will receive payments and royalties upon reaching certain defined milestones. We may not reach any of the milestones that trigger a payment or royalties under the License Agreement and we are subject to reduced payments and royalty rates if we elect to end our co-development. We are also subject to royalty reductions if there exists a biosimilar product or generic product being sold by a third party. Following the exercise of our option to co-develop the licensed products, we have become responsible for sharing co-development costs with Takeda. We cannot predict these costs and it is possible that if we cannot afford these costs in the future, we may have to terminate the License Agreement and could be subject to lower milestone and royalty payments, which could harm our business.\nTakeda may elect to terminate the License Agreement for convenience upon 90 days prior written notice. Takeda also maintains the right to terminate the License Agreement in connection with our material breach and our insolvency. Takeda reserves certain rights, such as to undertake any not yet completed early stage program activities to be conducted by us, solely and exclusively, upon any change in control of us. If Takeda terminates the License Agreement, it will result in a delay in or could prevent us from further developing or commercializing the CD38 SLT-A fusion proteins, and will delay and could prevent us from obtaining revenues for this drug candidate.\nDisputes may arise between us and Takeda, which may delay or cause the termination of any CD38 SLT-A fusion protein clinical trials, result in significant litigation or cause Takeda to act in a manner that is not in our best interest. If development of the CD38 SLT-A fusion proteins does not progress for these or any other reasons, we would not receive further milestone payments or royalties on product sales from Takeda with respect to the CD38 SLT-A fusion proteins and may owe Takeda certain development milestones and royalties as well as amounts owed by Takeda pursuant to any of its third-party license agreements.\nIf Takeda terminates the License Agreement prior to regulatory approval of any drug candidates under this License Agreement, we may have to seek a new partner for development or commercialization or undertake and fund the development of the CD38 SLT-A fusion proteins or commercialization of the resulting drug ourselves. If we seek a new partner but are unable to do so on acceptable terms, or at all, or do not have sufficient funds to conduct the development or commercialization of the CD38 SLT-A fusion proteins ourselves, we may have to curtail or abandon that development or commercialization, which could harm our business.\nWe have entered into a Master Collaboration Agreement (\u201c Vertex Collaboration Agreement\u201d) with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (\u201cVertex\u201d) and, pursuant to the terms of that agreement, could become dependent on Vertex for development, manufacturing, regulatory and commercialization activities with respect to certain of our ETB products for novel targeted biologic therapies.\nIn November 2019, we entered into the Vertex Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to which we agreed to leverage our ETB technology platform to discover and develop novel targeted biologic therapies for applications outside of oncology. Pursuant to the terms of the Vertex Collaboration Agreement, we granted Vertex an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive license to exploit one or more ETB drug candidates that are discovered by us against up to two designated targets. Vertex has selected an initial target and has the option to designate one additional target within specified time limits.\nUnder the Vertex Collaboration Agreement, Vertex paid us an upfront payment of $38 million, consisting of $23 million in cash and a $15 million equity investment pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement. In addition to the upfront payments, we may also receive an additional $22 million through the exercise of the options to license ETB drug candidates or to add an additional target. We are required to provide, and Vertex will reimburse us for, certain mutually agreed manufacturing technology transfer activities. Vertex may never choose to exercise its option and we cannot predict whether Vertex will, if ever, exercise its option.\nWe may, for each target under the Vertex Collaboration Agreement, receive up to an additional $180 million in milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestone events and up to an additional $70 million in milestone payments upon the achievement of certain sales milestone events. We will also be entitled to receive, subject to certain reductions, tiered mid-single digit royalties as percentages of calendar year net sales, if any, on any licensed ETB product. The milestones that trigger a payment or royalties under the Vertex Collaboration Agreement may never be reached and failure to do so could harm our business and financial condition.\nWe will be responsible for conducting the research activities through the designation, if any, of one or more development candidates. Upon the exercise by Vertex of its option for a development candidate, Vertex will be responsible for all development, manufacturing, regulatory and commercialization activities with respect to that development candidate. We cannot control whether Vertex will devote sufficient attention and resources to this collaboration or will proceed in an expeditious manner. Even if the FDA or other regulatory agencies approve any of the licensed ETB drug candidates, Vertex may elect not to proceed with the commercialization of the resulting product in one or more countries.\nUnless earlier terminated, the Vertex Collaboration Agreement will expire (i) on a country-by-country basis and licensed product-by-licensed product basis on the date of expiration of all payment obligations under the Vertex Collaboration Agreement with respect to such licensed product in such country and (ii) in its entirety upon the expiration of all payment obligations thereunder with respect to all licensed products in all countries or upon Vertex\u2019s decision not to exercise any option on or prior to the applicable deadlines. Vertex has the right to terminate the Vertex Collaboration Agreement for convenience upon prior written notice to Company. Either party has the right to terminate the Vertex Collaboration Agreement (a) for the insolvency of the other party or (b) subject to specified cure periods, in the event of the other party\u2019s uncured material breach. If Vertex terminates the Vertex Collaboration Agreement, it will result in a delay in or could prevent us from further developing or commercializing products directed to these targets, and will delay and could prevent us from obtaining revenues for such product. Further, disputes may arise between us and Vertex, which may delay or cause the termination of this collaboration, result in significant litigation, cause Vertex to act in a manner that is not in our best interest, or cause us to seek another collaborator or proceed with development, commercialization and funding on our own. If we seek a new collaborator but are unable to do so on acceptable terms, or at all, or do not have sufficient funds to conduct the development or commercialization of product directed to these new targets ourselves, we may have to curtail or abandon that development or commercialization, which could harm our business.\nWe depend on third parties and intend to continue to license or collaborate with third parties and may be unable to realize the potential benefits of any collaboration.\nOur business strategy, along with our short- and long-term operating results depend in part on our ability to execute on existing strategic collaborations and to license or partner with new strategic partners. In addition to the License Agreement and the Collaboration Agreement, we have multi-target research and development collaborations ongoing with Takeda and expect to seek to collaborate with other partners in the future. Even if we are successful in entering into one or more additional collaborations with respect to the development and/or commercialization of one or more drug candidates, there is no guarantee that any of these collaborations will be successful. We believe collaborations allow us to leverage our resources and technologies and we anticipate deriving some revenues from research and development fees, license fees, milestone payments, and royalties from our collaborative partner. Collaborations may pose a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\ncollaboration partners often have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to the collaboration, and may not commit sufficient resources to the development, marketing or commercialization of the product or products that are subject to the collaboration;\n\u2022\ncollaboration partners may not perform their obligations as expected or may breach or terminate their agreements with us or otherwise fail to conduct their collaborative activities successfully and in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nany such collaboration may significantly limit our share of potential future profits from the associated program, and may require us to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our current drug candidates, potential products or proprietary technologies or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us;\n\u2022\ncollaboration partners may cease to devote resources to the development or commercialization of our drug candidates if the collaboration partners view our drug candidates as competitive with their own products or drug candidates;\n\u2022\ndisagreements with collaboration partners, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the course of development, might cause delays or termination of the development or commercialization of drug candidates, and might result in legal proceedings, which would be time consuming, distracting and expensive;\n\u2022\ncollaboration partners may be impacted by changes in their strategic focus or available funding, or business combinations involving them, which could cause them to divert resources away from the collaboration;\n\u2022\ncollaboration partners may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n\u2022\nthe collaborations may not result in us achieving revenues sufficient to justify such transactions;\n\u2022\nby entering into certain collaborations, we may forego opportunities to collaborate with other third parties who do not wish to be associated with our existing third-party strategic partners; and\n\u2022\ncollaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for us to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable drug candidate.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in establishing collaborative arrangements on acceptable terms or at all, that collaborative partners will not terminate funding before the completion of projects, that our collaborative arrangements will result in successful product commercialization, or that we will derive any revenues from such arrangements. Potential collaborators may reject collaborations based upon their assessment of our financial, regulatory or intellectual property position and our internal capabilities. Additionally, the negotiation, documentation and implementation of collaborative arrangements are complex and time-consuming. Our discussions with potential collaborators may not lead to new collaborations on favorable terms and may have the potential to provide collaborators with access to our key intellectual property rights.\nWe enter into various contracts in the normal course of our business in which we indemnify the other party to the contract. In the event we have to perform under these indemnification provisions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the normal course of business, we have and expect to continue periodically to enter into academic, commercial, service, collaboration, licensing, consulting and other agreements that contain indemnification provisions. With respect to our academic and other research agreements, we typically indemnify the institution and related parties from losses arising from claims relating to our drug candidates, processes or services made, used, or performed pursuant to the agreements, and from claims arising from our or our sublicensees\u2019 exercise of rights under the agreement. With respect to our collaboration agreements, we indemnify our collaboration partners from any third-party product liability claims that could result from the production or use of the drug candidate, as well as for alleged infringements of any patent or other intellectual property right owned by a third party. With respect to consultants, we often indemnify them from claims arising from the good faith performance of their services.\nIf our obligations under an indemnification provision exceed applicable insurance coverage or if we were denied insurance coverage, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Similarly, if we are relying on a collaborator to indemnify us and the collaborator is denied insurance coverage or the indemnification obligation exceeds the applicable insurance coverage, and if the collaborator does not have other assets available to indemnify us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of Our Drug Candidates\nWe currently have limited marketing and sales experience. If we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our drug candidates, we may be unable to generate any revenue.\nAlthough some of our employees may have marketed, launched and sold other pharmaceutical products in the past while employed at other companies, we have no experience selling and marketing our drug candidates, and we currently have no marketing or sales organization. To successfully commercialize any products that may result from our development programs, we will need to find one or more collaboration partners to commercialize our products or invest in and develop these capabilities, either on our own or with others, which would be expensive, difficult and time consuming. Any failure or delay in the timely development of our internal commercialization capabilities could adversely impact the potential for success of our products.\nIf commercialization collaboration partners do not commit sufficient resources to commercialize our future drugs and we are unable to develop the necessary marketing and sales capabilities on our own, we will be unable to generate sufficient product revenue to sustain or grow our business. We may be competing with companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations, particularly in the markets our drug candidates are intended to address. Without appropriate capabilities, whether directly or through third-party collaboration partners, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.\nWe may attempt to form additional collaborations in the future with respect to our drug candidates, but we may not be able to do so, which may cause us to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nWe may attempt to form strategic collaborations, create joint ventures or enter into licensing arrangements with third parties with respect to our programs in addition to those that we currently have that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. We may face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic collaboration partners, and the negotiation process to secure appropriate terms is time consuming and complex. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish such a strategic collaboration for any drug candidates and programs on terms that are acceptable, or at all. This may be because our drug candidates and programs may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort, our research and development pipeline may be viewed as insufficient, the competitive or intellectual property landscape may be viewed as too intense or risky, and/or third parties may not view our drug candidates and programs as having sufficient potential for commercialization, including the likelihood of an adequate safety and efficacy profile.\nAny delays in identifying suitable collaboration partners and entering into agreements to develop and/or commercialize our drug candidates could delay the development or commercialization of our drug candidates, which may reduce their competitiveness even if they reach the market. Absent a strategic collaborator, we would need to undertake development and/or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund and undertake development and/or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may not be able to develop our drug candidates or bring them to market and our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf the market opportunities for our drug candidates are smaller than we believe they are, we may not meet our revenue expectations and, even if a drug candidate receives marketing approval, our business may suffer. Because the patient populations in the market for our drug candidates may be small, we must be able to successfully identify patients and acquire a significant market share to achieve profitability and growth.\nOur estimates for the addressable patient population and our estimates for the prices we can charge for our drug candidates may differ significantly from the actual market addressable by our drug candidates. For instance, our Phase II combination study of MT-3724 with GEMOX is focused on non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. The estimated incidence of non-Hodgkin\u2019s B-cell lymphoma is 74,200 new cases and approximately 19,970 deaths were attributable to the disease in the United States in 2019, only a subset of which may benefit from treatment with MT-3724. Our projections of both the number of people who have these diseases, as well as the subset of people with these diseases who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our drug candidates, are based on our beliefs and estimates. These estimates have been derived from a variety of sources, including the scientific literature, patient foundations or market research, and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases. The number of patients may turn out to be lower than expected. Additionally, while we believe that the data in our Phase II clinical trials for MT-3724 will be supportive of application to other indications, there can be no assurance that our clinical trials will successfully address any additional indications. Similarly, the potentially addressable patient population for each of our drug candidates may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with our drug candidates, and new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe face substantial competition and our competitors may discover, develop or commercialize drugs faster or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition from large pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, universities and other research institutions worldwide with respect to MT-3724 and the other drug candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future. We are aware that companies including the following have products marketed or in development that could compete directly or indirectly with ETBs: Genentech, Bayer, Takeda, AbbVie, Seattle Genetics, Immunogen, Morphosys, Genmab, Bristol Myers Squibb, Novartis, Regeneron, Janssen, Xencor, Amgen, Macrogenics, Astra Zeneca, Lilly, Merck KGaA, Pfizer, Merus, Sanofi, Mentrik Biotech, Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Unum Therapeutics, Daiichi Sankyo, Karyopharm, ADC Therapeutics, Bluebird Bio, Gilead, ZymeWorks, Forty Seven, GlaxoSmithKline, and F-Star. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing technologies and drug products that are more effective or less costly than MT-3724 or any other drug candidates that we are currently developing or that we may develop, which could render our drug candidates obsolete and noncompetitive.\nMany of our competitors have materially greater name recognition and financial, manufacturing, marketing, research and drug development resources than we do. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Large pharmaceutical companies in particular have extensive expertise in preclinical and clinical testing and in obtaining regulatory approvals for drugs, including biologics. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies. These organizations may also establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors.\nIf our competitors obtain marketing approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for their drug candidates more rapidly than we do, it could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Third-party payors, including governmental and private insurers, also may encourage the use of generic products. For example, if MT-3724 is ultimately approved, it may be priced at a significant premium over other competitive products. This may make it difficult for MT-3724 or any other future drugs to compete with these products. Failure of MT-3724 or other drug candidates to effectively compete against established treatment options or in the future with new products currently in development would harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe commercial success of any of our current or future drug candidates will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors, and others in the medical community.\nEven with the approvals from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, the commercial success of our drugs will depend in part on the health care providers, patients and third-party payors accepting our drug candidates as medically useful, cost-effective and safe. Any product that we bring to the market may not gain market acceptance by physicians, patients and third-party payors. The degree of market acceptance of any of our drugs will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy of the product as demonstrated in clinical trials and potential advantages over competing treatments;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of the disease and any side effects of the product;\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which approval is granted, including any limitations or warnings contained in a product\u2019s approved labeling;\n\u2022\nthe convenience and ease of administration of the product;\n\u2022\nthe cost of treatment;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of the patients and physicians to accept these therapies;\n\u2022\nthe perceived ratio of risk and benefit of these therapies by physicians and the willingness of physicians to recommend these therapies to patients based on such risks and benefits;\n\u2022\nthe marketing, sales and distribution support for the product;\n\u2022\nthe publicity concerning our drugs or competing products and treatments; and\n\u2022\nthe pricing and availability of third-party insurance coverage and reimbursement.\nEven if a product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile upon approval, market acceptance of the product remains uncertain. Efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of the drugs may require significant investment and resources and may never be successful. If our drugs fail to achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and other health care providers, we will not be able to generate sufficient revenue to become or remain profitable.\nWe may not be successful in any efforts to identify, license, discover, develop or commercialize additional drug candidates.\nAlthough a substantial amount of our effort will focus on the continued clinical testing, potential approval and commercialization of our existing drug candidates, the success of our business is also expected to depend in part upon our ability to identify, license, discover, develop or commercialize additional drug candidates. Research programs to identify new drug candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources. We may focus our efforts and resources on potential programs or drug candidates that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful. Our research programs or licensing efforts may fail to yield additional drug candidates for clinical development and commercialization for a number of reasons, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nour research or business development methodology or search criteria and process may be unsuccessful in identifying potential drug candidates;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able or willing to assemble sufficient resources to acquire or discover additional drug candidates;\n\u2022\nour drug candidates may not succeed in preclinical or clinical testing;\n\u2022\nour drug candidates may be shown to have harmful side effects or may have other characteristics that may make them unmarketable or unlikely to receive marketing approval;\n\u2022\ncompetitors may develop alternatives that render our drug candidates obsolete or less attractive;\n\u2022\ndrug candidates we develop may be covered by third parties\u2019 patents or other exclusive rights;\n\u2022\nthe market for a drug candidate may change during our program so that such a drug candidate may become unreasonable to continue to develop;\n\u2022\na drug candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all; and\n\u2022\na drug candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients, the medical community or third-party payors.\nIf any of these events occur, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for a program or programs, or we may not be able to identify, license, discover, develop or commercialize additional drug candidates, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and could potentially cause us to cease operations.\nFailure to obtain or maintain adequate reimbursement or insurance coverage for drugs, if any, could limit our ability to market those drugs and decrease our ability to generate revenue.\nThe pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of our approved drugs, if any, must be sufficient to support our commercial efforts and other development programs, and the availability and adequacy of coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors, including governmental and private insurers, are essential for most patients to be able to afford medical treatments. Sales of our approved drugs, if any, will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our approved drugs, if any, will be paid for or reimbursed by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or government payors and private payors. If coverage and reimbursement are not available, or are available only in limited amounts, we may have to subsidize or provide drugs for free or we may not be able to successfully commercialize our drugs.\nIn addition, there is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs. In the United States, the principal decisions about coverage and reimbursement for new drugs are typically made by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, as CMS decides whether and to what extent a new drug will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare. Private payors tend to follow the coverage reimbursement policies established by CMS to a substantial degree. It is difficult to predict what CMS will decide with respect to reimbursement for novel drug candidates such as ours and what reimbursement codes our drug candidates may receive if approved.\nOutside the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other price-restrictive regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe, Canada and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of drugs. In many countries, the prices of drugs are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. Price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our drugs, if any. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the potential revenue may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenue and profits.\nMoreover, increasing efforts by governmental and private payors in the United States and abroad to limit or reduce healthcare costs may result in restrictions on coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our drugs, if any. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with drugs due to the increasing trend toward managed healthcare, including the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, and prescription drugs in particular, has and is expected to continue to increase in the future. As a result, profitability of our drugs, if any, may be more difficult to achieve even if any of them receive regulatory approval.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock is expected to be volatile, and the market price of the common stock may drop.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations. Market prices for securities of early-stage pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain regulatory approvals for MT-3724 or other drug candidates, and delays or failures to obtain such approvals;\n\u2022\nfailure of any of our drug candidates, if approved, to achieve commercial success;\n\u2022\nfailure to maintain our existing third-party license and supply agreements;\n\u2022\nfailure by us or our licensors to prosecute, maintain, or enforce our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our drug candidates;\n\u2022\nany inability to obtain adequate supply of our drug candidates or the inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022\nadverse regulatory authority decisions;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new products, services or technologies by our competitors;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet or exceed financial and development projections we may provide to the public;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet or exceed the financial and development projections of the investment community;\n\u2022\nthe perception of the pharmaceutical industry by the public, legislatures, regulators and the investment community;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant acquisitions, strategic collaborations, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nsignificant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u2022\nfailure by securities or industry analysts to publish research or reports about our business, or issuance of any adverse or misleading opinions by such analysts regarding our business or stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\ngeneral market or macroeconomic conditions;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future;\n\u2022\nthe trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\nthe issuance of additional shares of our preferred stock or common stock, or the perception that such issuances may occur, including through our \u201cat-the-market\u201d offering program or any sales of our preferred stock or common stock by our stockholders in the future;\n\u2022\nannouncements by commercial partners or competitors of new commercial products, clinical progress or the lack thereof, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity relating to ETB drugs generally, including with respect to other drugs and potential drugs in such markets;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of technological innovations or new therapies that compete with our potential drugs;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of health care payment systems; and\n\u2022\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.\nMoreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nAdditionally, a decrease in our stock price may cause our common stock to no longer satisfy the continued listing standards of The Nasdaq Capital Market. If we are not able to maintain the requirements for listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, we could be delisted, which could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to raise additional funds as well as the price and liquidity of our common stock.\nFuture sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could cause our stock price to fall.\nIf our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. As of December 31, 2019, a total of 45,589,157 shares of our common stock were outstanding. Any sales of those shares or any perception in the market that such sales may occur could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nIn addition, shares of our common stock that are either subject to outstanding options or reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plan will be eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting schedules. If these additional shares of common stock are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock, securities convertible into common stock, or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, the Sales Agreement with Cantor, or otherwise, could result in dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nEven after giving effect to the funds raised in the past, we expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To raise capital we may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner in which we may determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors in a prior transaction may be materially diluted. Additionally, new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock. Further, any future sales of our common stock by us or resales of our common stock by our existing stockholders could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nPursuant to our 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2018 Plan, we are authorized and have available to grant equity awards to our employees, directors and consultants shares of our common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to the 2018 Plan which includes potential forfeitures and cancellations of outstanding stock options from the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2009 Equity Incentive Plan, and 2014 Equity Incentive Plan. Any future grants of options, warrants or other securities exercisable or convertible into our common stock, or the exercise or conversion of such shares, and any sales of such shares in the market, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nPursuant to the Sales Agreement with Cantor, we may offer and sell up to $50,000,000 of our common stock from time to time through Cantor as our sales agent. Sales of the shares of our common stock, if any, may be made by any means permitted by law and deemed to be an \u201cat-the-market\u201d offering as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act and will generally be made by means of brokers' transactions on the NASDAQ Global Market or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, or as otherwise agreed with Cantor. To date, we have not sold any shares of our common stock under the Sales Agreement. Whether we choose to effect future sales under the Sales Agreement will depend upon a variety of factors, including, among others, market conditions and the trading price of our common stock relative to other sources of capital. The issuance from time to time of these new shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement or in any other equity offering, or the perception that such sales may occur, could have the effect of depressing the market price of our common stock.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of our cash reserves and may not use these reserves effectively or as anticipated by stockholders.\nWe have broad discretion over the use of our cash reserves, including the proceeds from our previous financings, including from the sale of shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement and from our public offering in November 2019. Our stockholders may not agree with our decisions, and our use of these funds may not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our common stock. Our failure to apply these funds effectively could compromise our ability to pursue our growth strategy, result in financial losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, cause the price of our common stock to decline and delay the development of our drug candidates. Pending their use, we may invest our cash reserves in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value. It is possible that the proceeds will be invested in a way that does not yield a favorable, or any, return for us. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or the trading price of our common stock.\nWe may incur significant costs from class action litigation due to our expected stock volatility.\nOur stock price may fluctuate for many reasons, including as a result of public announcements regarding the progress of our development efforts or the development efforts of future collaboration partners or competitors, the addition or departure of our key personnel, variations in our quarterly operating results and changes in market valuations of biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.\nThis risk is especially relevant to us because biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. When the market price of a stock has been volatile, as our stock price may be, holders of that stock have occasionally brought securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders were to bring a lawsuit of this type against us, even if the lawsuit is without merit, it could result in substantial costs for defending the lawsuit and diversion of the time, attention and resources of our board of directors and management, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions of Delaware law, where we are incorporated, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nauthorizing our board of directors to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without any need for approval by stockholders;\n\u2022\nproviding for a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nrequiring supermajority stockholder votes to effect certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws;\n\u2022\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nWe can issue and have issued shares of preferred stock, which may adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock with designations, rights, and preferences determined from time-to-time by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, our Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights superior to those of holders of our common stock. For example, an issuance of shares of preferred stock could:\n\u2022\nadversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for a third party to gain control of us;\n\u2022\ndiscourage bids for our common stock at a premium;\n\u2022\nlimit or eliminate any payments that the holders of our common stock could expect to receive upon our liquidation; or\n\u2022\notherwise adversely affect the market price or our common stock.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.\nIn addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, our amended and restated bylaws and our indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our directors and executive officers provide that:\n\u2022\nWe will indemnify our directors and executive officers for serving us in those capacities or for serving other related business enterprises at our request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the registrant and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person\u2019s conduct was unlawful.\n\u2022\nWe may, in our discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law.\n\u2022\nWe are required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or officers shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.\n\u2022\nThe rights conferred in our amended and restated bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons.\n\u2022\nWe may not retroactively amend our amended and restated bylaw provisions to reduce our indemnification obligations to directors, officers, employees and agents.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be our stockholders\u2019 sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nWe incur, and will continue to incur, costs and expect significantly increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is now required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, and particularly after we cease to be a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d, and/or an accelerated filer, we are incurring and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company or as a public company prior to the loss of such specified statuses. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, as well as various requirements imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, rules subsequently adopted by the SEC and Nasdaq to implement provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. The listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market require that we satisfy certain corporate governance requirements relating to director independence, distributing annual and interim reports, stockholder meetings, approvals and voting, soliciting proxies, conflicts of interest and a code of conduct, each of which requires additional attention and effort of management and our board of directors and additional costs.\nWe expect the rules and regulations applicable to public companies to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. We also expect that we will need to hire additional accounting, finance and other personnel in connection with our efforts to comply with the requirements of being a public company, and our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time towards maintaining compliance with these requirements. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors and committees thereof or as executive officers.\nOur executive officers, directors and principal stockholders have the ability to significantly influence all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our directors, executive officers, and stockholders beneficially owning 5% or more of our shares or that may be affiliated with our board members, beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 50% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they would be able to significantly influence almost all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, these persons, if they choose to act together, would significantly influence the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provisions of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish, or cease publishing, research or reports, or publish unfavorable research or reports, about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced, in part, by the research and reports that industry or financial research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If only a few securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the trading price for our stock would likely be negatively affected and there can be no assurance that analysts will provide favorable coverage. If securities or industry analysts who initiate coverage downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or our market, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and any trading volume to decline.\nHaving availed ourselves of scaled disclosure available to smaller reporting companies, we cannot be certain if such reduced disclosure will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nUnder Section 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, a \"smaller reporting company\" is a company that is not an investment company, an asset backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company. Effective September 10, 2018, the definition of a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d was amended to include companies with a public float of less than $250 million as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter or, if such public float is less than $700 million, had annual revenues of less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. Smaller reporting companies are permitted to provide simplified executive compensation disclosure in their filings; they are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting; and they have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports. At June 30, 2019, we qualified as a smaller reporting company. For as long as we continue to be a smaller reporting company, we expect that we will take advantage of the reduced disclosure obligations available to us as a result of those respective classifications. Decreased disclosure in our SEC filings as a result of our having availed ourselves of scaled disclosure may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to retain our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Scientific Officer and to attract, retain, and motivate other qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on Eric E. Poma, Ph.D., our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Scientific Officer, the loss of whose services may adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. Dr. Poma could leave our employment at any time, as he is an \u201cat will\u201d employee. Recruiting and retaining other qualified employees, consultants and advisors for our business, including scientific and technical personnel, will also be crucial to our success. There is currently a shortage of highly qualified personnel in our industry, which is likely to continue. Additionally, this shortage of highly qualified personnel is particularly acute in the area where we are located. As a result, competition for personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for individuals with similar skill sets. In addition, failure to succeed in development and commercialization of our drug candidates may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel. The inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel, or the loss of the services of Dr. Poma may impede the progress of our research, development and commercialization objectives and would negatively impact our ability to succeed in our product development strategy.\nWe will need to continue to expand our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had 151 full-time employees and 17 part-time and temporary employees. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, we expect to need additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial, legal and other resources. Our management may need to divert its attention away from its day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of additional drug candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected or budgeted, our ability to generate and/or grow revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our currently anticipated business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize drug candidates and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth. Failure to manage this growth could disrupt our business operations and negatively impact our ability to achieve success.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology or loss of data, including any cyber security incidents, could compromise sensitive information related to our business, prevent us from accessing critical information or expose us to liability which could harm our ability to operate our business effectively and adversely affect our business and reputation.\nOur ability to execute our business plan and maintain operations depends on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology, or IT, systems. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including personally identifiable information about our employees, intellectual property, and proprietary business information. We manage and maintain our applications and data utilizing on-site systems and we also have outsourced elements of our operations to third parties, and as a result we manage a number of third-party vendors who may or could have access to our confidential information. These applications and data encompass a wide variety of business-critical information including research and development information and business and financial information.\nThe secure processing, storage, maintenance and transmission of this critical information is vital to our operations and business strategy. Despite the implementation of security measures, our IT systems are vulnerable to risks and damages from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, breaches, unauthorized access, interruptions due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions, or damage from natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Moreover, despite network security and back-up measures, some of our and our vendors\u2019 servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, including cyber-attacks, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. These events could lead to the unauthorized access, disclosure and use of non-public information including our intellectual property or proprietary business information.\nThe techniques used by criminal elements to attack computer systems are sophisticated, change frequently and may originate from less regulated or remote areas of the world. As a result, we may not be able to address these techniques proactively or implement adequate preventative measures. There can be no assurance that we will promptly detect any such disruption or security breach, if at all. If our computer systems are compromised, we could be subject to fines, damages, reputational harm, litigation and enforcement actions, and we could lose trade secrets, the occurrence of which could harm our business, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. For example, any such event that leads to unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information, including personal information regarding our patients or employees, could harm our reputation, require us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information. In addition, the loss of data from clinical trials for our drug candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce data and a cybersecurity breach could adversely affect our reputation and could result in other negative consequences, including disruption of our internal operations, increased cyber security protection costs, lost revenues or litigation. Despite precautionary measures to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our IT systems, sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to generate and maintain data could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.", "PERMNO": 90604, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "MTEM"}
