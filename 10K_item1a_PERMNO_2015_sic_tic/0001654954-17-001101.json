{"cik": "1596961", "company": "RumbleON, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and related notes and \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" before deciding to invest in our common stock. If any of the events or developments described below occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially or adversely affected. As a result, the market price of our common stock could decline, and investors could lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have no operating history and we cannot assure you the Company will achieve or maintain profitability.\nOur business model is unproven and we have no operating history. We are only in the initial development stage of our business. We expect to make significant investments in the further development and expansion of our business and these investments may not result in the successful development, operation, or growth of our business on a timely basis or at all. We may not generate sufficient revenue and we may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including a lack of demand for our products and services, increasing competition, weakness in the motorcycle, power sport, and other recreational vehicle industries generally, as well as other risks described in these Risk Factors, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays, and other unknown factors relating to the development and operation of our business. Accordingly, we may not be able to successfully develop and operate our business, generate revenue, or achieve or maintain profitability.\nThe initial development and growth of our business over the first 24 months of operations, and such growth may not be indicative of our future growth and, if we continue to grow rapidly, we may not be able to manage our growth effectively.\nWe expect that, in the future, as our revenue increases, our rate of growth will decline. In addition, we will not be able to grow as fast or at all if we do not accomplish the following:\n\u25cf\nmaintain and grow our dealer relationships and network;\n\u25cf\nincrease the number of users of our products and services, and in particular the number of unique visitors to our website and our branded mobile applications;\n\u25cf\nfurther improve the quality of our existing products and services, and introduce high quality new products and services;\n\u25cf\nincrease the number of transactions between our users and both RumbleON and our dealer networks; and\n\u25cf\nintroduce third party ancillary products and services.\nWe may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. We plan to continue our investment in future growth. We expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on:\n\u25cf\nmarketing and advertising;\n\u25cf\nproduct and service development; including investments in our website, business processes, infrastructure, product and service development team and the development of new products and services and new features for existing products; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral administration, including legal, accounting and other compliance expenses related to being a public company.\nIn addition, our anticipated growth may place and may continue to place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial resources. As we grow, we expect to hire additional personnel. Also, our organizational structure will become more complex as we add additional staff, and we will need to ensure we adequately develop and maintain operational, financial and management controls as well as our reporting systems and procedures.\nOur auditor\u2019s report reflects the fact that the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital from the sale of common stock and, ultimately the achievement of significant operating revenue. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, you will lose your investment.\nOur financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our auditor\u2019s report reflects that the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital from the sale of common stock or through other debt or equity financings and, ultimately, the achievement of significant operating revenue. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, stockholders will lose their investment. We will be required to seek additional capital to fund future growth and expansion. No assurance can be given that such financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on commercially favorable terms acceptable to us. Moreover, favorable financing may be dilutive to investors.\nWe may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances. If capital is not available on terms acceptable to us or at all, we may not be able to develop and grow our business as anticipated and our business, operating results and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support the development and growth of our business and, we may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. However, additional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Volatility in the credit markets may also have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt financing. Also, the incurrence of leverage, the debt service requirements resulting therefrom, and the possibility of a need for financing or any additional financing could have important and negative consequences, including the following: (a) the Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate or other purposes may be impaired in the future; (b) certain future borrowings may be at variable rates of interest, which will expose the Company to the risk of increased interest rates; (c) the Company may need to use a portion of the money it earns to pay principal and interest on their credit facilities, which will reduce the amount of money available to finance operations and other business activities, repay other indebtedness, and pay distributions; and (d) substantial leverage may limit the Company\u2019s flexibility to adjust to changing economic or market conditions, reduce their ability to withstand competitive pressures and make them more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions.\nIf we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to pursue our business objectives and to respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly limited, and our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.\nIf key industry participants, including recreation vehicle dealers and recreation vehicle manufacturers, perceive us in a negative light or our relationships with them suffer harm, our ability to operate and grow our business and our financial performance may be damaged.\nWe anticipate that we will derive a significant portion of or revenue from fees paid by existing recreation vehicle dealers for dealer services we may provide them. In addition, we intend to utilize a select set of dealers to perform services for our benefit, including, among other things, vehicle reconditioning, vehicle storage and vehicle photography. If our relationships with our network of dealers suffer harm in a manner that leads to the departure of these dealers from our network, then our ability to operate our business, grow revenue, and lower our costs will be adversely affected.\nWe cannot assure you that we will maintain strong relationships with the dealers in our network or that we will not suffer dealer attrition in the future. We may also have disputes with dealers from time to time, including relating to the collection of fees from them and other matters. We may need to modify our products, change pricing or take other actions to address dealer concerns in the future. If we are unable to create and maintain a compelling value proposition for dealers to become and remain dealers, our dealer network will not grow and may begin to decline. If a significant number of these dealers decided to leave our network or change their financial or business relationship with us, then our business, growth, operating results, financial condition and prospects would suffer. Additionally, if we are unable to add dealers to our network, our growth could be impaired.\nWe may be unable to maintain or grow relationships with information data providers or may experience interruptions in the data feeds they provide, which may limit the information that we are able to provide to our users and dealers as well as adversely affect the timeliness of such information and may impair our ability to attract or retain consumers and our dealers and to timely invoice all parties.\nWe expect to receive data from third-party data providers, including our network of dealers, dealer management system data feed providers, data aggregators and integrators, survey companies, purveyors of registration data and possibly others. There may be some instances in which we use this information to collect a transaction fee from those dealers and recognize revenue from the related transactions.\nFrom time to time, we may experience interruptions in one or more data feeds that we receive from third-party data providers, particularly dealer management system data feed providers, in a manner that affects our ability to timely invoice the dealers in our network. These interruptions may occur for a number of reasons, including changes to the software used by these data feed providers and difficulties in renewing our agreements with third-party data feed providers. Additionally, when an interruption ceases, we may not always be able to collect the appropriate fees and any such shortfall in revenue could be material to our operating results.\nIf we suffer a significant interruption in our ability to gain access to third-party data, our business and operating results will suffer.\nOur business also relies on our ability to analyze significant amounts of data in a timely manner. The effectiveness of our user acquisition efforts depends in part on the availability of data relating to existing and potential users of our platform. If we experience a material disruption in the data provided to us or if third-party data providers terminate their relationship with us, the quality of this information may suffer, and our business, results of operations and financial conditions could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe success of our business relies heavily on our marketing and branding efforts, especially with respect to the RumbleON website and our branded mobile applications, and these efforts may not be successful.\nWe believe that an important component of our development and growth will be the business derived from the RumbleON website and our branded mobile applications. Because RumbleON is a consumer brand, we rely heavily on marketing and advertising to increase the visibility of this brand with potential users of our products and services.\nOur business model relies on our ability to scale rapidly and to decrease incremental user acquisition costs as we grow. Some of our methods of marketing and advertising may not be profitable because they may not result in the acquisition of a sufficient users visiting our website and mobile applications such that we may recover these costs by attaining corresponding revenue growth. If we are unable to recover our marketing and advertising costs through increases in user traffic and in the number of transactions by users of our platform, it could have a material adverse effect on our growth, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe failure to develop and maintain our brand could harm our ability to grow unique visitor traffic and to expand our dealer network.\nDeveloping and maintaining the RumbleON brand will depend largely on the success of our efforts to maintain the trust of our users and dealers and to deliver value to each of our users and dealers. If our potential users perceive that we are not focused primarily on providing them with a better recreation vehicle buying experience, our reputation and the strength of our brand will be adversely affected.\nComplaints or negative publicity about our business practices, our marketing and advertising campaigns, our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the integrity of the data that we provide to users, data privacy and security issues, and other aspects of our business, irrespective of their validity, could diminish users' and dealers' confidence in and the use of our products and services and adversely affect our brand. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop, maintain or enhance our brand, and failure to do so would harm our business growth prospects and operating results.\nWe will rely on Internet search engines to drive traffic to our website, and if we fail to appear prominently in the search results, our traffic would decline and our business would be adversely affected.\nWe will depend in part on Internet search engines such as Google\u2122, Bing\u2122, and Yahoo!\u2122 to drive traffic to our website. For example, when a user searches the internet for a particular type of recreational vehicle, we will rely on a high organic search ranking of our webpages in these search results to refer the user to our website. However, our ability to maintain high, non-paid search result rankings is not within our control. Our competitors' Internet search engine optimization efforts may result in their websites receiving a higher search result page ranking than ours, or Internet search engines could revise their methodologies in a way that would adversely affect our search result rankings. If Internet search engines modify their search algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us, or if our competitors' efforts are more successful than ours, overall growth in our user base could slow or our user base could decline. Internet search engine providers could provide recreation vehicle dealer and pricing information directly in search results, align with our competitors or choose to develop competing services. Any reduction in the number of users directed to our website through Internet search engines could harm our business and operating results.\nA significant disruption in service on our website or of our mobile applications could damage our reputation and result in a loss of consumers, which could harm our business, brand, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur brand, reputation and ability to attract consumers, affinity groups and advertisers depend on the reliable performance of our technology infrastructure and content delivery. We may experience significant interruptions with our systems in the future. Interruptions in these systems, whether due to system failures, computer viruses, or physical or electronic break-ins, could affect the security or availability of our products on our website and mobile application, and prevent or inhibit the ability of consumers to access our products. Problems with the reliability or security of our systems could harm our reputation, result in a loss of consumers, dealers and affinity group marketing partners, and result in additional costs.\nWe intend to locate our communications, network, and computer hardware used to operate our website and mobile applications at facilities in various parts of the country to minimize the risk and create an environment where we can remain online if one of the facilities in which our equipment is housed goes offline. Nevertheless, we will not own or control the operation of these facilities, and our systems and operations will be vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, acts of war, electronic and physical break-ins, computer viruses, earthquakes, and similar events. The occurrence of any of these events could result in damage to our systems and hardware or could cause them to fail.\nProblems faced by any third-party web hosting providers we may utilize could adversely affect the experience of our consumers. Any third-party web hosting providers could close their facilities without adequate notice. Any financial difficulties, up to and including bankruptcy, faced by any third-party web hosting providers or any of the service providers with whom they contract may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict. If our third-party web hosting providers are unable to keep up with our growing capacity needs, our business could be harmed.\nAny errors, defects, disruptions, or other performance or reliability problems with our network operations could cause interruptions in access to our products as well as delays and additional expense in arranging new facilities and services and could harm our reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to provide a compelling recreation vehicle buying experience to our users, the number of transactions between our users, RumbleON and dealers will decline and our revenue and results of operations will suffer harm.\nWe cannot assure you that we are able to provide a compelling recreation vehicle buying experience to our users, and our failure to do so will mean that the number of transactions between our users, RumbleON and dealers will decline and we will be unable to effectively monetize our user traffic. We believe that our ability to provide a compelling recreation vehicle buying experience is subject to a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nour ability to launch new products that are effective and have a high degree of consumer engagement; and\n\u25cf\ncompliance of the dealers within our dealer network with applicable laws, regulations and the rules of our platform.\nThe growth of our business relies significantly on our ability to increase the number of dealers in our network such that we are able to increase the number of transactions between our users and dealers. Failure to do so would limit our growth.\nOur ability to grow the number of dealers in our network is an important factor in growing our business. We are a new participant in the recreational vehicle industry, our business may be viewed in a negative light by recreation vehicle dealerships, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or grow the number of recreation vehicle dealers in our network.\nOur ability to grow our complementary product offerings may be limited, which could negatively impact our development, growth, revenue and financial performance.\nAs we introduce or expand additional offerings for our platform, such as recreation vehicle trade-ins, lead management, transaction processing, financing, leasing, maintenance and insurance, we may incur losses or otherwise fail to enter these markets successfully. Our expansion into these markets may place us in competitive and regulatory environments with which we are unfamiliar and involves various risks, including the need to invest significant resources and the possibility that returns on such investments will not be achieved for several years, if at all. In attempting to establish such new product offerings, we may incur significant expenses and face various other challenges, such as expanding our sales force and management personnel to cover these markets and complying with complicated regulations that apply to these markets. In addition, we may not successfully demonstrate the value of these ancillary products to consumers or dealers, and failure to do so would compromise our ability to successfully expand into these additional revenue streams.\nWe will be relying on third-party financing providers to finance a significant portion of our customers\u2019 vehicle purchases.\nWe will be relying on third-party financing providers to finance a significant portion of our customers\u2019 vehicle purchases. Accordingly, our revenue and results of operations are partially dependent on the actions of these third parties. We will provide financing to qualified customers through a number of third-party financing providers. If one or more of these third-party providers cease to provide financing to our customers, provide financing to fewer customers or no longer provide financing on competitive terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations. Additionally, if we were unable to replace the current third-party providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events, it could also have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations. We will rely on third-party providers to supply Extended Protection Plan (\"EPP\") products to our customers. Accordingly, our revenue and results of operations will be partially dependent on the actions of these third-parties. If one or more of these third-party providers cease to provide EPP products, make changes to their products or no longer provide their products on competitive terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue and results of operations. Additionally, if we were unable to replace the current third-party providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events, it could also have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue and results of operations.\nRetail sales of recreational vehicles by the Company may be adversely impacted by increased supply of and/or declining prices for used recreational vehicles and excess supply of new recreational vehicles.\nRetail sales of recreational vehicles by the Company may be adversely impacted by increased supply of and/or declining prices for used recreational vehicles and excess supply of new recreational vehicles. The Company believes that when prices for used recreational vehicles have declined, it can have the effect of reducing demand among retail purchasers for new recreational vehicles (at or near manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail prices). Further, the manufacturers of recreational vehicles can and do take actions that influence the markets for new and used recreational vehicles. For example, introduction of new models with significantly different functionality, technology or other customer satisfiers can result in increased supply of used recreational vehicles, and a decrease in the inventory of used recreational vehicles available for sale at dealers in the U.S. could result in an increased supply or decreased demand in the market for used recreational vehicles, which could result in declining prices for used recreational vehicles, and prior model-year new recreational vehicles. Also, while historically manufacturers have taken steps designed to balance production volumes for its new recreational vehicles with demand, those steps may not be effective, or further manufacturers could choose to supply new recreational vehicles to the market in excess of demand at reduced prices which could also have the effect of reducing demand for used recreational vehicles. Ultimately, reduced demand among retail purchasers for new recreational vehicles leads to reduced shipments by the Company.\nWe rely on a number of third parties to perform certain operating and administrative functions for the Company.\nWe rely on a number of third parties to perform certain operating and administrative functions for us. We may experience problems with outsourced services, such as unfavorable pricing, untimely delivery of services, or poor quality. Also, these suppliers may experience adverse economic conditions due to difficulties in the global economy that could lead to difficulties supporting our operations. In light of the amount and types of functions that we will outsource, these service provider risks could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe participate in a highly competitive market, and pressure from existing and new companies may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe face significant competition from companies that provide listings, information, lead generation, and recreation vehicle buying services designed to reach consumers and enable dealers to reach these consumers. We will compete for a share of overall recreation vehicle purchases as well as recreation vehicle dealer\u2019s marketing and technology spend. To the extent that recreation vehicle dealers view alternative strategies to be superior to RumbleON, we may not be able to maintain or grow the number of dealers in our network, we may sell fewer recreation vehicles to users of our platform, and our business, operating results and financial condition will be harmed.\nWe also expect that new competitors will continue to enter the online recreation vehicle retail industry with competing products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue, business and financial results.\nOur competitors could significantly impede our ability to expand our network of dealers and to reach consumers. Our competitors may also develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future products and services less competitive, unmarketable or obsolete. In addition, if our competitors develop products or services with similar or superior functionality to our solutions, we may need to decrease the prices for our solutions in order to remain competitive. If we are unable to maintain our current pricing structure due to competitive pressures, our revenue will be reduced and our operating results will be negatively affected.\nOur current and potential competitors may have significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have, and the ability to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and support of their products and services. Additionally, they may have more extensive recreation vehicle industry relationships than we have, longer operating histories and greater name recognition. As a result, these competitors may be better able to respond more quickly to undertake more extensive marketing or promotional campaigns. If we are unable to compete with these companies, the demand for our products and services could substantially decline.\nIn addition, if one or more of our competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Our competitors may also establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future third-party data providers, technology partners, or other parties with whom we may have relationships, thereby limiting our ability to develop, improve, and promote our solutions. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors, and competitive pressures may harm our revenue, business and financial results.\nSeasonality or weather trends may cause fluctuations in our unique visitors, revenue and operating results.\nOur revenue trends are likely to be a reflection of consumers' recreation vehicle buying patterns. While different types of recreation vehicles are designed for different seasons (motorcycles are typically for non-snow seasons, while snowmobiles are typically designed for winter), our revenue may be cyclical if, for example, motorcycles and motorcycle dealers represent a large percentage of our revenue. Our business will also be impacted by cyclical trends affecting the overall economy, specifically the retail recreation vehicle industry, as well as by actual or threatened severe weather events.\nWe collect, process, store, share, disclose and use personal information and other data, and our actual or perceived failure to protect such information and data could damage our reputation and brand and harm our business and operating results.\nWe collect, process, store, share, disclose and use personal information and other data provided by consumers and dealers. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to effect secure transmission of such information. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. Any failure or perceived failure to maintain the security of personal and other data that is provided to us by consumers and dealers could harm our reputation and brand and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, any of which could harm our business and operating results. In addition, from time to time, it is possible that concerns will be expressed about whether our products, services, or processes compromise the privacy of our users. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could harm our business and operating results.\nThere are numerous federal, state and local laws around the world regarding privacy and the collection, processing, storing, sharing, disclosing, using and protecting of personal information and other data, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and which may be costly to comply with and may be inconsistent between countries and jurisdictions or conflict with other rules. We generally comply with industry standards and are subject to the terms of our privacy policies and privacy-related obligations to third parties. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection, to the extent possible. However, it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in new ways or in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices or that new regulations could be enacted. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to consumers or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of sensitive information, which may include personally identifiable information or other user data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause consumers and recreation vehicle dealers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if vendors, developers or other third parties that we work with violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also put consumer or dealer information at risk and could in turn harm our reputation, business and operating results.\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm our business and operating results.\nA portion of our success may be dependent on our intellectual property, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our business. We expect to rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property. In addition, we will attempt to protect our intellectual property, technology, and confidential information by requiring our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements and third parties to enter into nondisclosure agreements. These agreements may not effectively prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property, or technology and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property, or technology. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our website features, software, and functionality or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary.\nCompetitors may adopt service names similar to ours, thereby harming our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to user confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of the term \"RumbleON\u201d or \"RMBL.\"\nWe currently hold the \"RumbleON.com\" Internet domain name and various other related domain names. The regulation of domain names in the United States is subject to change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars, or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may not be able to acquire or maintain all domain names that use the name RumbleON or RMBL.\nWe may in the future be subject to intellectual property disputes, which are costly to defend and could harm our business and operating results.\nWe may from time to time face allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including from our competitors or non-practicing entities.\nPatent and other intellectual property litigation may be protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict and may require us to stop offering some features, purchase licenses or modify our products and features while we develop non-infringing substitutes or may result in significant settlement costs.\nIn addition, we use open source software in our products and will use open source software in the future. From time to time, we may face claims against companies that incorporate open source software into their products, claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the source code, the open source software or derivative works that were developed using such software, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could also result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly license or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our platform or services, any of which would have a negative effect on our business and operating results.\nEven if these matters do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, these matters, and the time and resources necessary to litigate or resolve them, could harm our business, our operating results and our reputation.\nWe depend on key personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain, attract and integrate qualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmed.\nWe believe our success will depend on the efforts and talents of our executives and employees, including Marshall Chesrown, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Steven R. Berrard, our Chief Financial Officer and Secretary. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. In addition, the loss of any of our senior management or key employees could materially adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and strategy, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements on a timely basis, or at all. Our executive officers are at-will employees, which means they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may acquire other companies or technologies, which could divert our management's attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to grow our business in response to the demands of consumers, dealers and other constituents within the recreation vehicle industry as well as competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may determine to do so through the acquisition of complementary businesses and technologies rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions. The risks we face in connection with acquisitions include:\n\u25cf\ndiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges;\n\u25cf\ncoordination of technology, research and development and sales and marketing functions;\n\u25cf\ntransition of the acquired company's users to our website and mobile applications;\n\u25cf\nretention of employees from the acquired company;\n\u25cf\ncultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;\n\u25cf\nintegration of the acquired company's accounting, management information, human resources, and other administrative systems;\n\u25cf\nthe need to implement or improve controls, procedures, and policies at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked effective controls, procedures, and policies;\n\u25cf\npotential write-offs of intangibles or other assets acquired in such transactions that may have an adverse effect our operating results in a given period;\n\u25cf\nliability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n\u25cf\nlitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, consumers, former stockholders, or other third parties.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally. Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses, or the impairment of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. Also, the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions may not materialize to the extent we anticipate or at all.\nWe may not be able to protect our proprietary technology.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, protect our trade secrets and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We may rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection, and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property of our products and services. Patents might not be issued or granted with respect to our patent applications that are currently pending, and issued or granted patents might later be found to be invalid or unenforceable, be interpreted in a manner that does not adequately protect our business, or fail to otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. As such, we do not know the degree of future protection, if any, that we will have on what we consider our intellectual property, if any, and a failure to obtain adequate intellectual property protection with respect to our technology and marketplace solutions could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIf we must spend significant time and money protecting or enforcing our intellectual property rights our business, results of operations and financial condition may be harmed.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nThere has been a limited public market for our common stock, and we do not know if one will develop that will provide you with adequate liquidity. The trading price for our common stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations.\nAlthough our common stock is listed for trading on the Over-the-Counter Pink Sheets (\"OTCPK\") under the trading symbol \"RMBL,\" and we intend to apply for the Over-the-Counter Quotation Board (\"OTCQB\"), we cannot assure you that we will meet OTCQB's listing requirements, and therefore may not be able to meet the standards for such listing. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common stock will develop. The liquidity of any market for the shares of our common stock will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe number of stockholders;\n\u25cf\nour operating performance and financial condition;\n\u25cf\nthe market for similar securities;\n\u25cf\nthe extent of coverage of us by securities or industry analysts; and\n\u25cf\nthe interest of securities dealers in making a market in the shares of our common stock.\nHistorically, the market for equity securities has also been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of these securities, which may not have corresponded to the business or financial success of the particular company. We cannot assure you that the market for the shares of our common stock will be free from similar disruptions. Any such disruptions could have an adverse effect on stockholders. In addition, the price of the shares of our common stock could decline significantly if our future operating results fail to meet or exceed the expectations of market analysts and investors.\nEven if an active trading market develops, the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. Some of the facts that could negatively affect our share price include:\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and an even greater percentage of the Company's voting power and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nFollowing the NextGen Acquisition and the Effective Date, our executive officers and directors beneficially own approximately 81.6% of our voting stock, representing 91.1% in aggregate voting power, including 80.2% in aggregate voting power held by Messrs. Chesrown and Berrard as the only holders of our 1,000,000 outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, which has 10 votes for each one share outstanding. As a result, these stockholders have the ability to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders are able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may believe are in your best interest as a stockholder or to take other action that you may believe are not in your best interest as a stockholder.\nThe pro forma financial statements were presented for illustrative purposes only and may not be an indication of our financial condition or results of operations following the NextGen Acquisition.\nThe pro forma financial statements we have filed with the SEC in connection with the NextGen Acquisition were presented for illustrative purposes only and may not be an indication of our financial condition or results of operations following the NextGen Acquisition for several reasons. For example, the pro forma financial statements were derived from our historical financial statements and NextGen\u2019s, and certain adjustments and assumptions have been made regarding us after giving effect to the NextGen Acquisition. The information upon which these adjustments and assumptions have been made is preliminary, and these kinds of adjustments and assumptions are difficult to make with accuracy. Moreover, our actual financial condition and results of operations following the NextGen Acquisition may not be consistent with, or evident from, the pro forma financial statements.\nIn addition, the assumptions used in preparing the pro forma financial data may not prove to be accurate, and other factors may affect our financial condition or results of operations following the NextGen Acquisition. Any potential decline in our financial condition or results of operations may cause significant variations in the trading price of our securities.\nBecause our common stock is deemed a low-priced \"penny\" stock, an investment in our common stock should be considered high risk and subject to marketability restrictions.\nSince our common stock is a penny stock, as defined in Rule 3a51-1 under the Exchange Act, it will be more difficult for investors to liquidate their investment even if and when a market develops for the common stock. Until the trading price of the common stock rises above $5.00 per share, if ever, trading in the common stock is subject to the penny stock rules of the Exchange Act specified in rules 15g-1 through 15g-10. Those rules require broker-dealers, before effecting transactions in any penny stock, to:\n\u25cf\ndeliver to the customer, and obtain a written receipt for, a disclosure document;\n\u25cf\ndisclose certain price information about the stock;\n\u25cf\ndisclose the amount of compensation received by the broker-dealer or any associated person of the broker-dealer;\n\u25cf\nsend monthly statements to customers with market and price information about the penny stock; and\n\u25cf\nin some circumstances, approve the purchaser\u2019s account under certain standards and deliver written statements to the customer with information specified in the rules.\nConsequently, the penny stock rules may restrict the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to sell the common stock and may affect the ability of holders to sell their common stock in the secondary market and the price at which such holders can sell any such securities. These additional procedures could also limit our ability to raise additional capital in the future.\nOur internal controls may be inadequate which could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation being disseminated to the public.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f), internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the principal executive and principal financial officer and effected by the board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Exchange Act rule includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no or few securities or industry analysts commence coverage of us, the trading price for our stock would be negatively impacted. In the event we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, if any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, our intellectual property or our stock performance, or if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur annual and quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly or may fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, each of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to annual and quarterly fluctuations, and they will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u25cf\na change in consumer discretionary spending;\n\u25cf\nweather, which may impact the ability or desire for potential end customers to consider whether they wish to own a recreation vehicle;\n\u25cf\nthe timing and cost of, and level of investment in, research and development activities relating to our software services, which may change from time to time;\n\u25cf\nour ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel;\n\u25cf\nexpenditures that we will or may incur to acquire or develop additional product and service offerings;\n\u25cf\nfuture accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies; and\n\u25cf\nthe changing and volatile U.S., European and global economic environments.\nIf our annual or quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any annual or quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that annual and quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nRaising additional funds through debt or equity financing could be dilutive and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take certain actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic collaborations or partnerships, or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may be required to limit valuable rights to our intellectual property, technologies, or future revenue streams, or grant licenses or other rights on terms that are not favorable to us. Furthermore, any additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and grow our business.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nIn connection with the NextGen Acquisition, stockholders holding 7,898,809 shares of our common stock have entered into an Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement (the \"Stockholders Agreement\") restricting the stockholders\u2019 ability to transfer shares of our common stock through the earlier of (i) October 19, 2017, or (ii) the date on which the Company receives at least $3,500,000 in proceeds of any equity financing (the \"Restricted Period\"), subject to certain exceptions. The Stockholders Agreement limits the number of shares of our common stock that may be sold immediately following the NextGen Acquisition. Subject to certain limitations, including sales volume limitations with respect to shares held by our affiliates, substantially all of our outstanding shares prior to the NextGen Acquisition will become eligible for sale upon expiration of the Restricted Period. Sales of stock by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase our common stock could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe expect that additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations, particularly to fund inventory purchases or develop additional software. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell our common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell our common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. These sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company\" under the JOBS Act of 2012, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (\"JOBS Act\"), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \"emerging growth companies\" including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \"emerging growth company\" can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\") for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \"emerging growth company\" can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are choosing to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nWe will remain an \"emerging growth company\" for up to five years, although we will lose that status sooner if our revenue exceeds $1 billion, if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period, or if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million.\nEven if we no longer qualify as an \"emerging growth company\", we may still be subject to reduced reporting requirements so long as we are considered a \"smaller reporting company.\"\nMany of the exemptions available for emerging growth companies are also available to smaller reporting companies like us that have less than $75 million of worldwide common equity held by non-affiliates. So, although we may no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still be subject to reduced reporting requirements.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties.\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, and others to protect our proprietary rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every market in which our products and services are made available. We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all markets in which we do business. Furthermore, regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\nWe may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights.\nWe also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights.\nOther parties also may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights. We may be subject to claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us or the payment of damages. We may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights, but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, we may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us, or at all, licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims.", "PERMNO": 16999, "SIC": 5961, "TIC": "RMBL"}
