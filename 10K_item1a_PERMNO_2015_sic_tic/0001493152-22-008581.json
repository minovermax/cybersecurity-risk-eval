{"cik": "1642375", "company": "Guardion Health Sciences, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in the Company\u2019s common stock involves a high degree of risk. Prospective investors should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included or referred to in this Form 10-K, before purchasing shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. There are numerous and varied risks that may prevent the Company from achieving its goals. If any of these risks actually occurs, the business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline and investors in the Company\u2019s common stock could lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business\nAs the Company has incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows since its inception, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to reach and sustain profitability. If it cannot reach and sustain profitability, the Company will be required to secure additional financing, which the Company may not be able to obtain on favorable terms or at all.\nThe Company has incurred net losses since inception in 2009 and cannot be certain if or when the Company will produce sufficient revenue from operations to support costs. The Company had a net loss of $24,745,009 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and a net loss of $8,571,657 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company had an accumulated deficit of $78,802,072 as of December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2021, the Company had cash and short term investments on hand of $9,089,550 and working capital of $10,910,139. In addition, the Company completed an offering in February 2022 that generated additional net cash proceeds of approximately $10 million. Notwithstanding the net loss for 2021, management believes that its current cash balance is sufficient to fund operations for at least one year from the date the Company\u2019s 2021 financial statements are issued.\nThe Company will continue to incur significant expenses related to the commercialization of its products and with respect to its efforts to build its infrastructure, expand its operations, and execute on its business plans.\nEven if profitability is achieved in the future, the Company may not be able to sustain profitability on a consistent basis. The Company expects to continue to incur substantial losses and negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future. The Company\u2019s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.\nThe Company does not have any credit facilities as a source of present or future funds, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all. The Company may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings and debt financings. If the Company raises additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of the Company\u2019s stockholders could be significantly diluted, and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. Debt financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting the ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, would increase expenses and may require that Company assets secure such debt.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing in the future will be subject to a number of factors, including but not limited to, market conditions, operating performance and investor sentiment. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, the Company may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue its operations or obtain funds by entering into agreements on unattractive terms, which would likely have a material adverse effect on its business, stock price and relationships with third parties, at least until additional funding is obtained. If the Company does not have sufficient funds to continue operations, the Company could be required to seek other alternatives that would likely result in the Company\u2019s stockholders losing some or all of their investment.\nThe future success of the Company\u2019s business is largely dependent upon the successful commercialization of its products. If the Company is unable to establish and maintain adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into or maintain agreements with third parties to do so, it may be unable to successfully commercialize its products. Establishing and maintaining sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities is expensive and time-consuming. Such expenses may be disproportionate compared to the revenues the Company may be able to generate from sales. If this occurs, it will have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operations and its ability to fund future development and commercialization efforts.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has and may continue to adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, including the commercialization of the Company\u2019s products, supply chain, clinical trials, liquidity and access to capital markets and business development activities.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. The President of the United States declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national emergency and many states and municipalities in the Unites States announced aggressive actions to reduce the spread of the disease, including limiting non-essential gatherings of people, ceasing all non-essential travel, ordering certain businesses and government agencies to cease non-essential operations at physical locations and issuing \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders which direct individuals to shelter at their places of residence (subject to limited exceptions). The effects of government actions and the Company\u2019s policies and those of third parties to reduce the spread of COVID-19 may negatively impact productivity and the Company\u2019s ability to market and sell its products, cause disruptions to its supply chain and impair its ability to execute its business development strategy. These and other disruptions in the Company\u2019s operations and the global economy could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe commercialization of the Company\u2019s products may be adversely impacted by COVID-19 and actions taken to slow its spread. For example, patients may postpone visits to retailers, and healthcare provider facilities, certain healthcare providers may temporarily close their offices or restrict patient visits, healthcare provider employees may become generally unavailable and there could be disruptions in the operations of payors, distributors, logistics providers and other third parties that are necessary for the Company\u2019s products to be recommended and administered to patients.\nQuarantines, shelter-in-place and similar government orders, or the perception that such orders, shutdowns or other restrictions on the conduct of business operations could occur, related to COVID-19 or other infectious diseases could impact personnel at third-party manufacturing facilities upon which the Company relies, or the availability or cost of materials, which could disrupt the supply chain for the Company\u2019s products.\nMoreover, the Company has been experiencing supply chain constraints due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These constraints began in December 2021 and have continued into 2022. These constraints have impacted the Company\u2019s ability to obtain inventory to fulfill customer orders for its Viactiv branded products and may continue to impact the Company\u2019s ability to fulfill customer orders going forward which would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. The Company continues to experience challenges to meet customer demands, largely because of broad-based shortages in suppliers\u2019 labor which impact the availability of many critical components in the Company\u2019s supply chain and distribution. We are subject to out-of-stock fees to certain retailers in the event that we are unable to adequately maintain certain inventory levels of our Viactiv products. Additionally, the Company and its suppliers are experiencing significant broad-based inflation of manufacturing and distribution costs as well as transportation challenges. The Company expects shortages to continue at least through the first half of 2022 and input cost inflation to continue at least throughout 2022.\nThe spread of COVID-19 and actions taken to reduce its spread may also materially affect the Company economically. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken to slow its spread, the global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. If the equity and credit markets continue to deteriorate, it may make any additional debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly or more dilutive. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, there could be a significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing the Company\u2019s ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect the Company\u2019s liquidity and financial position or the Company\u2019s business development activities.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the commercialization of the Company\u2019s products, supply chain, access to capital and business development activities, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the pandemic, the duration of the pandemic and the efforts by governments and business to contain it, business closures or business disruptions and the impact on the economy and capital markets.\nThe Company has limited experience in developing dietary supplements and medical foods and it may be unable to commercialize some of the products it develops or acquires.\nDevelopment and commercialization of dietary supplements and medical foods involves a lengthy and complex process. The Company has limited experience in developing products and has only a few commercialized products on the market. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that any newly developed products will be marketable or that the Company will achieve commercial success with any new products or product lines.\nEven if the Company develops or acquires products for commercial use, these products may not be accepted by the consumer, or medical marketplaces or be capable of being offered at prices that will enable the Company to become profitable. The Company cannot assure you that its products will be approved by regulatory authorities, if required, or ultimately prove to be useful for commercial markets, meet applicable regulatory standards, or be successfully marketed.\nThe Company\u2019s investment in new businesses and new products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and could disrupt its current operations.\nThe Company has invested and expects to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies. Such endeavors involve significant risks and uncertainties, including insufficient revenues from such investments to offset any new liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments, inadequate return of capital on the Company\u2019s investments, distraction of management from current operations, and unidentified issues not discovered in its due diligence of such strategies and offerings that could cause the Company to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such investments and incur unanticipated liabilities. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nA key part of the Company\u2019s business strategy is to establish collaborative relationships to commercialize and develop its products. The Company may not succeed in establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships, which may significantly limit its ability to develop and commercialize its products successfully, if at all.\nA key part of the Company\u2019s business strategy is to establish collaborative relationships to commercialize and fund development of its products.\nWhile the Company believes that these collaborative relationships help further validate its products, these relationships are not material to the Company because these relationships are not exclusive, there are many potential collaborative partners available, and the Company and each collaborator is free to enter into other collaborative relationships as needed.\nThe Company may not be able to negotiate collaborations on acceptable terms, if at all, and if it does enter into collaborations, these collaborations may not be successful. The Company\u2019s current and future success depends in part on its ability to enter into successful collaboration arrangements. If the Company is unable to establish and maintain collaborative relationships on acceptable terms or to successfully transition terminated collaborative agreements, the Company may have to delay or discontinue further development of one or more of its product candidates, undertake development and commercialization activities at its own expense or find alternative sources of capital. Consequently, if it is unable to enter into, maintain or extend successful collaborations, the Company\u2019s business may be harmed.\nThe Company\u2019s long-term success may depend upon the successful development and commercialization of products other than its current products.\nThe Company\u2019s long-term viability and growth may depend upon the successful development and commercialization of products other than its current line of products. Product development and commercialization is very expensive and involves a high degree of risk. Only a small number of research and development programs result in the commercialization of a product. Product development is a complex and time-consuming process. If the Company fails to adequately manage the research, development, execution and regulatory aspects of new product development it may fail to launch new products altogether.\nPatent litigation is common in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries. Any litigation or claim against the Company may cause it to incur substantial costs and could place a significant strain on its financial resources, divert the attention of management from its business and harm the Company\u2019s reputation.\nWhile the Company is not a pharmaceutical or a biopharmaceutical company, as a health sciences company, the Company\u2019s products may come into competition with products in the medical foods and related industries, such as pharmaceuticals, biologics or dietary supplements. There has been substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries with respect to the manufacture, use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights. For the most part, these lawsuits relate to the validity, enforceability and infringement of patents. The Company currently relies upon and expects to continue to rely upon patents, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain its competitive position. The Company may find it necessary to initiate claims to defend its intellectual property rights as a result. Other parties may have issued patents or be issued patents that may prevent the sale of the Company\u2019s products or know-how or require the Company to license such patents and pay significant fees or royalties to produce its products. In addition, future patents may be issued to third parties which the Company\u2019s technology may infringe on. Because patent applications can take many years to be issued, there may be applications now pending of which the Company is unaware that may later result in issued patents that the Company\u2019s products may infringe on.\nIntellectual property litigation, regardless of outcome, is expensive and time-consuming, and could divert management\u2019s attention from the Company\u2019s business and have a material negative effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating results or financial condition. If such a dispute were to be resolved against the Company, it may be required to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees to the party claiming infringement if the Company were to be found to have willfully infringed a third party\u2019s patent. The Company may also have to develop non-infringing technology, stop selling any products it develops, cease using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property or enter into royalty or license agreements that may not be available on acceptable or commercially practical terms, if at all. The Company\u2019s failure to develop non-infringing technologies or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis could harm its business. Modification of any products the Company develops or development of new products thereafter could require the Company to become subject to other requirements of the FDA and other regulatory bodies, which could be time-consuming and expensive. In addition, parties making infringement claims may be able to obtain an injunction that would prevent the Company from selling any products it develops, which could harm its business.\nCompetitors may develop products similar to the Company\u2019s products, and the Company may therefore need to modify or alter its business strategy, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nCompetitors may develop products with similar characteristics to the Company\u2019s products. Such similar products marketed by larger competitors could hinder the Company\u2019s efforts to penetrate the market.\nMany large competitors have substantially greater financial, research and development, manufacturing and marketing experience and resources as well as greater brand recognition than the Company does and represent substantial long-term competition for the Company. Such companies may develop products that are safer, more effective or less costly than any that the Company may develop. Such companies also may be more successful than the Company is in manufacturing, sales and marketing.\nAs a result, the Company may be forced to modify or alter its business and regulatory strategy and sales and marketing plans, as a response to changes in the market, competition and technology limitations, among others. Such modifications may pose additional delays in achieving the Company\u2019s goals which may have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nIf the Company is unable to develop its own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, or if it is not successful in contracting with third parties for these services on favorable terms, or at all, revenues from product sales could be limited.\nTo commercialize the Company\u2019s products successfully, the Company must develop more robust capabilities internally or collaborate with third parties that can perform these services. In the process of commercializing the Company\u2019s products, the Company may not be able to hire the necessary experienced personnel and build sales, marketing and distribution operations capable of successfully launching new products and generating sufficient product revenues. In addition, establishing such operations takes time and involves significant expense.\nIf the Company decides to enter into co-promotion or other licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be unable to identify acceptable partners because the number of potential partners is limited and because of competition from others for similar alliances with potential partners. Even if the Company is able to identify one or more acceptable partners, it may not be able to enter into any partnering arrangements on favorable terms, or at all. If the Company enters into any partnering arrangements, its revenues are likely to be lower than if the Company marketed and sold its products itself.\nIn addition, any revenues the Company receives would depend upon its partners\u2019 efforts which may not be adequate due to lack of attention or resource commitments, management turnover, and change of strategic focus, further business combinations or other factors outside of its control. Depending upon the terms of the Company\u2019s agreements, the remedies the Company against an under-performing partner may be limited. If the Company were to terminate the relationship, it may be difficult or impossible to find a replacement partner on acceptable terms, or at all.\nProduct liability lawsuits against the Company could divert its resources and could cause it to incur substantial liabilities and limit commercialization of its products.\nThe Company faces a risk of product liability exposure related to the use of its products. If the Company cannot successfully defend itself against claims that its products caused injuries, the Company will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf decreased demand for any current products or products that the Company may develop;\n\u25cf injury to the Company\u2019s reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u25cf significant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u25cf loss of revenue; and\n\u25cf reduced time and attention of the Company\u2019s management to pursue the Company\u2019s business strategy.\nThe Company\u2019s insurance policies may not fully cover liabilities that it may incur in the event of a product liability lawsuit. The Company may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nThe Company may be unsuccessful in expanding its product distributions.\nThe Company is dependent on third-party sales broker and distribution relationships. These brokers and distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell the Company\u2019s products to the level of the Company\u2019s expectations. If sales brokers and distributors do not perform adequately, or if the Company is unable to locate distributors in particular geographic areas, the Company\u2019s ability to realize long-term revenue growth would be materially adversely affected.\nAdditionally, the Company\u2019s products may require regulatory clearances and approvals from jurisdictions outside the United States. The Company expects that it will be subject to and required to comply with local regulatory requirements before selling its products in those jurisdictions. The Company is not certain that it will be able to obtain these clearances or approvals or compliance requirements on a timely basis, or at all.\nThe Company has historically sold its products to customers outside the U.S. and may sell products outside of the United States in 2022 and beyond. As a result, the Company\u2019s business is exposed to risks inherent in international operations. These risks, which can vary substantially by location, include the following:\n\u25cf governmental laws, regulations and policies adopted to manage national economic and macroeconomic conditions, such as increases in taxes, austerity measures that may impact consumer spending, monetary policies that may impact inflation rates, currency fluctuations and sustainability of resources;\n\u25cf changes in environmental, health and safety regulations, such as the continued implementation of the European Union\u2019s Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals regulations and similar regulations that are being evaluated and adopted in other markets, and the burdens and costs of our compliance with such regulations;\n\u25cf increased environmental, health and safety regulations or the loss of necessary environmental permits in certain countries, arising from growing consumer sensitivity concerning the inclusion of flavor additives in food products and the fact that regulators perceive dietary supplements, medical foods and functional food products as having medicinal attributes;\n\u25cf the imposition of or changes in tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, by the U.S. or other countries, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s cost or ability to import raw materials or export its flavors and fragrance products to surrounding markets;\n\u25cf risks and costs arising from language and cultural differences;\n\u25cf changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in the countries in which the Company operates, including the risk of expropriation or nationalization, and the costs and ability to repatriate the profit that the Company generates in these countries;\n\u25cf risks and costs associated with political and economic instability, bribery and corruption, anti-American sentiment, and social and ethnic unrest in the countries in which the Company operates;\n\u25cf difficulty in recruiting and retaining trained local personnel;\n\u25cf natural disasters, pandemics or international conflicts, including terrorist acts, or national and regional labor strikes in the countries in which the Company operates, which could interrupt our operations or endanger its personnel; or\n\u25cf the risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation, application and enforceability of laws and regulations and the enforceability of contract rights and intellectual property rights.\nManufacturing risks and inefficiencies may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to produce products.\nThe Company engages third parties to manufacture its products in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis, while maintaining product quality, acceptable manufacturing costs and complying with regulatory requirements. In determining the required quantities of its products and the manufacturing schedule, the Company must make significant judgments and estimates based on historical experience, inventory levels, current market trends and other related factors. Because of the inherent nature of estimates, there could be significant differences between the Company\u2019s estimates and the actual amounts of products it requires. If the Company is unable to obtain from one or more of its vendors the needed materials or components that meet our specifications on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, the Company may not be able to meet the demand for its products. While the Company has not arranged for alternate suppliers, and it may be difficult to find alternate suppliers in a timely manner and on terms acceptable to the Company, the Company believes that there are alternative sources, suppliers and manufacturers available for its products in the event of a termination or a disagreement with any current vendor. Additionally, the Company\u2019s supply chain may be jeopardized for a period of time due to the COVID-19 outbreak or challenges related to supply chain constraints.\nThe Company has been experiencing supply chain constraints due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These constraints began in approximately December 2021 and have continued into 2022. These constraints have impacted our ability the Company\u2019s ability to obtain inventory to fulfill customer orders for its Viactiv branded products and may continue to impact its ability to fulfill customer orders going forward which would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. The Company continues to experience challenges to meet customer demands, largely because of broad-based shortages in suppliers\u2019 labor which impact the availability of many critical components in the Company\u2019s supply chain and distribution. The Company is subject to out-of-stock fees to certain retailers in the event that the Company is unable to adequately maintain certain inventory levels of our Viactiv products. Additionally, the Company and its suppliers are experiencing significant broad-based inflation of manufacturing and distribution costs as well as transportation challenges. The Company expects shortages to continue at least through the first half of 2022 and input cost inflation to continue at least throughout 2022.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise the Company\u2019s information and expose it to liability, which would cause its business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of the Company\u2019s business, the Company collects and stores sensitive data, including intellectual property, its proprietary business information and that of its customers and business partners, including potentially personally identifiable information of its customers, some of which is stored on the Company\u2019s network and some of which is stored with the Company\u2019s third-party e-commerce vendor. Despite the Company\u2019s security measures, its information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise the Company\u2019s network and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt the Company\u2019s operations, and damage the Company\u2019s reputation, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s billings and revenues are derived from a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or more of them may have an immediate adverse effect on its financial results.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company\u2019s billings were derived from a limited number of individual customers and distributors. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company\u2019s clinical nutrition business had one customer who accounted for approximately 49% of the Company\u2019s sales; and during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s clinical nutrition business had one customer who accounted for approximately 47% of the Company\u2019s sales. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of sales in either year. Customers may stop purchasing the Company\u2019s products with little or no warning. Loss of customers may have an immediate adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial results.\nIf customers do not accept the Company\u2019s products or delay in deciding whether to recommend the Company\u2019s products, its business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s business model depends on its ability to sell its products. Third party brokers play an important role in the sales of the Viactiv line of supplements since the majority of these sales are made through traditional retailers. The Company utilizes these brokers to sell to it retail customers rather than employing an internal sales force. The Company cannot assure you that these brokers will be successful in selling its products to traditional retail customers. In addition, acceptance of the Company\u2019s products greatly benefits from physicians who understand and appreciate the benefits of Lumega-Z and GlaucoCetin and recommend them to their patients. The Company cannot assure you that physicians will integrate its products into their treatment plans or patient recommendations. Achieving market acceptance for the Company\u2019s products and services will require substantial sales and marketing efforts and the expenditure of significant financial and other resources to create awareness and demand by participants in the healthcare industry. If the Company fails to achieve broad acceptance of its products by physicians, and other healthcare industry participants or if the Company fails to position its products as an ocular health remedy, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company is highly dependent upon consumers\u2019 perception of the safety and quality of its products as well as similar products distributed by other companies in its industry, and adverse publicity and negative public perception regarding particular ingredients or products or the Company\u2019s industry in general could limit the Company\u2019s ability to increase revenue and grow our business.\nDecisions about purchasing made by consumers of the Company\u2019s products may be affected by adverse publicity or negative public perception regarding particular ingredients or products or the Company\u2019s industry in general. This negative public perception may include publicity regarding the legality or quality of particular ingredients or products in general or of other companies or our products or ingredients specifically. Negative public perception may also arise from regulatory investigations, regardless of whether those investigations involve the Company. The Company is highly dependent upon consumers\u2019 perception of the safety and quality of its products as well as similar products distributed by other companies. Thus, the mere publication of reports asserting that such products may be harmful could have a material adverse effect on the Company, regardless of whether these reports are scientifically supported. Publicity related to nutritional supplements may also result in increased regulatory scrutiny of the Company\u2019s industry and/or the healthy foods channel. Adverse publicity may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf the Company is deemed to infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties, it could incur unanticipated expense and be prevented from providing its products.\nThe Company could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of its competitors grows and if its products or the functionality of its products overlap with patents of the Company\u2019s competitors. While the Company does not believe that it has infringed or is infringing on any proprietary rights of third parties, the Company cannot assure you that infringement claims will not be asserted against it or that those claims will be unsuccessful. The Company could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources defending any infringement claims whether or not such claims are ultimately successful. Furthermore, a party making a claim against the Company could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block the Company\u2019s ability to provide products. In addition, the Company cannot assure you that licenses for any intellectual property of third parties that might be required for its products will be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on its intellectual property rights, and if it is unable to protect them, its competitive position may suffer.\nProtecting the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights is critical to its continued success and its ability to maintain its competitive position. The Company\u2019s goal is to protect its proprietary rights through a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law, confidentiality agreements and technical measures. The Company generally enters into non-disclosure agreements with its employees and consultants and limits access to its trade secrets and technology. The Company cannot assure you that the steps it has taken will prevent misappropriation of its intellectual property. Misappropriation of the Company\u2019s intellectual property would have an adverse effect on its competitive position.\nThe Company\u2019s success, competitive position, and future revenues will depend, in part, on its ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for its products, methods and processes; to preserve its trade secrets; to obtain trademarks for its name, logo and products; to prevent third parties from infringing its proprietary rights; and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. To counter infringement or unauthorized use by third parties, the Company may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming.\nThe patent process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in protecting its products by obtaining and defending patents. These risks and uncertainties include the following:\n\u25cf claims of issued patents, and the claims of any patents which may be issued in the future and be owned by or licensed to the Company may be challenged by third parties, resulting in patents being deemed invalid, unenforceable, or narrowed in scope, a third party may circumvent any such issued patents, or such issued patents may not provide any significant commercial protection against competing products;\n\u25cf the Company\u2019s competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than the Company does and many of which have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate the Company\u2019s ability to make, use, and sell the Company\u2019s current and future products either in the United States or in international markets; and\n\u25cf the legal systems of some foreign countries do not encourage the aggressive enforcement of patents, and countries other than the United States may have less restrictive patent laws than those upheld by United States courts, allowing foreign competitors the ability to exploit these laws to create, develop, and market competing products. Thus, the Company\u2019s foreign patents may not be enforceable to the same extent as the counterpart U.S. patents.\nIn addition, the USPTO, and patent offices in other jurisdictions have often required that patent applications concerning pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application, thereby limiting the scope of protection against competitive challenges. Thus, even if the Company or any of its licensors are able to obtain patents, the patents may be substantially narrower than anticipated.\nThe Company must attract and retain quality management and employees in order to manage its growth. Failure to do so may result in slower expansion.\nIn order to support the growth of the Company\u2019s business and the additional obligations that come with being an exchange-listed company, the Company will need to expand its senior management team and attract and retain quality employees. There is no assurance that the Company will be capable of attracting and retaining quality executives and integrating those individuals into the Company\u2019s management system. Without experienced and talented management and employees, the growth of the Company\u2019s business may be adversely impacted.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain qualified members for its board of directors may be impacted due to new potential rules of national securities exchanges.\nNasdaq has adopted new listing rules to become effective on the later of August 8, 2022 and the date a company files its proxy statement for its 2022 annual meeting of stockholders related to board diversity and disclosure, which requires all companies listed on Nasdaq\u2019s U.S. exchanges to publicly disclose consistent, transparent diversity statistics regarding their board of directors. Additionally, the rules require most Nasdaq-listed companies to have, or explain why they do not have, at least two diverse directors, including one who self-identifies as female and one who self-identifies as either an underrepresented minority or LGBTQ+.\nFailure to achieve designated minimum gender and diversity levels in a timely manner exposes such companies to financial penalties and reputational harm. We cannot assure that we can recruit, attract and/or retain qualified members of the board and meet Nasdaq rules, which may expose us to penalties and/or reputational harm.\nThe Company\u2019s acquisition strategy involves a number of risks.\nThe Company is regularly engaged in acquisition discussions with other companies and anticipate that one or more potential acquisition opportunities, including those that would be material or could involve businesses with operating characteristics that differ from the Company\u2019s existing business operations, may become available in the future. If and when appropriate acquisition opportunities become available, the Company intends to pursue them actively. Acquisitions involve a number of risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf failure of the acquired business to achieve expected results, as well as the potential impairment of the acquired assets if operating results decline after acquisition;\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u25cf additional financing, if necessary and available, which could increase leverage and costs, dilute equity, or both;\n\u25cf the potential negative effect on the Company\u2019s financial statements from the increase in goodwill and other intangibles;\n\u25cf difficulties in integrating the operations, systems, technologies, products and personnel of acquired companies;\n\u25cf initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;\n\u25cf the potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the companies the Company acquires after the acquisition;\n\u25cf the high cost and expenses of identifying, negotiating and completing acquisitions; and\n\u25cf risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities.\nThese risks could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company has faced, and expects to continue to face, intense competition for acquisition candidates, which may limit its ability to make acquisitions and may lead to higher acquisition prices. The Company cannot assure you that it will be able to identify, acquire or manage profitably.\nUnfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets, including changes in inflation and overall economic conditions and uncertainties. Inflation could also adversely affect the ability of the Company\u2019s customers to purchase its products. An economic downturn, including as a result of COVID-19, could result in a variety of risks to the Company\u2019s business, including weakened demand for the Company\u2019s products and the Company\u2019s inability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. Any of the foregoing could harm the Company\u2019s business and the Company cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact its business.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Acquisition of Activ Nutritional, LLC\nIntegrating Activ\u2019s business with the Company\u2019s business may be more difficult, costly, or time-consuming than expected, and the Company may not realize the expected benefits of its acquisition of Activ, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf the Company experiences greater than anticipated costs to integrate, or is not able to successfully integrate, Activ\u2019s business into its operations, the Company may not be able to achieve the anticipated benefits of its acquisition of Activ, including cost savings and other synergies and growth opportunities. Even if the integration of Activ\u2019s business is successful, the Company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of its acquisition of Activ during the anticipated time frame, or at all. For example, events outside of the Company\u2019s control, such as changes in regulations and laws, as well as economic trends, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to realize the expected benefits from its acquisition of Activ. An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the Company\u2019s acquisition of Activ could have an adverse effect upon its revenue, level of expenses, and results of operations.\nActiv may have liabilities that are not known to the Company.\nActiv may have liabilities that the Company failed, or was unable, to discover in the course of performing its due diligence investigations in connection with its acquisition of Activ. The Company may learn additional information about Activ that materially and adversely affects the Company and Activ, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and liabilities related to compliance with applicable laws. Moreover, Activ may be subject to audits, reviews, inquiries, investigations, and claims of non-compliance and litigation by federal and state regulatory agencies which could result in liabilities or other sanctions. Any such liabilities or sanctions, individually or in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company has made certain assumptions relating to the Activ acquisition that may prove to be materially inaccurate.\nThe Company has made certain assumptions relating to the Activ acquisition that may prove to be inaccurate, including as the result of the failure to realize the expected benefits of the Activ acquisition, failure to realize expected revenue growth rates, higher than expected operating and transaction costs, as well as general economic and business conditions that adversely affect the Company.\nRisks Related to Government Regulations\nThe Company and its suppliers and manufacturers are subject to a number of existing laws, regulations and industry initiatives and the regulatory environment of the healthcare industry is continuing to change. If it is determined that the Company or its suppliers or manufacturers are not in compliance with the laws and regulations to which they are respectively subject, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nAs a participant in the healthcare industry, the Company\u2019s operations and relationships, and those of the Company\u2019s customers, are regulated by a number of federal, state, local, and foreign governmental entities with oversight of various aspects of product manufacture, distribution, sale, and use. The regulations are very complex, have become more stringent over time, and are subject to changing and varying interpretations. Regulatory restrictions or changes could limit the Company\u2019s ability to carry on or expand its operations or result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales. The FDA and other federal and state governmental agencies regulate numerous elements of the Company\u2019s business, including:\n\u25cf product formulation and development;\n\u25cf pre-clinical and clinical testing;\n\u25cf product labels and labeling;\n\u25cf establishment registration and product listing;\n\u25cf product safety, including product recalls or other field-safety actions;\n\u25cf manufacturing, testing, packaging, storage, distribution;\n\u25cf premarket approval or authorization;\n\u25cf record keeping procedures;\n\u25cf marketing, sales, advertising and promotion;\n\u25cf post-market surveillance, including reporting of adverse events; and\n\u25cf product import and export.\nThe Company may be subject to similar foreign laws that govern all of the above elements of the Company\u2019s business, including pre-market and post marketing obligations for our products. The time required to obtain authorization to sell the Company\u2019s products in foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required by the FDA, and requirements for licensing a product in a foreign country may differ significantly from FDA requirements. In the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), member states are responsible for enforcing the EU\u2019s rules and for ensuring that only compliant products are placed on the market in their jurisdictions. Member states have powers to suspend the marketing and use, or demand the recall, of unsafe or non-compliant medical products. They also have the power to bring enforcement action against companies or individuals for breaches of the rules governing certain medical products.\nThe FDA, FTC, states, and other regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA, FTC, state, or regulatory authorities, which may include the following:\n\u25cf untitled letters or warning letters;\n\u25cf fines, disgorgement, restitution, or civil penalties;\n\u25cf injunctions (e.g., total or partial suspension of production) or consent decrees;\n\u25cf product recalls, administrative detention, or seizure;\n\u25cf customer notifications or product replacement, or refunds;\n\u25cf operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u25cf delays in or refusal to grant requests for future product approvals, new intended uses, or modifications to existing products; and\n\u25cf criminal prosecution.\nAny of these sanctions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDietary supplements, such as Viactiv, and medical foods do not require premarket approval by FDA before they may be distributed in the United States (with limited exceptions). The company currently considers Lumega-Z and GlaucoCetin to be medical foods, as that term is defined under the FDCA. While the Company believes Lumega-Z and GluacoCetin are medical foods, if the FDA determines Lumega-Z or GlaucoCetin to be a \u201cdrug\u201d under the FDCA, the Company and the products would be subject to considerable additional FDA regulation. FDA defines a \u201cdrug\u201d as an article that is intended for use in the cure, treatment, prevention or mitigation of a disease. A medical food is defined as \u201ca food which is formulated to be consumed or administered enterally under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation.\u201d\nOur relationships with healthcare providers may subject us to anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could change or expose us to potential penalties, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings, among other penalties and consequences.\nThe Company cannot anticipate how changes in regulations or determinations by regulatory agencies may evolve. Thus, application of many foreign, state and federal regulations to the Company\u2019s business operations is uncertain. Further, there are federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including anti-kickback laws and limitations on physician referrals that may or may not be directly or indirectly applicable to the Company\u2019s operations and relationships or the business practices of its customers. It is possible that a review of the Company\u2019s business practices or those of its customers by courts or regulatory authorities could result in a determination that may adversely affect the Company. In addition, the healthcare regulatory environment may change in a way that restricts existing operations or growth. The healthcare industry is expected to continue to undergo significant changes for the foreseeable future, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company cannot predict the effect of possible future legislation and regulation.\nIf the Company or its third-party manufacturers fail to comply with FDA cGMP regulations or fail to adequately, timely, or sufficiently respond to an FDA Form 483 or subsequent Warning Letter, this could impair the Company\u2019s ability to market its products in a cost-effective and timely manner and could result in FDA enforcement action.\nThe FDA requires facilities that manufacture FDA-regulated products to comply with cGMP regulations, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of the Company\u2019s products. The Company does not manufacture any of its products internally and instead relies on contract manufacturers to manufacture its products. The Company and its third-party manufacturers are required to comply with cGMP regulations. The FDA audits compliance with cGMP and related regulations through periodic announced and unannounced inspections of manufacturing and other facilities. The FDA may conduct these inspections at any time.\nThe Company\u2019s products and facility, and the facilities of its manufacturers, are subject to federal laws and regulations and certain state laws. Failure to comply with any applicable law or regulation could result in penalties and restrictions on the Company\u2019s manufacturers\u2019 ability to manufacture and the Company\u2019s ability to distribute products. If any such action were to be imposed, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nAlthough the Company\u2019s supplement and food products do not require pre-market approval by the FDA, manufacturers of the Company\u2019s products must be registered with the FDA. Manufacturers of FDA-regulated products are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and state health authorities. The manufacture of the Company\u2019s FDA-regulated products is outsourced in its entirety to three third-party manufacturers. The Company is evaluating additional manufacturers for selection as second source or back-up providers.\nThe Company\u2019s products have not been reviewed by the FDA. There is no certainty that the FDA will favorably review the Company\u2019s products or its manufacturers\u2019 facilities. If the outcome of an inspection is negative or if the Company or the Company\u2019s manufacturers fail to comply with any law or regulation, the Company could be subject to penalties and restrictions on the Company\u2019s manufacturers\u2019 ability to manufacture and distribute products. Any such action may result in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. For a more complete discussion of the laws and regulations to which the Company is subject, see \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation.\u201d\nThe Company may be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions or other administrative actions if it is deemed to be promoting its products outside of their intended use (i.e., as drugs), or if it is using false or misleading claims in its promotional materials.\nThe Company\u2019s business and future growth depend on the development, use and ultimate sale of products that are subject to FDA regulation. Under the FDCA and other laws, the Company is prohibited from promoting its nutritional products for treatment of a condition or disease. The Company\u2019s promotional materials and marketing activities must comply with FDCA, FTCA, and other applicable laws and regulations, including laws and regulations prohibiting marketing claims that promote the use of the Company\u2019s products outside of their intended use as supplements or foods (i.e., as a drug) or that make false or misleading statements. The FDA also could conclude that a performance claim is misleading if it determines that there are inadequate non-clinical and/or clinical data supporting the claim.\nThere is a risk that the FDA or other federal or state law enforcement authorities could determine that the nature and scope of the Company\u2019s sales and marketing activities may constitute the promotion of the Company\u2019s products for use as a drug in violation of applicable law, or that its promotional materials include false or misleading statements. The Company also faces the risk that the FDA or other regulatory authorities might pursue enforcement based on past activities that the Company discontinued or changed, including sales activities, arrangements with institutions and doctors, educational and training programs and other activities.\nGovernment investigations are typically expensive, disruptive, burdensome and generate negative publicity. If its promotional activities are found to be in violation of applicable law or if the Company agrees to a settlement in connection with an enforcement action, the Company would likely face significant fines and penalties and would likely be required to substantially change its sales, promotion and educational activities. In addition, were any enforcement actions against the Company or its senior officers to arise, the Company could be excluded from participation in U.S. government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\nThe Company\u2019s products may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent any required regulatory approval, limit the commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences following any potential marketing approval, or result in a product recall that could harm the Company\u2019s reputation, business and financial results.\nIf the Company\u2019s products are associated with undesirable side effects or adverse events, or have characteristics that are unexpected, the Company may need to abandon its development or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. The Company also may have to remove a commercialized product from the market as consequence of serious adverse events associated with the product. Any serious adverse or undesirable side effects identified during the development of the Company\u2019s products, could interrupt, delay or halt commercialization and/or could result in the additional regulatory requirements by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, and in turn prevent the Company from commercializing its product candidates and generating revenues from their sale.\nCompanies may, under their own initiative, recall a product or the government may mandate a recall. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by the Company or one of its distributors could occur as a result of adverse side effects, impurities or other product contamination, manufacturing errors, labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of any of the Company\u2019s products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the FDA requires companies to maintain certain records of recalls, even if they are not reportable to the FDA. The Company may initiate voluntary recalls involving the Company\u2019s products in the future that it determines do not require notification of the FDA. If the FDA disagrees with the Company\u2019s determinations, it could require the Company to report those actions as recalls. A future recall announcement could harm the Company\u2019s reputation with customers and negatively affect the Company\u2019s sales. In addition, the FDA could take enforcement action for failing to report the recalls when they were conducted.\nIn order to expand the Company\u2019s business into additional jurisdictions, it may need to comply with regulatory requirements specific to such states and there can be no assurance that it will be able to initially meet such requirements or that it will be able to maintain compliance on an on-going basis.\nWhile the Company believes Lumega-Z\u00ae and GlaucoCetinTM to be medical foods and not drugs, they are only available under the supervision of a physician. While not available in pharmacies, the Company is mindful that the act of physicians prescribing, particularly if conducted across state lines, could potentially be subject to certain pharmacy regulations. Each state has its own regulations concerning physician dispensing, restrictions on the corporate practice of medicine, anti-kickback and false claims. In addition, each state has a board of pharmacy that regulates the sale and distribution of drugs and other therapeutic agents. Some states require a physician to obtain a license to dispense prescription products. While the Company does not believe these pharmacy requirements are applicable, should a pharmacy board or medical board determine otherwise, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to comply with the regulations of particular states into which the Company currently does business or may expand, or that we will be able to maintain compliance with the states in which we currently distribute our products.\nThe Company is subject to anti-corruption laws, as well as export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing its operations. If it fails to comply with these laws, it could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures and legal expenses, be precluded from developing manufacturing and selling certain products outside the U.S. or be required to develop and implement costly compliance programs, which could adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, or Bribery Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where the Company does business (including in Malaysia) and may do business in the future, particularly as the Company expands its sales and operations to foreign markets. The Bribery Act, FCPA and these other laws generally prohibit the Company, its officers, and its employees and intermediaries from bribing, being bribed or making other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. Compliance with the FCPA, in particular, is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.\nThe Company may in the future operate in jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential Bribery Act or FCPA violations, and the Company may participate in collaborations and relationships with third parties whose actions could potentially subject the Company to liability under the Bribery Act, FCPA or local anti-corruption laws. In addition, the Company cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which its international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. If the Company expands its operations outside of the U.S., the Company will need to dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which it plans to operate.\nIn addition, various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the U.S., or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If the Company expands its presence outside of the U.S., the Company will be required to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude the Company from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products outside of the U.S., which could limit the Company\u2019s growth potential and increase its development costs.\nThe Company may not be completely effective in ensuring compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the Bribery Act, the FCPA or other legal requirements, including Trade Control laws. If the Company is not in compliance with the Bribery Act, the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws, the Company may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. The Securities and Exchange Commission also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA\u2019s accounting provisions. Any investigation of any potential violations of the Bribery Act, the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws by U.K., U.S. or other authorities could also have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s\u2019 reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nThe Company received a written notice from Nasdaq that it has failed to comply with certain listing requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market, which could result in the Company\u2019s being delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market.\nOn January 25, 2022, the Company received a notification from Nasdaq related to its failure to maintain a minimum bid price of $1 per share. Based upon the closing bid price for the last 30 consecutive business days, the Company no longer meets this requirement. However, the Nasdaq Listing Rules also provide the Company a compliance period of 180 calendar days in which to regain compliance. Accordingly, if at any time from the date of this notice until July 25, 2022, the closing bid price the Company\u2019s common stock is at least $1 for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide the Company with written confirmation of compliance and the matter will be closed. If the Company does not regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement by July 25, 2022, the Company may be afforded a second 180 calendar day period to regain compliance. To qualify, the Company would be required to meet all other initial listing standards, except for the minimum bid price requirement. In addition, the Company would be required to notify Nasdaq of its intent to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period. If the Company does not regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement by the end of the compliance period (or the second compliance period, if applicable), the Company\u2019s common stock will become subject to delisting. If the Company is delisted from Nasdaq, its common stock may be eligible for trading on an over-the-counter market. If the Company is not able to obtain a listing on another stock exchange or quotation service for the Company\u2019s common stock, it may be extremely difficult or impossible for stockholders to sell their shares. The Company intends to monitor the closing bid price of the Company\u2019s common stock and may be required to seek approval from its stockholders to effect a reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. However, there can be no assurance that the reverse stock split would be approved by the Company\u2019s stockholders. Further, there can be no assurance that the market price per new share of the Company\u2019s common stock after the reverse stock split will remain unchanged or increase in proportion to the reduction in the number of old shares of the Company\u2019s common stock outstanding before the reverse stock split. Even if the reverse stock split is approved by the Company\u2019s stockholders, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement or will otherwise be in compliance with other Nasdaq listing rules.\nIf the Company is delisted from Nasdaq, its common stock may be eligible for trading on an over-the-counter market. If the Company is not able to obtain a listing on another stock exchange or quotation service for its common stock, it may be extremely difficult or impossible for stockholders to sell their shares of common stock. Moreover, if the Company is delisted from Nasdaq, but obtains a substitute listing for its common stock, it will likely be on a market with less liquidity, and therefore experience potentially more price volatility than experienced on Nasdaq. Stockholders may not be able to sell their shares of common stock on any such substitute market in the quantities, at the times, or at the prices that could potentially be available on a more liquid trading market. As a result of these factors, if the Company\u2019s common stock is delisted from Nasdaq, the value and liquidity of the Company\u2019s common stock, warrants and pre-funded warrants would likely be significantly adversely affected. A delisting of the Company\u2019s common stock from Nasdaq could also adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain financing for its operations and/or result in a loss of confidence by investors, employees and/or business partners.\nIf the Company implements a reverse stock split, liquidity of its common stock may be adversely effected.\nThe Company may be required to seek approval from its stockholders to effect a reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of its common stock in order to regain compliance with the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement. However, there can be no assurance that the reverse stock split would be approved by the Company\u2019s stockholders. Further, there can be no assurance that the market price per new share of the Company\u2019s common stock after the reverse stock split will remain unchanged or increase in proportion to the reduction in the number of old shares of the Company\u2019s common stock outstanding before the reverse stock split. The liquidity of the shares of the Company\u2019s common stock may be affected adversely by any reverse stock split given the reduced number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock that will be outstanding following the reverse stock split, especially if the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock does not increase as a result of the reverse stock split.\nFollowing any reverse stock split, the resulting market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may not attract new investors and may not satisfy the investing requirements of those investors. Although the Company believes that a higher market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may help generate greater or broader investor interest, there can be no assurance that the reverse stock split will result in a share price that will attract new investors, including institutional investors. In addition, there can be no assurance that the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock will satisfy the investing requirements of those investors. As a result, the trading liquidity of the Company\u2019s common stock may not necessarily improve.\nThe Company is an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and it has elected to comply with certain reduced reporting and disclosure requirements which could make its common stock less attractive to investors.\nThe Company is an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). For as long as the Company continues to be an emerging growth company, it has elected to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), (2) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in the Company\u2019s periodic reports and proxy statements and (3) exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, as an emerging growth company, the Company is only required to provide two years of audited financial statements. As a result of these reduced reporting and disclosure requirements the Company\u2019s financial statements may not be comparable to SEC registrants not classified as emerging growth companies. The Company may be an emerging growth company for up to five years following the first sale the Company\u2019s equity securities in a public offering (April 2019), although circumstances could cause the Company to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of the Company\u2019s common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million before that time or if the Company has total annual gross revenue of $1.07 billion or more during any fiscal year before that time, in which cases the Company would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31 or, if the Company issues more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during any three-year period before that time, the Company would immediately cease to be an emerging growth company. Even after the Company no longer qualifies as an emerging growth company, the Company may still qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d which would allow it to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements. The Company cannot predict if investors will find the Company\u2019s common stock less attractive because the Company may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find the Company\u2019s common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock and the Company\u2019s stock price may be more volatile.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Company has elected to avail itself of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other SEC registrants that are not emerging growth companies.\nInvestors may find the Company\u2019s common stock less attractive as a result of its election to utilize these exemptions, which could result in a less active trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock and/or the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may be more volatile.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price has fluctuated in the past, has been volatile and may be volatile, and as a result, investors in the Company\u2019s common stock could incur substantial losses.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price has fluctuated in the past, has been and may be volatile. The Company may incur rapid and substantial increases or decreases in its stock price in the foreseeable future that are unrelated to its operating performance or prospects. In addition, the recent outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused broad stock market and industry fluctuations. The stock market in general and the market for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may experience losses on their investment in the Company\u2019s common stock. The market price for the Company\u2019s common stock may be influenced by many factors, including the following:\n\u25cf investor reaction to the Company\u2019s business strategy;\n\u25cf the success of competitive products;\n\u25cf the Company\u2019s continued compliance with the listing standards of Nasdaq;\n\u25cf regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries, especially changes in laws or regulations applicable to the Company\u2019s products;\n\u25cf actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to the Company\u2019s products, manufacturing process or sales and marketing terms;\n\u25cf variations in the Company\u2019s financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to the Company;\n\u25cf the success of the Company\u2019s efforts to acquire or in-license additional products;\n\u25cf developments concerning the Company\u2019s collaborations or partners;\n\u25cf declines in the market prices of stocks generally;\n\u25cf trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock;\n\u25cf sales of the Company\u2019s common stock by the Company or its stockholders;\n\u25cf general economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u25cf other events or factors, including those resulting from such events, or the prospect of such events, including war, terrorism and other international conflicts, public health issues including health epidemics or pandemics, such as the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), and natural disasters such as fire, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornados or other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the United States or elsewhere, could disrupt the Company\u2019s operations, disrupt the operations of the Company\u2019s suppliers or result in political or economic instability.\nThese broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock, regardless of its operating performance. Further, recent increases are inconsistent with any improvements in actual or expected operating performance, financial condition or other indicators of value. Since the stock price of the Company\u2019s common stock has fluctuated in the past, has and may be volatile, investors in the Company\u2019s common stock could incur substantial losses. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such litigation, if instituted against the Company could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. There can be no guarantee that the Company\u2019s stock price will remain at current prices or that future sales of the Company\u2019s common stock will not be at prices lower than those sold to investors.\nAdditionally, securities of certain companies have experienced significant and extreme volatility in stock price due short sellers of shares of common stock, known as a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d These short squeezes have caused extreme volatility in those companies and in the market and have led to the price per share of those companies to trade at a significantly inflated rate that is disconnected from the underlying value of the company. Many investors who have purchased shares in those companies at an inflated rate face the risk of losing a significant portion of their original investment as the price per share has declined steadily as interest in those stocks have abated. While the Company has no reason to believe its shares would be the target of a short squeeze, there can be no assurance that the Company will not, in the future be subject to a short squeeze and you may lose a significant portion or all of your investment if you purchase the Company\u2019s shares at a rate that is significantly disconnected from its underlying value.\nThe Company does not intend to pay cash dividends to its stockholders, so you may not receive any return on your investment in the Company prior to selling your interest in the Company.\nThe Company has never paid any dividends to its common stockholders. The Company currently intends to retain any future earnings for funding growth and, therefore, does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. If the Company determines that it will pay cash dividends to the holders of its common stock, it cannot assure that such cash dividends will be paid on a timely basis. The success of your investment in the Company will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation. As a result, you will not receive any return on your investment prior to selling your shares in the Company and, for the other reasons discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, you may not receive any return on your investment even when you sell your shares in the Company.\nThe Company may require additional capital in the future to support its operations, and this capital has not always been readily available.\nThe Company may require additional debt or equity financing to fund its operations, including, but not limited to, working capital. The Company\u2019s limited operating history since its recent acquisition of Activ, which fundamentally changed its business, makes it difficult to evaluate the Company\u2019s current business model and future prospects. Accordingly, investors should consider the Company\u2019s prospects in light of the costs, uncertainties, delays and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in the early stages of development, as the Company has, in fact, encountered. Potential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties that a new company with a limited operating history and with limited funds, will face. In particular, while the Company does not have current plans to re-prioritize its business plan, potential investors should consider that there is a significant risk that the Company will not be able to:\n\u25cf implement or execute its current business plan, which may or may not be sound;\n\u25cf maintain its anticipated management and advisory team;\n\u25cf raise sufficient funds in the capital markets to effectuate the Company\u2019s business plan; and\n\u25cf identify, acquire or successfully integrate any acquisition candidate.\nIf the Company raises additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, the Company\u2019s existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities the Company issues could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of the Company\u2019s existing capital stock. Any debt financing secured by the Company in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to the Company\u2019s capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for the Company to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. In addition, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to it, if at all. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to it, when required, its ability to continue to support its current operations and to respond to business challenges would be significantly limited. If the Company cannot access the capital necessary to support the Company\u2019s business, the Company would be forced to curtail its business activities or even shut down operations. If the Company cannot execute any one of the foregoing or similar matters relating to the Company\u2019s business, the business may fail, in which case you would lose the entire amount of your investment in the Company.\nIf the Company fails to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act related to internal controls and procedures in the future, or, if the Company discovers material weaknesses and other deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting, the Company\u2019s stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting. If the Company fails to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act related to disclosure controls and procedures in the future, or, if the Company discovers material weaknesses and other deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting, the Company\u2019s stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult. If material weaknesses or significant deficiencies are discovered or if the Company otherwise fails to achieve and maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, the Company may not be able to ensure that it can conclude on an ongoing basis that it has effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for the Company to produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud. If the Company cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, its business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in the Company\u2019s reported financial information, and the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock could drop significantly.\nThe Company\u2019s Second Amended and Restated Bylaws designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of state law actions and proceedings that may be initiated by the Company\u2019s stockholders, which could limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with it or its directors, officers, employees or agents.\nThe Company\u2019s Second Amended and Restated Bylaws (\u201cBylaws\u201d) designates the Delaware Court of Chancery as the sole and exclusive forum for certain state law based actions including certain derivative actions or proceedings brought on behalf of the Company; an action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty owed by an officer, a director, employee or to the stockholders of the Company; any claim arising under Delaware corporate law; and any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThis exclusive forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or other federal securities laws for which there is exclusive federal or concurrent federal and state jurisdiction.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers, employees or agents and may result in increased costs to the Company\u2019s stockholders, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company and its directors, officers, employees and agents even though an action, if successful, might benefit the Company\u2019s stockholders. The Court of Chancery may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to the Company than to its stockholders. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of the Company\u2019s Bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, the Company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 18555, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "GHSI"}
