{"cik": "1674862", "company": "ASHLAND GLOBAL HOLDINGS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-11-21", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following discussion of \u201crisk factors\u201d identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect Ashland\u2019s business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K. The following discussion of risks is designed to highlight what Ashland believes are important factors to consider when evaluating its expectations. These factors could cause future results to differ from those in forward-looking statements and from historical trends.\nAshland has set aggressive growth goals for its businesses, including increasing sales, cash flow and margins, in order to achieve its long term strategic objectives. Ashland\u2019s successful execution of its growth strategies and business plans to facilitate that growth involves a number of risks.\nAshland has set aggressive growth goals for its businesses in order to meet long term strategic objectives and improve shareholder value. Ashland\u2019s failure to meet one or more of these goals or objectives would negatively impact Ashland\u2019s potential value and the businesses. One of the most important risks is that Ashland might fail to adequately execute its business and growth plans. Aspects of that risk include changes to global economic environment, changes to the competitive landscape, attraction and retention of skilled employees, the potential failure of product innovation plans, failure to comply with existing or new regulatory schemes, failure to maintain a competitive cost structure and other risks outlined in greater detail in this Item 1A.\nFailure to develop and market new products and production technologies could impact Ashland\u2019s competitive position and have an adverse effect on its businesses and results of operations.\nThe specialty chemical industry is subject to periodic technological change and ongoing product improvements. In order to maintain margins and remain competitive, Ashland must successfully develop and introduce new products or improvements that appeal to its customers and ultimately to global consumers. Ashland plans to grow earnings, in part, by focusing on developing markets and solutions to meet increasing demand in those markets, including demand for personal care and pharmaceutical products which are subject to lengthy regulatory approval processes. Ashland\u2019s efforts to respond to changes in consumer demand in a timely and cost-efficient manner to drive growth could be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, including the inability to identify viable new products, successfully complete research and development, obtain regulatory approvals, obtain intellectual property protection or gain market acceptance of new products. Due to the lengthy development process, technological challenges and intense competition, there can be no assurance that any of the products Ashland is currently developing, or could develop in the future, will achieve substantial commercial success.\nAshland faces competition from other companies, which places downward pressure on prices and margins and may adversely affect Ashland\u2019s businesses and results of operations.\nAshland operates in highly competitive markets, competing against a number of domestic and foreign companies. Competition is based on several key criteria, including product performance and quality, product price, product availability and security of supply, responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service, as well as the ability to bring innovative products or services to the marketplace. Certain key competitors are significantly larger than Ashland and have greater financial resources, leading to greater operating and financial flexibility. As a result, these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within the relevant industry, changes in the prices of raw materials and energy and changes in general economic conditions. In addition, competitors\u2019 pricing decisions could compel Ashland to decrease its prices, which could negatively affect its margins and profitability. Additional competition in markets served by Ashland could adversely affect margins and profitability and could lead to a reduction in market share. Also, Ashland competes in certain markets that are declining and has targeted other markets for growth opportunities. If Ashland\u2019s strategies for dealing with declining markets and leveraging opportunity markets are not successful, its businesses and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nAshland\u2019s success depends upon its ability to attract and retain key employees and the identification and development of talent to succeed senior management.\nAshland\u2019s success depends on its ability to attract and retain key personnel, and Ashland relies heavily on its management team. The inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect Ashland\u2019s operations. Also, a substantial portion of Ashland\u2019s U.S.-based employees will be retirement-eligible within the next five years. That, combined with the relatively small number of middle tier managers with substantial experience in place to replace this group of retirement eligible employees, increases the potential negative impact of the risk that key employees could leave the Company. This risk of unwanted employee turnover also is substantial in positions that require certain technical expertise and geographically in developing markets which Ashland has targeted for growth, especially in Asia, India, South America and Eastern Europe. In addition, because of its reliance on its management team, Ashland\u2019s future success depends, in part, on its ability to identify and develop talent to succeed its senior management and other key positions throughout the organization. If Ashland fails to identify and develop successors, the company is at risk of being harmed by the departures of these key employees.\nAshland\u2019s business exposes it to potential product liability claims and recalls, which could adversely affect its financial condition and performance.\nThe development, manufacture and sale of specialty chemical and other products by Ashland, including products produced for the food, beverage, personal care, pharmaceutical and nutritional supplement industries, involve an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims, product recalls, product seizures and related adverse publicity. A product liability claim or judgment against Ashland could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, affect consumer or customer confidence in its products, and divert management\u2019s attention from other responsibilities. Although Ashland maintains product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that this type or the level of coverage is adequate or that Ashland will be able to continue to maintain its existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all. A product recall or a partially or completely uninsured product liability judgment against Ashland could have a material adverse effect on its reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nAshland uses information technology (IT) systems to conduct business and these IT systems are at risk of potential disruption and cyber security threats.\nAshland\u2019s businesses rely on their IT systems to operate efficiently and in some cases, at all. Ashland employs third parties to maintain aspects of its IT systems and the functions of backing up and securing those systems. A partial or complete failure of Ashland\u2019s IT systems or those of our third parties managing, providing or servicing them for any amount of time more than several hours could result in significant business disruption causing harm to Ashland\u2019s reputation, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, the nature of our businesses, the markets we serve, and geographic profile of our operations make Ashland a target of cyber security threats. Despite steps Ashland takes to mitigate or eliminate them, cyber security threats to our systems are increasing and becoming more advanced and could occur as a result of the activity of hackers, employee error or employee misconduct. A breach of our IT systems could lead to the loss and destruction of trade secrets, confidential information, proprietary data, intellectual property, customer and supplier data, and employee personal information, and could disrupt business operations which could adversely affect Ashland\u2019s relationships with business partners and harm our brands, reputation, and financial results.\nAshland\u2019s substantial global operations subject it to risks of doing business in foreign countries, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nExcluding Valvoline, approximately 60% of Ashland\u2019s net sales for fiscal 2017 are expected to be to customers outside of North America. Ashland expects sales from international markets to continue to represent an even larger portion of the Company\u2019s sales in the future. Also, a significant portion of Ashland\u2019s manufacturing capacity is located outside of the United States. Accordingly, Ashland\u2019s business is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, cultural, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions.\nThe global nature of Ashland\u2019s business presents difficulties in hiring and maintaining a workforce in certain countries. Fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services provided in foreign countries. In addition, foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax Ashland\u2019s foreign income, or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls. The imposition of tariffs is also a risk that could impair Ashland\u2019s financial performance.\nCertain legal and political risks are also inherent in the operation of a company with Ashland\u2019s global scope. For example, if the United States withdraws from or engages in renegotiation of trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership or more aggressively prosecutes trade disputes with countries like China, Ashland\u2019s ability to do business and execute its growth strategies could be adversely affected. In addition, it may be more difficult for Ashland to enforce its agreements or collect receivables through foreign legal systems. There is a risk that foreign governments may nationalize private enterprises in certain countries where Ashland operates. In certain countries or regions, terrorist activities and\nthe response to such activities may threaten Ashland\u2019s operations more than in those in the United States. In Europe, the effect of economic sanctions imposed on Russia and/or Russia\u2019s reaction to the sanctions could adversely impact Ashland\u2019s performance and results of operations. Social and cultural norms in certain countries may not support compliance with Ashland\u2019s corporate policies including those that require compliance with substantive laws and regulations. Also, changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where Ashland operates, particularly in Europe, the Middle East and emerging markets, are a risk to Ashland\u2019s financial performance.\nAs Ashland continues to operate its business globally, its success will depend, in part, on its ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. There can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to its multinational operations will not have an adverse effect on Ashland\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nBusiness disruptions from natural, operational and other catastrophic risks could seriously harm Ashland\u2019s operations and financial performance. In addition, a catastrophic event at one of Ashland\u2019s facilities or involving its products or employees could lead to liabilities that could further impair its operations and financial performance.\nBusiness disruptions, including those related to operating hazards inherent with the production of chemicals, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, supply or logistics disruptions, increasing costs for energy, temporary plant and/or power outages, information technology systems and network disruptions, cyber-security breach, terrorist attacks, armed conflict, war, pandemic diseases, fires, floods or other catastrophic events, could seriously harm Ashland\u2019s operations, as well as the operations of its customers and suppliers, and may adversely impact Ashland\u2019s financial performance. Although it is impossible to predict the occurrence or consequences of any such events, they could result in reduced demand for Ashland\u2019s products, make it difficult or impossible for Ashland to manufacture its products or deliver products and services to its customers or to receive raw materials from suppliers, or create delays and inefficiencies in the supply chain. In addition to leading to a serious disruption of Ashland\u2019s businesses, a catastrophic event at one of our facilities or involving our products or employees could lead to substantial legal liability to or claims by parties allegedly harmed by the event.\nWhile Ashland maintains business continuity plans that are intended to allow it to continue operations or mitigate the effects of events that could disrupt its business, Ashland cannot provide assurances that its plans would fully protect it from all such events. In addition, insurance maintained by Ashland to protect against property damage, loss of business and other related consequences resulting from catastrophic events is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of Ashland\u2019s damages or damages to others in the event of a catastrophe. In addition, insurance related to these types of risks may not be available now or, if available, may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable rates.\nThe impact of changing laws or regulations or the manner of interpretation or enforcement of existing rules could adversely impact Ashland\u2019s financial performance and restrict its ability to operate its business or execute its strategies.\nNew laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase Ashland\u2019s cost of doing business and restrict its ability to operate its business or execute its strategies. This includes, among other things, the possible taxation under U.S. law of certain income from foreign operations, the possible taxation under foreign laws of certain income Ashland reports in other jurisdictions, regulations related to the protection of private information of Ashland\u2019s employees and customers, regulations issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (and analogous non-U.S. agencies) affecting Ashland and its customers, compliance with The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (and analogous non-U.S. laws) and the European Union\u2019s Registration, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation (and analogous non-EU initiatives), and costs associated with complying with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and the regulations promulgated thereunder. In addition, compliance with laws and regulations is complicated by Ashland\u2019s substantial and growing global footprint, which will require significant and additional resources to comprehend and ensure compliance with applicable laws in the more than one hundred countries where Ashland conducts business.\nThe competitive nature of Ashland\u2019s markets may delay or prevent the Company from passing increases in raw materials or energy costs on to its customers. In addition, certain of Ashland\u2019s suppliers may be unable to deliver products or raw materials or may withdraw from contractual arrangements. The occurrence of either event could adversely affect Ashland\u2019s results of operations.\nRising and volatile raw material prices, especially those of hydrocarbon derivatives, cotton linters or wood pulp, may negatively impact Ashland\u2019s costs, results of operations and the valuation of its inventory. Similarly, energy costs are a significant component of certain of Ashland\u2019s product costs. Ashland is not always able to raise prices in response to such increased costs, and its ability to pass on the costs of such price increases is dependent upon market conditions. Likewise, reductions in the valuation of Ashland\u2019s inventory due to market volatility may not be recovered and could result in losses.\nAshland purchases certain products and raw materials from suppliers, often pursuant to written supply contracts. If those suppliers are unable to meet Ashland\u2019s orders in a timely manner or choose to terminate or otherwise avoid contractual arrangements,\nAshland may not be able to make alternative supply arrangements. Also, domestic and global government regulations related to the manufacture or transport of certain raw materials may impede Ashland\u2019s ability to obtain those raw materials on commercially reasonable terms. If Ashland is unable to obtain and retain qualified suppliers under commercially acceptable terms, its ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely, competitive and profitable manner or grow its business successfully could be adversely affected.\nImposition of new taxes, disagreements with tax authorities or additional tax liabilities could adversely affect Ashland\u2019s business, financial condition, reputation or results of operations.\nAshland\u2019s products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold in more than 100 countries and territories. As such, Ashland is subject to myriad tax laws and regulations applicable in those countries and territories, as well as those of the United States and its various state and local governments. Economic and political pressure to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions where Ashland operates or does business, or the adoption of new or reformed tax regulations, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult, and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation may differ from our historical provisions and accruals resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, reputation or results of operations.\nAshland\u2019s operations outside the United States generate a significant portion of its net revenues, and repatriation of foreign earnings to the United States could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition to tax reform strategies being considered in the United States, many other countries, including countries in which Ashland has significant operations, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws. Changes in how United States multinational corporations are taxed on earnings could adversely affect Ashland\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nValvoline is now a publicly traded company with separate risks disclosed in filings with the SEC. Ashland\u2019s plan to completely separate from Valvoline is subject to various risks and uncertainties and may not be completed in accordance with the expected plans or anticipated timeline, or at all, and will continue to involve significant time and expense, any of which could negatively impact our businesses.\nOn September 22, 2015, Ashland announced plans to separate its Valvoline business from its specialty chemicals businesses in a structure that is expected to be tax free for Ashland shareholders. On April 13, 2016, Ashland announced that it would pursue an initial public offering of up to 20 percent of the common stock of Valvoline as a first step in the separation. On September 22, 2016, Ashland and Valvoline Inc. announced the pricing of the IPO of Valvoline Inc.\u2019s common stock at a price to the public of $22.00 per share. The IPO closed on September 28, 2016, resulting in approximately 17% of Valvoline\u2019s stock being publicly traded. The offering of shares of Valvoline was made by a prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Valvoline Inc. on September 19, 2016 and the risks associated with investing in Valvoline are described in that amended form S-1 prospectus and in subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission made by Valvoline Inc.\nAshland presently intends to distribute the remaining Valvoline Inc. shares in 2017 following the release of March-quarter earnings results by both Ashland and Valvoline Inc. The final distribution is subject to final approval from Ashland\u2019s board of directors. In addition, other unanticipated developments, including changes to the competitive environment for Valvoline\u2019s or Ashland\u2019s respective businesses, possible delays in obtaining or failure to obtain tax opinions, regulatory or other approvals or clearances to approve or facilitate the separation, uncertainty in financial markets and other challenges in executing the separation as planned, could delay or prevent the final distribution, or cause the final distribution to occur on terms or conditions that are different or less favorable than expected.\nAshland expects that the process of completing the final distribution will continue to be time-consuming and may involve significant costs and expenses, which may be significantly higher than those currently anticipated and may not yield a discernible benefit if the final distribution is not completed. Also, the time and energy required from Ashland\u2019s senior management and other employees to plan and execute the final distribution may lead to increased costs, increased expenses, negative effects on relationships with business partners, suppliers, and customers, disruptions in operations and ultimately harm its businesses. Ashland may also experience difficulty attracting, retaining and motivating employees during the pendency of the final distribution, which could also harm its businesses.\nIf the final distribution is completed, there is a further risk that the sum of the value of the two independent, publicly traded companies will be less than the value of Ashland before the final distribution. There is also a risk that the completed final distribution will not meet all of the intended financial, strategic, and operational benefits that were the impetus for the decision to separate the companies.\nThe final distribution could result in significant tax liability to Ashland and its stockholders.\nAshland expects to obtain a written opinion of counsel to the effect that the final distribution should qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). The opinion of counsel would not address any U.S. state or local or foreign tax consequences of the final distribution. The opinion will assume that the final distribution will be completed according to the terms of the separation agreement and will rely on the facts as described in the\nseparation agreement, the tax matters agreement, other ancillary agreements, the information statement to be distributed to Ashland\u2019s stockholders in connection with the final distribution and a number of other documents. In addition, the opinion will be based on certain representations as to factual matters from, and certain covenants by, Ashland and Valvoline. The opinion cannot be relied on if any of the assumptions, representations or covenants is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate or is violated in any material respect. The opinion will be based on current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect.\nThe opinion of counsel will not be binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position. Ashland has not requested, and does not intend to request, a ruling from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the final distribution.\nIf the final distribution were determined not to qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss, Ashland stockholders could be subject to tax. In this case, each Ashland stockholder who receives Valvoline common stock in the final distribution would generally be treated as receiving a distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the Valvoline common stock received, which would generally result in (i) a taxable dividend to the Ashland stockholder to the extent of that Ashland stockholder\u2019s pro rata share of Ashland\u2019s current and accumulated earnings and profits; (ii) a reduction in the Ashland stockholder\u2019s basis (but not below zero) in Ashland common stock to the extent the amount received exceeds the stockholder\u2019s share of Ashland\u2019s earnings and profits; and (iii) a taxable gain from the exchange of Ashland common stock to the extent the amount received exceeds the sum of the Ashland stockholder\u2019s share of Ashland\u2019s earnings and profits and the Ashland stockholder\u2019s basis in its Ashland common stock.\nIf the final distribution were determined not to qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss, then Ashland would recognize gain in an amount up to the fair market value of the Valvoline common stock it distributed in the final distribution. In addition, certain internal transactions undertaken in connection with the Reorganization could be determined to be taxable, which could result in additional taxable gain.\nThe IPO and certain internal transactions undertaken in connection with the Reorganization could give rise to material tax liabilities to Ashland.\nAshland expects that the IPO and certain internal transactions undertaken to effectuate the Reorganization should be nontaxable transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes and has obtained written opinions of counsel to that effect. The opinions are based on certain assumptions and representations as to factual matters from Ashland and Valvoline Inc., as well as certain covenants by those parties. The opinions cannot be relied upon if any of the assumptions, representations or covenants is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate or is violated in any material respect. The opinions of counsel are not binding upon the IRS or the courts, and there is no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position. It is possible that the IRS or a state or local taxing authority could take the position that those internal transactions or the receipt of proceeds of the IPO result in the recognition of significant taxable gain by Ashland, in which case Ashland may be subject to material tax liabilities.\nThe U.S. federal income tax rules applicable to a tax-free final distribution may restrict Ashland from engaging in certain corporate transactions or from raising equity capital beyond certain thresholds for a period of time after the final distribution.\nSection 355(e) of the Code generally creates a presumption that the final distribution would be taxable to Ashland, but not to its stockholders, if Ashland or Valvoline or their respective stockholders were to engage in transactions that result in a 50% or greater change (by vote or value) in the ownership of the respective common stock of Ashland or Valvoline during the four-year period beginning on the date that begins two years before the date of the final distribution, unless it were established that such transactions and the final distribution were not part of a plan or series of related transactions. If the final distribution were taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes to Ashland due to a 50% or greater change in the ownership of Ashland\u2019s or Valvoline\u2019s common stock, Ashland would recognize gain as if it had sold Valvoline common stock in a taxable transaction in an amount up to the fair market value of the Valvoline common stock held by Ashland immediately before the final distribution. The tax liability resulting from such gain could have a material impact on Ashland\u2019s operations\nAn acquisition that occurs during the four-year period beginning on the date that begins two years before the date of the final distribution is presumed to occur pursuant to a plan or series of related transactions, unless it is established that the acquisition is not pursuant to a plan or series of transactions that includes the final distribution. U.S. Treasury regulations currently in effect generally provide that whether an acquisition and a tax-free distribution of common stock are part of a plan is determined based on all of the facts and circumstances, including, but not limited to, specific factors described in the U.S. Treasury regulations. In addition, the U.S. Treasury regulations also provide several \u201csafe harbors\u201d for acquisitions that are not considered to be part of a plan.\nIn addition, the final distribution would not qualify for non-recognition of gain or loss to Ashland and its stockholders if it were determined to be a \u201cdevice\u201d for the distribution of earnings and profits. An acquisition of Ashland\u2019s or Valvoline\u2019s common stock might be considered to be evidence that the final distribution was a \u201cdevice\u201d unless Ashland and Valvoline could demonstrate, based on all of the facts and circumstances, that they did not plan or anticipate such an acquisition or certain other exceptions\napplied. The tax liability to Ashland that would result from a determination that the final distribution is a \u201cdevice\u201d could have a material impact on Ashland\u2019s operations.\nThe potential tax liability to Ashland described above may limit Ashland\u2019s ability to pursue strategic transactions of a certain magnitude that involve the issuance or acquisition of Ashland common stock. This restriction may also limit Ashland\u2019s ability to raise significant amounts of cash through the issuance of common stock, especially if Ashland\u2019s stock price were to suffer substantial declines.\nAdverse developments in the global economy and potential disruptions of financial markets could negatively impact Ashland\u2019s customers and suppliers, and therefore have a negative impact on Ashland\u2019s results of operations.\nA global or regional economic downturn may reduce customer demand or inhibit Ashland\u2019s ability to produce and sell products. Ashland\u2019s business and operating results are sensitive to global and regional economic downturns, credit market tightness, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices, volatile exchange rates, changes in interest rates, sovereign debt defaults and other challenges, including those related to international sanctions and acts of aggression or threatened aggression that can affect the global economy. In the event of adverse developments or stagnation in the economy or financial markets, Ashland\u2019s customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, reduced demand for their products, cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing. As a result, existing or potential customers might delay or cancel plans to purchase products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to Ashland in a timely fashion. Further, suppliers may experience similar conditions, which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to Ashland. A weakening or reversal of the current economic recovery in the global economy or a substantial part of it could negatively impact Ashland\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to grow.\nAshland may not be able to effectively protect or enforce its intellectual property rights.\nAshland relies on the patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws of the United States and other countries to protect its intellectual property rights. The laws of some countries may not protect Ashland\u2019s intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Failure of foreign countries to have laws to protect Ashland\u2019s intellectual property rights or an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign countries could result in the loss of valuable proprietary information, which could have an adverse effect on Ashland\u2019s business and results of operations.\nEven in circumstances where Ashland has a patent on certain technologies, such patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competing technologies. In addition, any patent applications submitted by Ashland may not result in an issued patent. There can be no assurance that Ashland\u2019s intellectual property rights will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. Ashland could also face claims from third parties alleging that Ashland\u2019s products or processes infringe on their proprietary rights. If Ashland is found liable for infringement, it could be responsible for significant damages, prohibited from using certain products or processes or required to modify certain products and processes. Any such infringement liability could adversely affect Ashland\u2019s product and service offerings, profitability and results of operations.\nAshland also has substantial intellectual property associated with its know-how and trade secrets that are not protected by patent or copyright laws. Ashland protects these rights by entering into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with most of its employees and with third parties. There can be no assurance that such agreements will not be breached or that Ashland will be able to effectively enforce them. In addition, Ashland\u2019s trade secrets and know-how may be improperly obtained by other means, such as a breach of Ashland\u2019s information technologies security systems or direct theft. Any unauthorized disclosure of any of Ashland\u2019s material know-how or trade secrets could adversely affect Ashland\u2019s business and results of operations.\nAshland has incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial costs as a result of environmental, health and safety, and hazardous substances liabilities and related compliance requirements. These costs could adversely impact Ashland\u2019s cash flow, and, to the extent they exceed Ashland\u2019s established reserves for these liabilities, its results of operations.\nAshland is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to pollution, protection of the environment and human health and safety, and the generation, storage, handling, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials. Ashland has incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs and capital expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations.\nEnvironmental, health and safety regulations change frequently, and such regulations and their enforcement have tended to become more stringent over time. Accordingly, changes in environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and the enforcement of such laws and regulations could interrupt Ashland\u2019s operations, require modifications to its facilities or cause Ashland to incur significant liabilities, costs or losses that could adversely affect its profitability. Actual or alleged violations of environmental, health or safety laws and regulations could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations as well as substantial damages, penalties, fines, civil or criminal sanctions and remediation costs. In addition, under some environmental laws, Ashland may be strictly liable and/or jointly and severally liable for environmental damages and penalties.\nAshland is also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that require environmental assessment or remediation efforts (collectively, environmental remediation) at multiple locations. Ashland uses engineering studies, historical experience and other factors to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated reserves for environmental remediation. Environmental remediation reserves are subject to numerous inherent uncertainties that affect Ashland\u2019s ability to estimate its share of the applicable costs. Such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site, the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations, widely varying costs of alternate cleanup methods, changes in environmental regulations, the potential effect of continuing improvements in remediation technology and the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at multiparty sites. As a result, Ashland\u2019s actual costs for environmental remediation could affect Ashland\u2019s cash flow and, to the extent costs exceed established reserves for those liabilities, its results of operations.\nAshland is responsible for, and has financial exposure to, liabilities from pending and threatened claims, including those alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos, which could adversely impact Ashland\u2019s results of operations and cash flow.\nThere are various claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings pending or threatened, including those alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos, against Ashland and its current and former subsidiaries. Such actions are with respect to commercial matters, product liability, toxic tort liability and other matters that seek remedies or damages, some of which are for substantial amounts. While these actions are being contested, their outcome is not predictable. Ashland\u2019s results could be adversely affected by financial exposure to these liabilities. Insurance maintained by Ashland to protect against claims for damages alleged by third parties is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of Ashland\u2019s liabilities to others. In addition, insurance related to these types of risks may not be available now or, if available, may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable rates. Ashland\u2019s ability to recover from its insurers for asbestos liabilities could also have an adverse impact on its results of operations. Projecting future asbestos costs is subject to numerous variables that are extremely difficult to predict. In addition to the significant uncertainties surrounding the number of claims that might be received, other variables include the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant, the long latency period associated with asbestos exposure, dismissal rates, costs of medical treatment, the impact of bankruptcies of other companies that are co-defendants in claims, uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case, and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards. Furthermore, any predictions with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens. In light of these inherent uncertainties, Ashland believes that its asbestos reserves represent the best estimate within a range of possible outcomes. As a part of the process to develop these estimates of future asbestos costs, a range of long-term cost models was developed. These models are based on national studies that predict the number of people likely to develop asbestos-related diseases and are heavily influenced by assumptions regarding long-term inflation rates for indemnity payments and legal defense costs, as well as other variables mentioned previously. Because of the inherent uncertainties in projecting future asbestos liabilities and establishing appropriate reserves, Ashland\u2019s actual asbestos costs could adversely affect its results of operations and, to the extent they exceed its reserves, could adversely affect its results of operations.\nAshland\u2019s substantial indebtedness may adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAshland maintains a substantial amount of debt. Ashland\u2019s substantial indebtedness could adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition by, among other things:\n\u2022\nrequiring Ashland to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on its debt, which would reduce the availability of Ashland\u2019s cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, execution of its growth strategy and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting Ashland\u2019s ability to borrow additional amounts to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of its growth strategy and other purposes;\n\u2022\nmaking Ashland more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and regulatory conditions and in its business by limiting Ashland\u2019s flexibility in planning for, and making it more difficult for Ashland to react quickly to, changing conditions;\n\u2022\nplacing Ashland at a competitive disadvantage compared with those of its competitors that have less debt and lower debt service requirements;\n\u2022\nmaking Ashland more vulnerable to increases in interest rates since some of its indebtedness is subject to variable rates of interest; and\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for Ashland to satisfy its financial obligations.\nIn addition, Ashland may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from its operations to repay its indebtedness when it becomes due and to meet its other cash needs. If Ashland is not able to pay its debts as they become due, it could be in default under its credit facility or other indebtedness. Ashland might also be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies to repay indebtedness, such as selling assets, refinancing or restructuring its indebtedness or selling additional debt or equity securities. Ashland may not be able to refinance its debt or sell additional debt or equity securities or its assets on favorable terms, if at all, and if Ashland must sell its assets, it may negatively affect its ability to generate revenues.", "PERMNO": 24272, "SIC": 2820, "TIC": "ASH"}
