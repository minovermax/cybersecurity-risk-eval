{"cik": "860413", "company": "FIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nLike other financial and bank holding companies, we are subject to a number of risks, many of which are outside of our control. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be harmed. These risks are not the only ones that we may face. Other risks of which we are not aware, including those which relate to the banking and financial services industry in general and us in particular, or those which we do not currently believe are material, may harm our future business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Readers should consider carefully the following important factors in evaluating us, our business and an investment in our securities.\nRisks Relating to the Market and Our Business\nA worsening of economic conditions could reduce demand for our products and services and/or result in increases in our level of non-performing loans, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur customers are located predominantly in Montana, Wyoming and South Dakota. Our profitability depends primarily on the general economic conditions in these areas. Local economic conditions have a significant impact on our commercial real estate and construction and consumer loans, the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans.\nDeterioration in economic conditions could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations:\n\u2022\ndemand for our products and services may decline;\n\u2022\nloan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022\ncollateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, in turn reducing customers\u2019 future borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans;\n\u2022\nthe value of our securities portfolio may decline; and\n\u2022\nthe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us.\nMoreover, a significant decline in general economic conditions, caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, an outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities, unemployment or other factors beyond our control could further impact these local economic conditions and could further negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of underlying collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nWe are subject to lending risks.\nWe take on credit risk by virtue of making loans and extending loan commitments and letters of credit. Our credit standards, procedures and policies may not prevent us from incurring substantial credit losses, particularly in light of market developments. Our lending is affected by increases in interest rates and/or weakening economic conditions, each of which could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or impact the value of the collateral securing these loans, resulting in higher delinquencies, repossessions and losses, which would have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We are also subject to various laws and regulations that affect our lending activities. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to regulatory enforcement action.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $2.6 billion of commercial loans, including $1.8 billion of commercial real estate loans, representing approximately 48% of our total loan portfolio. These loans may involve greater risks than other types of lending. Because payments on such loans are often dependent on the successful operation or development of the property or business involved, repayment of such loans is more sensitive than other types of loans to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the general economy. Commercial loans typically are made on the basis of the borrowers' ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the commercial venture. If the cash flow from business operations is reduced, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Due to the larger average size of each commercial loan as compared with other loans, as well as the collateral that is generally less readily-marketable, losses incurred on commercial loans could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, at December 31, 2016, we had $1.7 billion of agricultural, construction, residential and other real estate loans, representing approximately 31% of our total loan portfolio. Deterioration in economic conditions or in the real estate market could result in increased delinquencies and foreclosures and could have an adverse effect on the collateral value for many of these loans and on the repayment ability of many of our borrowers. Deterioration in economic conditions or in the real estate market could also reduce the number of loans we make to businesses in the construction and real estate industry, which could negatively impact our interest income and results of operations. Similarly, the occurrence of a natural or manmade disaster in our market areas could impair the value of the collateral we hold for real estate secured loans. Any one or a combination of the factors identified above could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nChanges in interest rates could negatively impact our net interest income, may weaken demand for our products and services or harm our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon net interest income, which is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also adversely affect (1) our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (2) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, including mortgage servicing rights, (3) our ability to realize gains on the sale of assets and (4) the average duration of our mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations portfolios. An increase in interest rates may reduce customers' desire to borrow money from us as it increases their borrowing costs and may adversely affect the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans, which may lead to an increase in non-performing assets and a reduction of income recognized. Any substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we experience loan losses in excess of estimated amounts, our earnings will be adversely affected.\nThe risk of credit losses on loans varies with, among other things, general economic conditions, the composition of our loan portfolio, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and, in the case of a collateralized loan, the value and marketability of the collateral for the loan. We maintain an allowance for loan losses based upon, among other things, historical experience, an evaluation of economic conditions and regular reviews of loan portfolio quality. Based upon such factors, our management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectability of our loan portfolio and provides an allowance for loan losses. These assumptions and judgments are complex and difficult to determine given the significant uncertainty surrounding future conditions in the general economy and banking industry. If management's assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect and the allowance for loan losses is inadequate, or if the banking authorities or regulations require us to increase the allowance for loan losses, our earnings, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be significantly and adversely affected.\nWe may be adversely affected by declining oil and gas prices, and declining demand for coal.\nOil and gas drilling and production in Wyoming and in the Bakken Formation in Montana and North Dakota have been important contributors to our region's economic growth over the years. As of December 31, 2016, our direct exposure to the oil and gas industry was approximately $59 million in outstanding loans, including approximately $43 million related to drilling and extraction activity and approximately $16 million advanced to oil and gas service companies. As of December 31, 2016, we also had commitments to lend an additional $25 million to oil and gas borrowers. These borrowers may be significantly affected by volatility in oil and gas prices and declines in the level of drilling and production activity. A prolonged period of low oil and gas prices or other events that result in a decline in drilling activity could have a negative impact on the economies of our market areas and on our customers. We carefully monitor the impact of volatility in oil and gas prices on our loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2016, 76.3% of our outstanding oil and gas loans were criticized.\nAdditionally, adverse developments in the demand for coal due to tightening environmental regulations, the suspension of new coal leasing on federal lands, slower growth in electricity demand and fuel competition from low natural gas prices, may impact the economies of the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming.\nAdverse developments in the energy sector could have spillover effects on the broader economies of our market areas, including commercial and residential real estate values and the general level of economic activity. The State of Wyoming derives a significant portion of its operating budget from energy extraction and related industries. As such, reductions in oil, gas and coal related revenues may have additional negative economic implications for the State of Wyoming. There is no assurance that our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will not be adversely impacted by increases in non-performing oil and gas loans, or by the direct and indirect effects of current and future conditions in the energy industry.\nWe will become subject to additional regulatory requirements if our total assets exceed $10 billion, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nVarious federal banking laws and regulations, including rules adopted by the Federal Reserve pursuant to the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, impose heightened requirements on certain large banks and bank holding companies. Most of these rules apply primarily to bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, but certain rules also apply to banks and bank holding companies with at least $10 billion in total consolidated assets.\nFollowing the fourth consecutive quarter (and any applicable phase-in period) where our or the Bank\u2019s total consolidated assets equal or exceed $10 billion, we or the Bank, as applicable, will be subject to the following Dodd-Frank Act provisions, among others:\n\u2022\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, which has broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks, including the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices. Currently, the Federal Reserve Board and the Montana Division examine the Bank for compliance with consumer protection laws. However, the CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets, and accordingly will assume examination and enforcement authority over us should we exceed $10 billion in total assets.\n\u2022\nThe Dodd-Frank Act has limited the interchange fees for electronic debt transactions by a payment card issuer to $0.21 plus five basis points times the value of the transaction, plus up to $0.01 for fraud prevention costs. Should we exceed $10 billion in total assets, our interchange revenue will be significantly lower.\n\u2022\nThe Dodd-Frank Act established 1.35% as the minimum DIF reserve ratio and has adopted a plan under which it will meet the statutory minimum fund reserve ratio of 1.35% by September 30, 2020. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to offset the effect of the increase in the statutory minimum fund reserve ratio to 1.35% from the former statutory minimum of 1.15% on institutions with assets less than $10 billion. Should we exceed $10 billion in total assets, we will not be entitled to benefit from the offset.\n\u2022\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires a publicly traded bank holding company with $10 billion or more in assets to establish and maintain a risk committee responsible for oversight of enterprise-wide risk management practices, which must be commensurate with the bank\u2019s structure, risk profile, complexity, activities and size.\n\u2022\nA bank holding company with more than $10 billion in assets is required under the Dodd-Frank Act to conduct annual stress tests to determine whether the capital planning of the combined company, assessment of its capital adequacy and risk management practices adequately protect it and its affiliates in the event of an economic downturn. The results of the annual stress tests are reported to the Federal Reserve Board, and it will be required to consider the results of the company\u2019s stress tests as part of its capital planning and risk management practices.\nWhile we do not currently have $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets, if our announced acquisition of Cascade Bancorp is completed as expected, our total consolidated assets will exceed $10 billion during the third quarter of 2017. Assuming the merger is consummated, we anticipated we will become subject to the Dodd-Frank Act stress testing requirements commencing on January 1, 2019.\nIt is difficult to predict the overall cost of complying with the Dodd-Frank Act. Compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act requirements may necessitate that we hire additional compliance or other personnel, design and implement additional internal controls, engage external consultants or incur other significant expenses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Compliance with the annual stress testing requirements, part of which must be publicly disclosed, may be misinterpreted by the market generally or our customers and, as a result, may adversely affect our stock price or our ability to retain our customers or effectively compete for new business opportunities.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate or profitably operate acquired organizations, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nAcquisitions of other banks and financial institutions involves the integration of two companies that have previously operated independently. The difficulties of combining the operations of the two companies include, among other things: integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds; combining different corporate cultures; and retaining key employees. The process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of the business and the loss of key personnel. The integration of the two companies may require the experience and expertise of certain key employees of the target company that we expect to retain. We may not be successful in retaining these employees for the time period necessary to successfully integrate the acquired company\u2019s operations with ours. The diversion of management\u2019s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the merger and the integration of the two companies\u2019 operations could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations following the merger.\nAdditionally, we may not be able to successfully achieve the level of cost savings, revenue enhancements, and other synergies that we expect, and may not be able to capitalize upon the existing customer relationships of the acquired company to the extent anticipated, or it may take longer, or be more difficult or expensive than expected, to achieve these goals. This could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operation and stock price.\nWe may not continue to have access to low-cost funding sources.\nWe depend on checking and savings, negotiable order of withdrawal, or NOW, and money market deposit account balances and other forms of customer deposits as our primary source of funding. Such account and deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a better risk/return trade-off. Additionally, the availability of internet banking products has increased the mobility of customer deposits. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments or internet banking products, we could lose a relatively low cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and net income.\nOur goodwill may become impaired, which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition and may limit our Bank's ability to pay dividends to us, thereby causing liquidity issues.\nThe excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets from acquisitions, or goodwill, is evaluated for impairment at least annually and on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is likely impairment has occurred. In testing for impairment, the fair value of net assets is estimated based on analyses of our market value, discounted cash flows and peer values. Consequently, the determination of the fair value of goodwill is sensitive to market-based economics and other key assumptions. Variability in market conditions or in key assumptions could result in impairment of goodwill, which is recorded as a non-cash adjustment to income. An impairment of goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2016, we had goodwill of $213 million, or 22% of our total stockholders' equity. Further, the acquisition of Cascade Bancorp may significantly increase the amount of our goodwill, which could increase impairment losses.\nChanges in accounting standards could materially impact our financial statements.\nFrom time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. The FASB proposed amendments to its guidance on the credit impairment of financial instruments. The proposed amendments, which will be effective for our first fiscal year after December 15, 2019, would introduce a new impairment model based on current expected credit losses, or CECL rather than incurred losses. The CECL model would apply to most debt instruments, including loan receivables and loan commitments.\nUnlike the incurred loss models in existing generally accepted accounting principles, the CECL model does not specify a threshold for the recognition of an impairment allowance. Rather, we would recognize an impairment allowance equal to our current estimate of expected credit losses for financial instruments as of the end of the reporting period. This will change the current method of providing allowances for credit losses that are probable, which may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, and may greatly increase the types of data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses.\nWe are dependent upon the services of our management team and directors.\nOur future success and profitability is substantially dependent upon the management skills of our executive officers and directors, many of whom have held officer and director positions with us for many years. We do not currently have employment agreements or non-competition agreements with any of our key executives, other than an employment agreement with our president and chief executive officer, Kevin P. Riley. The unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees could harm our ability to operate our business or execute our business strategy. We may not be successful in retaining these key employees or finding and integrating suitable successors in the event of their loss or unavailability.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees to operate our business effectively.\nAs a result of low unemployment rates in Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota and the surrounding region, there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in our markets. It may be difficult for us to attract and retain qualified employees at all management and staffing levels. Failure to attract and retain employees and maintain adequate staffing of qualified personnel could adversely impact our operations and our ability to execute our business strategy. Furthermore, relatively low unemployment rates in certain of our markets may lead to significant increases in salaries, wages and employee benefits expenses as we compete for qualified, skilled employees, which could negatively impact our results of operations and prospects.\nWe are subject to significant governmental regulation and new or changes in existing regulatory, tax and accounting rules and interpretations could significantly harm our business.\nThe financial services industry is extensively regulated. Federal and state banking regulations are designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers, not to benefit a financial company's stockholders. These regulations may impose significant limitations on operations. The significant federal and state banking regulations that affect us are described in this report under the heading \u201cRegulation and Supervision.\u201d These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance, employment, monetary and other laws and regulations, rules, standards, policies and interpretations control the methods by which we conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance and govern financial reporting and disclosures. These laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies and interpretations are undergoing significant review and changes, particularly given the recent market developments in the banking and financial services industries and the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act in July 2010.\nOther changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or supervisory guidance, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, policies, or supervisory guidance, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by Federal or state authorities. In this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, often pursue aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have become subject to more stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity, or constrain us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares.\nIn July 2013, the FDIC and the federal banking agencies approved a new rule that substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to us. The final rule implements the \u201cBasel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe final rule included new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective for us on January 1, 2015, and refined the definition of what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements are: (1) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (2) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (3) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from prior rules); and (4) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The final rule also required unrealized gains and losses on certain \u201cavailable-for-sale\u201d securities holdings to be included for calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one-time opt-out is exercised. The final rule also established a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5%, that, when fully phased in, will result in the following minimum ratios: (1) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (2) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%, and (3) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. Phase in of the new capital conservation buffer requirement began in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions constraining us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements.\nThe FDIC has adopted a plan to increase the federal DIF, including additional future premium increases and special assessments.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments and assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity capital of a financial institution. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act established 1.35% as the minimum DIF reserve ratio and has adopted a plan under which it will meet the statutory minimum fund reserve ratio of 1.35% by September 30, 2020. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to offset the effect on institutions with assets less than $10 billion of the increase in the statutory minimum fund reserve ratio to 1.35% from the former statutory minimum of 1.15%. As a result, the deposit insurance assessments to be paid by the Bank could increase. Any additional future premium increases or special assessments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFinal CFPB regulations could restrict our ability to originate and sell mortgage loans.\nThe CFPB has issued a rule designed to clarify for lenders how they can avoid monetary damages under the Dodd-Frank Act, which would hold lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a mortgage. Loans that meet this \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d definition will be presumed to have complied with the new ability-to-repay standard. Under the CFPB\u2019s rule, a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d loan must not contain certain specified features, including:\n\u2022\nexcessive upfront points and fees (those exceeding 3% of the total loan amount, less \u201cbona fide discount points\u201d for prime loans);\n\u2022\ninterest-only payments;\n\u2022\nnegative-amortization; and\n\u2022\nterms longer than 30 years.\nAlso, to qualify as a \u201cqualified mortgage,\u201d a borrower\u2019s total debt-to-income ratio may not exceed 43%. Lenders must also verify and document the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify the borrower for the loan and underwrite the loan based on a fully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years, taking into account all applicable taxes, insurance and assessments. The CFPB\u2019s rule on qualified mortgages could limit our ability or desire to make certain types of loans or loans to certain borrowers, or could make it more expensive/and or time consuming to make these loans, which could limit our growth or profitability.\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers, and systems failures or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers. We outsource many of our major systems, such as certain data processing, loan servicing and deposit processing systems. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience disruptions if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or disruption could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nWe are exposed to risks related to cyber-security.\nOur computer systems and network infrastructure could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities or identity theft. Financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses, malware, cyber-attacks and other means.\nIn addition, we provide our customers with the ability to bank remotely, including online, through their mobile device and over the telephone. The secure transmission of confidential information over the internet and other remote channels is a critical element of remote banking. Our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other internal and external security breaches. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. To the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and other possible liabilities.\nDespite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, cyber threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks, nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile payment and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications.\nFurther, targeted social engineering attacks may be sophisticated and difficult to prevent and our employees, customers or other users of our systems may be fraudulently induced to disclose sensitive information, allowing cyber criminals to gain access to our data or data of our customers.\nA successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us serious negative consequences, including significant disruption of operations, misappropriation of confidential information, or damage to our computers or systems or those of our customers and counterparties. A successful security breach could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, significant litigation exposure, and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe resolution of litigation, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular period.\nWe face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remains high. Legal liability against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause harm to our reputation, which in turn could adversely impact our business prospects.\nAdditionally, some of the services we provide, such as trust and investment services, require us to act as fiduciaries for our customers and others. From time to time, third parties make claims and take legal action against us pertaining to the performance of our fiduciary responsibilities. If these claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us, we may be exposed to significant financial liability and/or our reputation could be damaged. Either of these results may adversely impact demand for our products and services or otherwise have a harmful effect on our business and, in turn, on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe are subject to liquidity risks.\nLiquidity is the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. Our liquidity is used to make loans and to repay deposit liabilities as they become due or are demanded by customers. Potential alternative sources of liquidity include federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements. We maintain a portfolio of investment securities and hold overnight funds that may be used as a secondary source of liquidity to the extent the securities are not pledged for collateral. Other potential sources of liquidity include the sale of loans, the utilization of available government and regulatory assistance programs, the ability to acquire brokered deposits, the issuance of additional collateralized borrowings such as Federal Home Loan Bank, or FHLB, advances, the issuance of debt or equity securities and borrowings through the Federal Reserve's discount window. Without sufficient liquidity from these potential sources, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and borrowers.\nAdditionally, our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors specific to us, the financial services industry or the economy in general. Factors that could reduce our access to liquidity sources include a downturn in our local or national economies, difficult or illiquid credit markets or adverse regulatory actions against us. A failure to maintain adequate liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our regulatory standing, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may become liable for environmental remediation and other costs on repossessed properties, which could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. If hazardous or toxic substances are found on these properties, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property's value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur systems of internal operating controls may not be effective.\nWe establish and maintain systems of internal operational controls that provide us with critical information used to manage our business. These systems are subject to various inherent limitations, including cost, judgments used in decision-making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error and the risk of fraud. Moreover, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or processes and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time. Because of these limitations, any system of internal operating controls may not be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management. From time to time, control deficiencies and losses from operational malfunctions or fraud have occurred and may occur in the future. Any future deficiencies, weaknesses or losses related to internal operating control systems could have an adverse effect on our business and, in turn, on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as how we are perceived by our customers, regulators and investors.\nWe face significant competition from other financial institutions and financial services providers.\nWe face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources, higher lending limits and larger branch networks. Such competitors primarily include national and regional banks within the various markets we serve. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including, savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, factoring companies, financial technology firms and other financial intermediaries. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Increased competition among financial services companies due to the recent consolidation of certain competing financial institutions and the conversion of certain investment banks to bank holding companies may adversely affect our ability to market our products and services. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic funds transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, some competitors may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe ability to develop, maintain and build upon customer relationships based on quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets;\n\u2022\nthe ability to expand our market position;\n\u2022\nthe scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands;\n\u2022\nthe rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors;\n\u2022\ncustomer satisfaction with our level of service; and\n\u2022\nindustry and general economic trends.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations rely on certain external vendors.\nWe are reliant upon certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations. Failure of certain external vendors to perform in accordance with contractual arrangements could be disruptive to our operations and limit our ability to provide certain products and services demanded by our customers, which could have material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties. For example, we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services companies or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to increased credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client.\nWe may not effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to perform more efficiently. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to use technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur Bank's ability to pay dividends to us is subject to regulatory limitations, which, to the extent we are not able to receive such dividends, may impair our ability to grow, pay dividends, cover operating expenses and meet debt service requirements.\nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank, our only bank subsidiary. Since we are a holding company with no significant assets other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries, we depend upon dividends from the Bank for a substantial part of our revenue. Accordingly, our ability to pay dividends, cover operating expenses and acquire other institutions depends primarily upon the receipt of dividends or other capital distributions from the Bank. The Bank's ability to pay dividends to us is subject to, among other things, its earnings, financial condition and need for funds, as well as federal and state governmental policies and regulations applicable to us and the Bank, which limit the amount that may be paid as dividends without prior approval. For example, in general, the Bank is limited to paying dividends that do not exceed the current year net profits together with retained earnings from the two preceding calendar years unless the prior consent of the Federal Reserve is obtained. In addition, the Bank may not pay dividends in excess of the previous two years' net earnings without providing notice to the Montana Division.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Our Pending Acquisition of Cascade Bancorp\nThe success of the merger and integration of Cascade Bancorp will depend on a number of uncertain factors that could materially and adversely affect the financial condition and results of our operations and that of the combined company or prevent the combined company from realizing the anticipated benefits of the merger.\nThe success of the merger and the ability to realize the its anticipated benefits will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to integrate the branches acquired from Cascade Bancorp into our current operations;\n\u2022\nour ability to limit the outflow of deposits held by customers of the acquired branches and to successfully retain and manage interest-earning assets acquired in the merger;\n\u2022\nour ability to control the incremental non-interest expense of the acquired branches in a manner that enables us to maintain a favorable overall efficiency ratio;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain and attract the appropriate personnel to staff the acquired branches; and\n\u2022\nour ability to earn acceptable levels of interest and non-interest income, including fee income, from the acquired branches.\nIntegrating the acquired branches will be an operation of substantial size and expense, and may be affected by general market and economic conditions or government actions affecting the financial industry generally. Integration efforts will also likely divert our management\u2019s attention and resources. We may not be able to integrate the acquired branches successfully, and the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. We may also encounter unexpected difficulties or costs during the integration that could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition, perhaps materially. Additionally, the operation of the acquired branches may adversely affect our existing profitability, we may not be able to achieve results in the future similar to those achieved by the existing banking business or we may not be able to manage growth resulting from the merger effectively.\nFailure to complete the merger could negatively impact our stock prices, future business and financial results.\nThere can be no assurance that our announced merger with Cascade Bancorp will be completed. If the merger is not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nWe will be required to pay certain costs relating to the merger, whether or not the merger is completed, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor, proxy solicitation and printing fees;\n\u2022\nUnder the merger agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of business before completing the merger, which may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies if the merger is terminated; and\n\u2022\nmatters relating to the merger may require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us as an independent company.\nIn addition, if the merger is not completed, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from customers and employees. We also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to proceedings commenced by us against Cascade Bancorp seeking damages or to compel Cascade Bancorp to perform its obligations under the merger agreement. These factors and similar risks could have an adverse effect on our results of operation, business and stock price.\nOur shareholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the merger and will exercise less influence over the combined organization.\nOur shareholders currently have the right to vote in the election of members for our board of directors and on various other matters affecting us. Upon the completion of the merger, our Class A common stockholders will have their ownership interests diluted by approximately 9.7% and voting interests diluted by approximately 1.2%; and, the holders of our Class B common stock will have their ownership interests diluted by approximately 10.4% and voting interests diluted by approximately 6.4%.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nOur common stock share price could be volatile and could decline.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock is volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nprevailing market conditions;\n\u2022\nour historical performance and capital structure;\n\u2022\nestimates of our business potential and earnings prospects;\n\u2022\nan overall assessment of our management;\n\u2022\nconversion by our Class B shareholders of their shares into Class A common stock to liquidate their holdings;\n\u2022\nour performance relative to our peers;\n\u2022\nmarket demand for our shares;\n\u2022\nperceptions of the banking industry in general;\n\u2022\npolitical influences on investor sentiment; and,\n\u2022\nconsumer confidence.\nAt times the stock markets, including the NASDAQ Stock Market, on which our Class A common stock is listed, may experience significant price and volume fluctuations. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock is likely to be similarly volatile and investors in our Class A common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. Further, because our Class B common stock is convertible on a share-for-share basis into Class A common stock and the share price of our Class B common stock is based upon the share price of our Class A common stock, our Class B stock price is similarly impacted by the factors listed above.\nIn addition, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources.\nOur dividend policy may change.\nAlthough we have historically paid dividends to our stockholders, we have no obligation to continue doing so and may change our dividend policy at any time without notice to our stockholders. Holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such cash dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. The amount of any dividend declaration is subject to our evaluation of our strategic plans, growth initiatives, capital availability, projected liquidity needs and other factors.\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit.\nOur Class A and Class B common stock is not a bank savings account or deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or any other public or private entity. As a result, holders of our common stock could lose some or all of their investment.\nHolders of the Class B common stock have voting control of our company and are able to determine virtually all matters submitted to stockholders, including potential change in control transactions.\nMembers of the Scott family control in excess of 77% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Due to their holdings of common stock, members of the Scott family are able to determine the outcome of virtually all matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our articles of incorporation (except when a class vote is required by law), any merger or consolidation requiring common stockholder approval and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. Accordingly, such holders have the ability to prevent change in control transactions as long as they maintain voting control of the company.\nIn addition, because these holders have the ability to elect all of our directors they are able to control our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our common stock or other securities, the payments of dividends on our common stock and entering into extraordinary transactions, and their interests may not in all cases be aligned with the interests of all stockholders. The Scott family members have entered into a stockholder agreement giving family members a right of first refusal to purchase shares of Class B common stock that are intended to be sold or transferred, subject to certain exceptions, by other family members. This agreement may have the effect of continuing ownership of the Class B common stock and control within the Scott family. This concentrated control limits stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\n\u201cAnti-takeover\u201d provisions and the regulations to which we are subject also may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to stockholders.\nWe are a financial and bank holding company incorporated in the State of Montana. Anti-takeover provisions in Montana law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as regulatory approvals that would be required under federal law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our Class A common stock. These provisions could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock and could reduce the amount that Class A and Class B stockholders might receive if we are sold.\nOur articles of incorporation provide that our Board may issue up to 100,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, without stockholder approval and with such terms, conditions, rights, privileges and preferences as the Board may deem appropriate. In addition, our articles of incorporation provide for staggered terms for our Board and limitations on persons authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders. In addition, certain provisions of Montana law may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of such Class A common stock.\nFurther, the acquisition of specified amounts of our common stock (in some cases, the acquisition or control of more than 5% of our voting stock) may require certain regulatory approvals, including the approval of the Federal Reserve and one or more of our state banking regulatory agencies. The filing of applications with these agencies and the accompanying review process can take several months. Additionally, as discussed above, the holders of the Class B common stock will have voting control of our company. This and the other factors described above may hinder or even prevent a change in control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nWe qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules and may rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nAs a result of the combined voting power of the members of the Scott family described above, we qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. As a controlled company, we may rely on exemptions from certain NASDAQ corporate governance standards that are available to controlled companies, including the requirements that:\n\u2022\na majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors;\n\u2022\nthe compensation of officers be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors; and\n\u2022\ndirector nominees be selected, or recommended for the board of directors' selection, by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee comprised solely of independent directors with a written charter or board resolution addressing the nomination process.\nAs a result, in the future, our compensation and governance and nominating committees may not consist entirely of independent directors. As long as we choose to rely on these exemptions from NASDAQ Marketplace Rules in the future, you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NASDAQ corporate governance requirements.\nFuture equity issuances could result in dilution, which could cause our common stock price to decline.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional Class A common stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, Class A common stock. We may issue additional Class A common stock in the future pursuant to current or future employee equity compensation plans or in connection with future acquisitions or financings. Should we choose to raise capital by selling shares of Class A common stock for any reason, the issuance would have a dilutive effect on the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock and could have a material negative effect on the market price of our Class A common stock.\nThe common stock is equity and is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness.\nShares of our Class A and Class B common stock are equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness. As such, shares of our Class A and Class B common stock rank junior to all our indebtedness, including any subordinated term loans, subordinated debentures held by trusts that have issued trust preferred securities other non-equity claims on us with respect to assets available to satisfy claims on us. In the future, we may make additional offerings of debt or equity securities or, we may issue additional debt or equity securities as consideration for future mergers and acquisitions.", "PERMNO": 93304, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FIBK"}
