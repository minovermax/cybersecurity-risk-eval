If any of the following risks or other risks, which have not been identified or which we may believe are immaterial or unlikely, actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In such a case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS\nWe may experience increased delinquencies and credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition and results of operations.\nLike other lenders, we face the risk that our customers will not repay their loans. A customer\u2019s failure to repay us is usually preceded by missed monthly payments. In some instances, however, a customer may declare bankruptcy prior to missing payments, and, following a borrower filing bankruptcy, a lender\u2019s recovery of the credit extended is often limited. Since our loans are secured by collateral, we may attempt to seize the collateral when and if customers default on their loans. However, the value of the collateral may not equal the amount of the unpaid loan, and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from our customers. Elevated levels of delinquencies and bankruptcies in our market area generally and among our customers specifically can be precursors of future charge-offs and may require us to increase our allowance for loan and lease losses. Higher charge-off rates and an increase in our allowance for loan and lease losses may hurt our overall financial performance if we are unable to increase revenue to compensate for these losses and may also increase our cost of funds.\nOur allowance for loan and lease losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and we may be required to materially increase our allowance, which may adversely affect our capital, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expenses, that represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable credit losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans. The allowance for loan and lease losses and our methodology for calculating the allowance are fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements under \u201cAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d, and in the \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis-Statement of Financial Condition-Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d section. In general, an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses results in a decrease in net income, and possibly risk-based capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe allowance, in the judgment of management, is established to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks using existing qualitative and quantitative information, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of additional loan charge offs, based on judgments that are different than those of management. As we are consistently adjusting our loan portfolio and underwriting standards to reflect current market conditions, we can provide no assurance that our methodology will not change, which could result in a charge to earnings.\nWe continually reassess the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the sufficiency of our allowance for loan and lease losses as part of FSGBank\u2019s credit functions. Any significant amount of additional non-performing assets, loan charge-offs, increases in the provision for loan losses or the continuation of aggressive charge-off policies or any inability by us to realize the full value of underlying collateral in the event of a loan default, will negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and the price of our securities. Our allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2014 may not be sufficient to cover future credit losses.\nWe make and hold in our portfolio a number of land acquisition and development and construction loans, which pose more credit risk than other types of loans typically made by financial institutions.\nWe offer land acquisition and development, and construction loans for builders and developers, and as of December 31, 2014, we had $47.8 million in such loans outstanding, representing 47.5% of FSGBank\u2019s total risk-based capital. These land acquisition and development, and construction loans are more risky than other types of loans. The primary credit risks associated with land acquisition and development and construction lending are underwriting and project risks. Project risks include cost overruns, borrower credit risk, project completion risk, general contractor credit risk, and environmental and other\nhazard risks. Market risks are risks associated with the sale of the completed residential units. They include affordability risk, which means the risk that borrowers cannot obtain affordable financing, product design risk, and risks posed by competing projects. Losses in our land acquisition and development and construction loan portfolio could exceed our reserves, which would adversely impact our earnings. Non-performing loans in our land acquisition and development and construction portfolio could increase during 2015, and these non-performing loans could result in a material level of charge-offs, which would negatively impact our capital and earnings.\nIf the value of real estate in our core markets were to decline, a significant portion of our loan portfolio could become under-collateralized, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn addition to considering the financial strength and cash flow characteristics of borrowers, we often secure loans with real estate collateral. At December 31, 2014, approximately 84.7% of our loans had real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower but may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. If the value of real estate in our core markets were to decline further, a significant portion of our loan portfolio could become under-collateralized. As a result, if we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, our earnings and capital could be adversely affected.\nThe amount of our OREO may result in additional losses, and costs and expenses that will negatively affect our operations.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had a total of $4.5 million of OREO. The costs and expenses to maintain the real estate are proportionate to our level of OREO. The amount of OREO could remain at current levels or elevate in the future. Any additional increase in losses, and maintenance costs and expenses due to OREO may have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Such effects may be particularly pronounced in a market of reduced real estate values and excess inventory, which may make the disposition of OREO properties more difficult, increase maintenance costs and expenses, and may reduce our ultimate realization from any OREO sales.\nOur use of appraisals in deciding whether to make a loan on or secured by real property or how to value such loan in the future may not accurately describe the net value of the real property collateral that we can realize.\nIn considering whether to make a loan secured by real property, we generally require an appraisal of the property. However, an appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made, and, as real estate values in our market area have experienced changes in value in relatively short periods of time, this estimate might not accurately describe the net value of the real property collateral after the loan has been closed. If the appraisal does not reflect the amount that may be obtained upon any sale or foreclosure of the property, we may not realize an amount equal to the indebtedness secured by the property. The valuation of the property may negatively impact the continuing value of such loan and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe will realize additional future losses if the proceeds we receive upon liquidation of non-performing assets are less than the fair value of such assets.\nWe have announced a strategy to manage our non-performing assets aggressively, a portion of which may not be currently identified. Non-performing assets are recorded on our financial statements at fair value, as required under GAAP, unless these assets have been specifically identified for liquidation, in which case they are recorded at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. In current market conditions, we are likely to realize additional future losses if the proceeds we receive upon dispositions of non-performing assets are less than the recorded fair value of such assets.\nWe are subject to risks in the event of certain borrower defaults, which could have an adverse impact on our liquidity position and results of operations.\nWe may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of certain borrower defaults, which could adversely affect our liquidity position, results of operations, and financial condition. When we sell mortgage loans, we are required to make customary representations and warranties to the purchaser about the mortgage loans and the manner in which the loans were originated. In the event of a breach of any of the representations and warranties related to a loan sold, we could be liable for damages to the investor up to and including a \u201cmake whole\u201d demand that involves, at the investor\u2019s option, either reimbursing the investor for actual losses incurred on the loan or repurchasing the loan in full. Our maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of make whole loan repurchase claim would be the unpaid principal balance of the loan to be repurchased along with any premium paid by the investor when the loan was purchased and other minor collection cost reimbursements. While we have taken steps to enhance our underwriting policies and procedures, these steps might not be effective and might not lessen the risks associated with loans sold in the past. If repurchase demands increase, our liquidity position, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nNegative publicity about financial institutions, generally, or about First Security or FSGBank, specifically, could damage First Security\u2019s reputation and adversely impact its liquidity, business operations or financial results.\nReputation risk, or the risk to our business from negative publicity, is inherent in our business. Negative publicity can result from the actual or alleged conduct of financial institutions, generally, or First Security or FSGBank, specifically, in any number of activities, including leasing and lending practices, corporate governance, and actions taken by government regulators in response to those activities. Negative publicity can adversely affect our ability to keep and attract customers and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action, any of which could negatively affect our liquidity, business operations or financial results.\nIncreases in our expenses and other costs could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur expenses and other costs, such as operating expenses and hiring new employees directly affect our earnings results. In light of the extremely competitive environment in which we operate, and because the size and scale of many of our competitors provides them with increased operational efficiencies, it is important that we are able to successfully manage such expenses. We are aggressively managing our expenses in the current economic environment, but as our business develops, changes or expands, and as we hire additional personnel, additional expenses can arise. Other factors that can affect the amount of our expenses include legal and administrative cases and proceedings, which can be expensive to pursue or defend. In addition, changes in accounting policies can significantly affect how we calculate expenses and earnings.\nChanges in the interest rate environment could reduce our net interest income, which could reduce our profitability.\nAs a financial institution, our earnings significantly depend on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on interest-earning assets, such as investment securities and loans, and the interest expense that we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Therefore, any change in general market interest rates, including changes in the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s fiscal and monetary policies, affects us more than non-financial institutions and can have a significant effect on our net interest income and total income. Our assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions because there may be mismatches between the repricing or maturity characteristics of the assets and liabilities. As a result, an increase or decrease in market interest rates could have material adverse effects on our net interest margin and results of operations.\nIn addition, we cannot predict whether interest rates will continue to remain at present levels. Changes in interest rates may cause significant changes, up or down, in our net interest income. Depending on our portfolio of loans and investments, our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. In addition, any significant increase in prevailing interest rates could adversely affect our mortgage banking business because higher interest rates could cause customers to request fewer re-financings and purchase money mortgage originations.\nWe face strong competition from larger, more established competitors that may inhibit our ability to compete and expose us to greater lending risks.\nThe banking business is highly competitive, and we experience strong competition from many other financial institutions. We compete with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds and other financial institutions, which operate in our primary market areas and elsewhere.\nWe compete with these institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans. In addition, we have to attract our customer base from other existing financial institutions and from new residents. Many of our competitors are well-established and much larger financial institutions. While we believe we can and do successfully compete with these other financial\ninstitutions in our markets, we may face a competitive disadvantage as a result of our smaller size and lack of geographic diversification.\nOur relatively small geographic footprint limits our ability to diversify macro-economic risk. We lend primarily to individuals and to small to medium-sized businesses, which may expose us to greater lending risks than those of banks lending to larger, better capitalized businesses with longer operating histories. As an example, our market area in northern Georgia is highly dependent on the home furnishings and carpet industry centered near Dalton, Georgia. During the last recession and the accompanying downturn in residential construction, this industry suffered a business decline, which adversely affected the performance of our operations in Dalton and surrounding areas. As a community bank, we are less able to spread the risk of unfavorable local economic conditions than larger or more regional banks. Moreover, we cannot give any assurance that we will benefit from any market growth or favorable economic conditions in our primary market areas if they do occur.\nThe soundness of our financial condition may also affect our competitiveness. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Customers may decide not to do business with us due to our financial condition. In addition, our ability to compete is impacted by the limitations on our activities imposed under the Order and the Agreement. We have faced and continue to face, additional regulatory restrictions that our competitors may not be subject to, including improving the overall risk profile of the Company and restrictions on the amount of interest we can pay on deposit accounts, which could adversely impact our ability to compete and attract and retain customers.\nAlthough we compete by concentrating our marketing efforts in our primary market area with local advertisements, personal contacts and greater flexibility in working with local customers, we can give no assurance that this strategy will be successful.\nThe costs and effects of litigation, investigations or similar matters, or adverse facts and developments related thereto, could materially affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation, investigations or similar matters arising out of our business. Our insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against it and indemnification rights to which we are entitled may not be honored, and any claims asserted against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm our reputation. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation or investigation significantly exceed our insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, premiums for insurance covering the financial and banking sectors are rising. We may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, nor may we be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms or at historic rates, if at all.\nChanges in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, the status of examinations by tax authorities and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance could materially affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to various taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business. We assess the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent and other pertinent information and maintain tax accruals consistent with our evaluation. This evaluation incorporates assumptions and estimates that involve a high degree of judgment and subjectivity. Changes in the results of these evaluations could have a material impact on our operating results.\nEnvironmental liability associated with lending activities could result in losses.\nIn the course of our business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing our loans. If hazardous substances are discovered on any of these properties, we may be liable to governmental entities or third parties for the costs of remediation of the hazard, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Many environmental laws can impose liability regardless of whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the contamination. In addition, if we arrange for the disposal of hazardous or toxic substances at another site, we may be liable for the costs of cleaning up and removing those substances from the site, even if we neither own nor operate the disposal site. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially limit the use of properties that we acquire through foreclosure, reduce their value or limit our ability to sell them in the event of a default on the loans they secure. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Our loan policies require certain due diligence of high risk industries and properties with the intention of lowering our risk of a non-performing loan and/or foreclosed property.\nWe may not be able to retain, attract and motivate qualified individuals.\nOur success depends on our ability to retain, attract and motivate qualified individuals in key positions throughout the organization. Competition for qualified individuals in most activities in which we are engaged can be intense, and we may not be able to hire or retain the people we want and/or need. Although we maintain employment agreements with certain key employees, and have incentive compensation plans aimed, in part, at long-term employee retention, the unexpected loss of services of one or\nmore of our key personnel could still occur, and such events may have a material adverse impact on our business because of the loss of the employee's skills, knowledge of our market, and years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. If we are unable to retain, attract and motivate qualified individuals in key positions, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems, or those of our third party service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt our business, result in unintentional disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and adversely impact our earnings.\nAs a financial institution, our operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks. Any failure, interruption or breach in security or operational integrity of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our Internet banking system, treasury management products, check and document imaging, remote deposit capture systems, general ledger, and other systems. The security and integrity of our systems could be threatened by a variety of interruptions or information security breaches, including those caused by computer hacking, cyber-attacks, electronic fraudulent activity or attempted theft of financial assets. We cannot assure you that any such failures, interruption or security breaches will not occur, or if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. While we have certain protective policies and procedures in place, the nature and sophistication of the threats continue to evolve. We may be required to expend significant additional resources in the future to modify and enhance our protective measures.\nAdditionally, we face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing agents, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems. Any failures, interruptions or security breaches in our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, or expose us to civil litigation, regulatory fines or losses not covered by insurance.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nOur business operations rely on third party vendors to provide services such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including but not limited to those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches at a vendor, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor's ability to serve us. Furthermore, our vendors could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. Replacing these third party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO RECENT MARKET, LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY EVENTS\nAn economic downturn in the housing market, the homebuilding industry, and / or in our markets generally could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur long-term success depends upon the growth in population, income levels, deposits and housing starts in our primary market areas. If the communities in which FSGBank operates do not grow, or if prevailing economic conditions locally or nationally are unfavorable, our business may not succeed. An economic recession over a prolonged period or other economic problems in our market areas could have a material adverse impact on the quality of the loan portfolio and the demand for our products and services. Future adverse changes in the economies in our market areas may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Further, the banking industry in Tennessee and Georgia is affected by general economic conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment and other factors beyond our control.\nThe homebuilding and residential mortgage industry has experienced a significant and sustained decline in demand for new homes and a decrease in the absorption of new and existing homes available for sale in various markets. Our customers who are builders and developers face greater difficulty in selling their homes in markets where these trends are more pronounced. Consequently, we are facing increased delinquencies and non-performing assets as these builders and developers are forced to default on their loans with us. We do not know when or to what extent the housing market will improve, and accordingly, additional downgrades, provisions for loan losses and charge-offs related to our loan portfolio may occur. If market conditions continue to deteriorate, our non-performing assets may continue to increase and we may need to take additional valuation adjustments on our loan portfolios and real estate owned as we continue to reassess the market value of our loan portfolio, the losses associated with the loans in default and the net realizable value of real estate owned.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations may adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act enacted on July 21, 2010, created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\") with power to promulgate and enforce consumer protection laws. Smaller depository institutions, including those with $10 billion or less in assets, will be subject to the CFPB's rule-writing authority, and existing depository institution regulatory agencies will retain examination and enforcement authority for such institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act also establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury with authority to identify institutions and practices that might pose a systemic risk and, among other things, includes provisions affecting (1) corporate governance and executive compensation of all companies whose securities are registered with the SEC, (2) FDIC insurance assessments, (3) interchange fees for debit cards, which would be set by the Federal Reserve under a restrictive \u201creasonable and proportional cost\u201d per transaction standard and (4) minimum capital levels for bank holding companies, subject to a grandfather clause for financial institutions with less than $15 billion in assets.\nThe CFPB has broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks, including the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act enhanced the regulation of mortgage banking and gave to the CFPB oversight of many of the core laws which regulate the mortgage industry and the authority to implement mortgage regulations. New regulations adopted and anticipated to be adopted by the CFPB will significantly impact consumer mortgage lending and servicing.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and the resulting regulations will likely affect the Company's business and operations in other ways which are difficult to predict at this time. However, compliance with these new laws and regulations will result in additional costs, which may adversely impact the Company's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, any of which may impact the market price of the Company's common stock.\nThe CFPB\u2019s \"ability-to-repay\" and \"qualified mortgage\" rules could have a negative impact on our loan origination process and foreclosure proceedings.\nThe CFPB has adopted rules that are likely to impact our residential mortgage lending practices, and the residential mortgage market generally including rules that implement the \"ability-to-repay\" requirement and provide protection from liability for \"qualified mortgages,\" as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The ability-to-repay rule, which took effect on January 10, 2014, requires lenders to consider, among other things, income, employment status, assets, payment amounts, and credit history before approving a mortgage, and provides a compliance \"safe harbor\" for lenders that issue certain \"qualified mortgages.\" The rules define a \"qualified mortgage\" to have certain specified characteristics, and generally prohibit loans with negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years from being qualified mortgages. The rule also establishes general underwriting criteria for qualified mortgages, including that monthly payments be calculated based on the highest payment that will apply in the first five years of the loan and that the borrower have a total debt-to-income ratio that is less than or equal to 43 percent. While \"qualified mortgages\" will generally be afforded safe harbor status, a rebuttable presumption of compliance will attach to mortgages that also meet the definition of a \"higher priced mortgage\" (which are generally subprime loans). Although the new \"qualified mortgage\" rules may provide better definition and more certainty regarding regulatory requirements, the rules may also increase our compliance burden and reduce our lending flexibility and discretion, which could negatively impact our ability to originate new loans and the cost of originating new loans. Any loans that we make outside of the \"qualified mortgage\" criteria could expose us to an increased risk of liability and reduce or delay our ability to foreclose on the underlying property. Additionally, qualified \"higher priced mortgages\" only provide a rebuttable presumption of compliance and thus may be more susceptible to challenges from borrowers. It is difficult to predict how the CFPB's \"qualified mortgage\" rules will impact us, but any decreases in loan origination volume or increases in compliance and foreclosure costs could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe CFPB may reshape the consumer financial laws through rulemaking and enforcement of unfair, deceptive or abusive practices, which may directly impact the business operations of depository institutions offering consumer financial products or services including the Bank.\nRecently, banking regulatory agencies have increasingly used a general consumer protection statute to address \"unethical\" or otherwise \"bad\" business practices that may not necessarily fall directly under the purview of a specific banking or consumer finance law. The law of choice for enforcement against such business practices has been Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act-the primary federal law that prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices and unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce (\"UDAP\" or \"FTC Act\"). \"Unjustified consumer injury\" is the principal focus of the FTC Act. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, there was little formal guidance to provide insight to the parameters for compliance with the UDAP law. However, the UDAP provisions have been expanded under the Dodd-Frank Act to apply to \"unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices\" (\"UDAAP\"), which has been delegated to the CFPB for supervision. The CFPB has published its first Supervision and Examination Manual that addresses compliance with and the examination of UDAAP. The potential reach of the CFPB's broad new rulemaking powers and UDAAP authority on the operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services including the Bank is currently unknown.\nThe Federal Reserve has adopted new capital requirements for financial institutions that may require us to retain or raise additional capital and/or reduce dividends.\nOn July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve adopted final rules that, when effective beginning on January 1, 2015, increased regulatory capital requirements, implemented changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act and implemented portions of the Basel III regulatory capital reforms. In the future, the capital requirements for bank holding companies may require us to retain or raise additional capital, restrict our ability to pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock, restrict our ability to provide certain forms of discretionary executive compensation and/or require other changes to our strategic plans. The impact of these rules cannot yet be fully understood. The rules could restrict our ability to grow and implement our future business strategies, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe trading volume of our common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies.\nAlthough our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the trading volume of our common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies. For the public trading market for our common stock to have the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness requires the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the lower trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause our stock price to fall more than would otherwise be expected if the trading volume of our common stock were commensurate with the trading volumes of the common stock of larger financial services companies.\nWe may undergo an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, which could affect our ability to fully utilize our deferred tax assets.\nThe Company has previously experienced substantial net operating losses, which it may carryforward in certain circumstances to offset current and future taxable income and thus reduce its federal income tax liability. However, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change to utilize its deferred tax assets, including net operating losses, existing as of the date of such ownership change. If we were to undergo an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382, a portion of our deferred tax assets existing as of the date of such ownership change may become unavailable to offset future federal and state tax liabilities.\nProvisions in our amended and restated Articles of Incorporation, our amended and restated Bylaws, Tennessee law and our Tax Benefits Preservation Plan limit the ability of others to acquire us and may, therefore, adversely affect our the price of our common stock.\nVarious anti-takeover protections for Tennessee corporations are set forth in the Tennessee Business Corporation Act, the Business Combination Act, the Control Share Acquisition Act, the Greenmail Act and the Investor Protection Act. Because our common stock is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Business Combination Act automatically applies to us unless our stockholders adopt a charter or bylaw amendment which expressly excludes us from the anti-takeover provisions of the Business Combination Act two years prior to a proposed takeover. Our Board of Directors has no present intention of recommending such charter or bylaw amendment.\nThese statutes have the general effect of discouraging, or rendering more difficult, unfriendly takeover or acquisition attempts. Such provisions could be beneficial to current management in an unfriendly takeover attempt but could have an adverse effect on stockholders who might wish to participate in such a transaction.\nOn October 24, 2012, our Board of Directors adopted a Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, which is intended to prevent certain transactions that would constitute an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code in order to protect the ability of the Company to realize the benefits of the Company's net operating losses. The Tax Benefits Preservation Plan is designed to prevent transfers of our common stock that would result in any stockholder owning 4.9% or more of our common stock or to prevent any existing 4.9% stockholder from acquiring additional shares by substantially diluting the ownership interest of any such stockholder, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, on March 20, 2013 the Company adopted an amendment to its Bylaws, applicable to shares issued after that date, that makes such attempted transfers void. Because the Tax Benefit Preservation Plan may restrict a stockholder's ability to acquire our common stock, it could discourage a tender offer or make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a controlling position in our stock without our approval, and the market value of the Company's common stock may be adversely affected while the Tax Benefit Preservation Plan is in effect.\nOur future operating results may be below securities analysts\u2019 or investors\u2019 expectations, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may be unable to generate significant revenues or grow at the rate expected by securities analysts or investors. In addition, our costs may be higher than we, securities analysts or investors expect. If we fail to generate sufficient revenues or our costs are higher than we expect, our results of operations will suffer, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur operating results in any particular period may not be a reliable indication of our future performance. In some future quarters, our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If this occurs, the price of our common stock will likely decline.", "PERMNO": 90862, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FSGI"}
