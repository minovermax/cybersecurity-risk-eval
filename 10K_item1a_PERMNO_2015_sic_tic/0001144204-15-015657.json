{"cik": "43350", "company": "Gas Natural Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our common stock involves a substantial degree of risk. Before making an investment decision, you should give careful consideration to the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this report. The following risk factors, however, may not reflect all of the risks associated with our business or an investment in our common stock.\nRisks Related To Our Business\nWe are subject to comprehensive regulation by federal, state and local regulatory agencies that impact the rates we are able to charge, our costs and profitability.\nThe public utility commissions in states where we operate and the FERC regulate many aspects of our distribution and transmission operations. State regulatory agencies set the rates that we may charge customers, which effectively limit the rate of return we are permitted to realize. Our ability to obtain rate increases and rate supplements to maintain the current rate of return and/or recover costs depends upon regulatory discretion. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain rate increases or rate supplements or continue to receive the current authorized rates of return, which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. The state utility regulatory agencies also regulate our public utilities\u2019 gas purchases, construction and maintenance of facilities, the terms of service to our customers, safety and various other aspects of our distribution operations. FERC regulates interstate transportation and storage of natural gas. To the extent that our utilities have contracts for transportation and storage services under FERC-approved tariffs with interstate pipelines, our utilities are subject to FERC rules and regulations pertaining to those services. If we fail to comply with applicable state and federal regulations, we may be subject to fines or penalties.\nOur gas purchase practices are subject to annual reviews by state regulatory agencies which could impact our earnings and cash flow.\nThe regulatory agencies that oversee our utility operations may review retrospectively our purchases of natural gas on an annual basis. The purpose of these annual reviews is to reconcile the differences, if any, between the amount we paid for natural gas and the amount our customers paid for natural gas. If any costs are disallowed in this review process, these disallowed costs would be expensed in the cost of gas but would not be recoverable in the rates charged to our customers. Significant disallowances could affect our earnings and cash flow.\nThe PUCO examined NEO and Orwell under the GCR mechanism. NEO\u2019s audit covered the GCR mechanism from September 2009 through February 2012, and Orwell\u2019s GCR mechanism covered July 2010 through June 2012. On November 13, 2013, the PUCO issued an Opinion and Order in these GCR cases that disallowed our recovery of $1.0 million, primarily fees paid to JDOG Marketing, and fines of $76,000. In addition, the order called for an investigative and forensic audit of NEO, Orwell and all affiliated and related companies and their internal management controls to be undertaken by an outside auditor. The results of this audit were released on January 23, 2015. The report made various recommendations primarily, regarding the Company\u2019s Ohio GCR filings, business structure, and internal controls. The PUCO has yet to comment on any actions it may take as a result of this report. Depending on the PUCO\u2019s actions, the Company could be subject to additional civil fines, restrictions, changes or limitations to, or cessation of, existing operations in Ohio, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and stock price.\nWe currently are involved in shareholder derivative lawsuits and other related legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition.\nBeginning on December 10, 2013, five shareholder derivative complaints were filed in federal court against Gas Natural, as a nominal defendant, and against certain of our current and former directors and officers, as real defendants. We may also be subject to additional lawsuits, investigations or proceedings in the future that relate to the allegations set forth in these derivative actions. On February 6, 2014, the five lawsuits were consolidated solely for purposes of conducting limited pretrial discovery, and on February 21, 2014, the Court appointed lead counsel for all five lawsuits. No formal discovery has been conducted to date. The consolidated action contains claims against various current or former directors or officers of Gas Natural alleging, among other things, violations of federal securities laws, breaches of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment arising primarily out of our acquisition of the Ohio utilities, services provided by JDOG Marketing and the acquisition of JDOG Marketing, and the sale of our common stock by Richard M. Osborne, the Company\u2019s former chairman and chief executive officer, and Thomas J. Smith, a former director of the Company and its former chief financial officer. The suit seeks the recovery of unspecified damages allegedly sustained by Gas Natural, which is named as a nominal defendant, corporate reforms, disgorgement, restitution, the recovery of plaintiffs\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees and other relief. A more detailed description of these lawsuits and others is contained in Part I Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOn March 26, 2014, the board formed a special committee in response to a shareholder demand letter. The letter demanded the board take legal action to remedy alleged conduct detailed in the November 13, 2013 PUCO Opinion and Order.\nWe are a nominal defendant in the pending shareholder derivative suits, and none of the plaintiffs are seeking recovery from Gas Natural. However, we have certain indemnification obligations to the named defendants, including the advancement of defense costs to the individuals. The expenses related to continuing to defend such litigation may be significant. We cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits or for how long they will remain active. Regardless of the outcome, the pending lawsuits, and any other related litigation, proceedings or investigations, including the outcome of the investigation of the special committee, that may be brought against us or our current or former officers and directors in the future could be time-consuming, result in significant expense and divert the attention and resources of our management and other key employees from the operation of our business. Moreover, negative developments with respect to the pending lawsuits and investigation could cause our stock price to decline. We could also be required to pay damages or other monetary penalties imposed on our directors and officers as a result of the foregoing matters. Any expenses, damages or settlement amounts involved in these matters could exceed coverage provided under our applicable insurance policies. Any unfavorable outcome of the pending shareholder cases and investigation could harm our business and financial condition, results of operation or cash flows.\nWe currently are involved in litigation with Richard M. Osborne, our former chairman and chief executive officer, that could result in significant expense to defend.\nBeginning on June 13, 2014, Richard M. Osborne, father of our chief executive officer and our former chairman and chief executive officer, has filed various lawsuits against us and certain of our officers and directors. A more detailed description of these lawsuits is contained in \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe expenses related to continuing to defend litigation initiated by Mr. Osborne may be significant. We cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits or for how long they will remain active. Regardless of the outcome, the pending lawsuits could be time-consuming, result in significant expense and divert the attention and resources of our management and other key employees from the operation of our business. Moreover, negative developments with respect to the pending lawsuits could cause our stock price to decline.\nOperational issues beyond our control could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe operate in geographically dispersed areas. Our ability to provide natural gas depends both on our own operations and facilities and those of third parties, including local gas producers and natural gas pipeline operators from whom we receive our natural gas supply. The loss of use or destruction of our facilities or the facilities of third parties due to extreme weather conditions, breakdowns, war, acts of terrorism or other occurrences could greatly reduce potential earnings and cash flows and increase our costs of repairs and replacement of assets. Our losses may not be fully recoverable through insurance or customer rates.\nStoring and transporting natural gas involves inherent risks that could cause us to incur significant financial losses.\nThere are inherent hazards and operation risks in gas distribution activities, such as leaks, accidental explosions and mechanical problems that could cause the loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of operations, and substantial losses to us. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. These activities may subject us to litigation and administrative proceedings that could result in substantial monetary judgments, fines or penalties against us. To the extent that the occurrence of any of these events is not fully covered by insurance, they could adversely affect our earnings and cash flow.\nOur earnings and cash flow are sensitive to decreases in customer consumption resulting from warmer than normal temperatures and customer conservation.\nOur natural gas sales revenue is generated primarily through the sale and delivery of natural gas to residential and commercial customers who use natural gas mainly for space heating. Consequently, temperatures have a significant impact on sales and revenue. Given the impact of weather on our utility operations, our business is a seasonal business. In addition, the average annual natural gas consumption of customers has been decreasing because, among other things, new homes and appliances are typically more energy efficient than older homes and appliances, and customers appear to be continuing a pattern of conserving energy by utilizing more energy efficient heating systems, insulation, alternative energy sources, and other energy savings devices and techniques. A mild winter, as well as continued or increased conservation, in any of our service areas can have a significant adverse impact on demand for natural gas and, consequently, earnings and cash flow.\nThe increased cost of purchasing natural gas during periods in which natural gas prices are rising significantly could adversely impact our earnings and cash flow.\nThe rates we are permitted to charge allow us to recover our cost of purchasing natural gas. In general, the various regulatory agencies allow us to recover the costs of natural gas purchased for customers on a dollar-for-dollar basis (in the absence of disallowances), without a profit component. We periodically adjust customer rates for increases and decreases in the cost of gas purchased by us for sale to our customers. Under the regulatory body-approved gas cost recovery pricing mechanisms, the gas commodity charge portion of gas rates we charge to our customers may be adjusted upward on a periodic basis. If the cost of purchasing natural gas increases and we are unable to recover these costs from our customers immediately, or at all, we may incur increased costs associated with higher working capital requirements. In addition, any increases in the cost of purchasing natural gas may result in higher customer bad debt expense for uncollectible accounts and reduced sales volume and related margins due to lower customer consumption.\nVolatility in the price of natural gas could result in customers switching to alternative energy sources which could reduce our revenue, earnings and cash flow.\nThe market price of alternative energy sources such as coal, electricity, propane, oil and steam is a competitive factor affecting the demand for our gas distribution services. Our customers may have or may acquire the capacity to use one or more of the alternative energy sources if the price of natural gas and our distribution services increase significantly. Natural gas has typically been less expensive than these alternative energy sources. However, if natural gas prices increase significantly, some of these alternative energy sources may become more economical or more attractive than natural gas, which could reduce our earnings and cash flow.\nThe gas industry is intensely competitive and competition has increased in recent years as a result of changes in the price negotiation process within the supply and distribution chain of the gas industry, both of which could negatively impact earnings.\nWe compete with companies from various regions of the United States and may compete with foreign companies for domestic sales. Many of these companies are larger and have greater financial, technological, human and other resources than we do. Additionally, legislative and regulatory initiatives, at both the federal and state levels, are designed to promote competition. These challenges have been compounded by changes in the gas industry that have allowed certain customers to negotiate gas purchases directly with producers or brokers. We could lose market share or our profit margins may decline in the future if we are unable to remain competitive.\nOur earnings and cash flow may be adversely affected by downturns in the economy.\nOur operations are affected by the conditions and overall strength of the national, regional and local economies, which impact the amount of residential and industrial growth and actual gas consumption in our service territories. Our industrial customers use natural gas in the production of their products. During economic downturns, these customers may see a decrease in demand for their products, which in turn may lead to a decrease in the amount of natural gas they require for production. In addition, during periods of slow or little economic growth, energy conservation efforts often increase and the amount of uncollectible customer accounts increases. These factors may reduce earnings and cash flow.\nChanges in the market price and transportation costs of natural gas could result in financial losses that would negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of natural gas. We purchase and store gas for distribution later in the year. We enter into agreements to buy or sell gas at a fixed price. We also enter into natural gas commodity swap agreements as the fixed price participant. We may use such arrangements to protect profit margins on future obligations to deliver gas at a fixed price, or to attempt to protect against adverse effects of potential market price declines on future obligations to purchase gas at fixed prices. Further, we are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by the counterparties to these agreements, which could have a material adverse impact on our earnings for a given period.\nChanges in current regulations, the regulatory environment and events in the energy markets that are beyond our control may reduce our earnings and limit our access to capital markets.\nAs a result of the energy crisis in California during 2000 and 2001, the bankruptcy of some energy companies, and the volatility of natural gas prices in North America, companies in regulated and unregulated energy businesses have generally been under increased scrutiny by regulators, participants in the capital markets and debt rating agencies. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the SEC may enact new accounting standards that could impact the way we are required to record revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities. In addition, state utility regulatory agencies could enact more stringent rules or standards with respect to rates, cost recovery, safety, construction, maintenance or other aspects of our operations. We cannot predict or control what effect proposed regulations, events in the energy markets or other future actions of regulatory agencies or others in response to such events may have on our earnings or access to the capital markets.\nWe acquired interests in our natural gas wells by quitclaim deed and cannot guarantee that we hold clear title to our interests or that our interests will not be challenged in the future.\nWe have an ownership interest in 160 natural gas producing wells in Montana, which provide our marketing and production operations a partial natural hedge when market prices of natural gas are greater than the cost of production. The gas production from these wells provided approximately 26% of the volume requirements for Energy West Resource\u2019s Montana market for 2014. We acquired our interests in the wells in 2002 and 2003 by quitclaim deed conveying interests in certain oil and gas leases for the wells. Because the sellers conveyed their interests by quitclaim, we received no warranty or representation from them that they owned their interests free and clear from adverse claims by third parties or other title defects. We have no title insurance, guaranty or warranty for our interests in the wells. Further, the wells may be subject to prior, unregistered agreements, or transfers which have not been recorded.\nAccordingly, we cannot guarantee that we hold clear title to our interests or that our interests will not be challenged in the future. If our interests were challenged, expenses for curative title work, litigation or other dispute resolution mechanisms may be incurred. Loss of our interests would reduce or eliminate our production operations and reduce or eliminate the partial natural hedge that our marketing and production subsidiary currently enjoys as a result of our production capabilities. For all of these reasons, a challenge to our ownership could negatively impact our earnings, profits and results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that may increase our cost of operations, impact our business plans and expose us to environmental liabilities.\nEnvironmental regulations that may affect our present and future operations include regulation of air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste and hazardous waste. These laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals, and can result in increased capital expenditures and operating costs. Both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations. We cannot predict the outcome (financial or operational) of any related litigation that may arise.\nWe may be a responsible party for environmental clean-up at sites identified by a regulatory body in the future. If that occurs, we cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean-up costs. There is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liabilities on all potentially responsible parties.\nWe cannot be sure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations intended to protect the environment will not be adopted or become applicable to us. Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe have a net deferred tax asset of $7.8 million and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize a significant portion of this net deferred tax asset, which could lead to a write-down (or even a loss) of the net deferred tax asset and adversely affect our operating results and financial position.\nWe recorded a net deferred tax asset as the result of our acquisitions of Frontier Natural Gas and Bangor Gas Company in 2007. This tax asset was $7.8 million at December 31, 2014. We may continue to depreciate approximately $81.7 million of Frontier and Bangor\u2019s capital assets using the useful lives and rates employed by those companies, resulting in future potential federal and state income tax benefits over a 20-year period using applicable Federal and state income tax rates. Under Internal Revenue Code Section 382, our ability to recognize tax deductions as a result of this tax benefit was limited during the first five years following the acquisitions.\nManagement will reevaluate the valuation allowance each year on completion of updated estimates of taxable income for future periods, and will reduce the deferred tax asset by the new valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the recognized deferred tax assets. In addition, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the $7.8 million net deferred tax asset over the remaining useful life of the asset. A write down in the deferred tax asset or expiration of the asset before it is utilized would adversely affect our operating results and financial position.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 contains provisions requiring us to assess the effectiveness of internal control for financial reporting, as well as attestation and reporting by independent auditors on our internal control over financial reporting as well as other control-related matters.\nCompliance with Section 404 is both costly and challenging. There is a risk that we will not be able to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404 because of the discovery of material weaknesses. Further, during the course of our testing we may identify deficiencies that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadlines imposed under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for compliance with Section 404. Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our stock could be adversely affected.\nOur actual results of operations could differ from estimates used to prepare our financial statements.\nIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, our management often must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider the regulatory accounting policy to be our most critical because of the uncertainties, judgments, and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved. Regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators to be reflected in the financial statements. Their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the assets will be written off as a charge in current period earnings.\nOur Company\u2019s operations could give rise to risk in cybersecurity attacks.\nOn October 13, 2011, the SEC\u2019s Division of Corporation Finance issued Topic No. 2, Cybersecurity, relating to cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents. We rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, maintain information and manage our business. Disruptions in our computer systems could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales and the interruption of operations.\nFailure to effectively implement our new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nIn 2014, we began the implementation of a new ERP system that will integrate our business processes and we believe that it will improve our overall operations. This new system will require a large amount of our capital and other resources. Failure to properly implement this new ERP system in a timely manner or at all could disrupt our operations and significantly increase our costs.\nRisks Related To Our Acquisition Strategy\nWe face a variety of risks associated with acquiring and integrating new business operations.\nThe growth and success of our business will depend to a great extent on our ability to acquire new assets or business operations and to integrate the operations of businesses that we have recently acquired as well as those that we may acquire in the future. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to:\n\u00b7 identify suitable acquisition candidates or opportunities,\n\u00b7 detect all actual and potential problems that may exist in the operations or financial condition of an acquisition candidate,\n\u00b7 acquire assets or business operations on commercially acceptable terms,\n\u00b7 effectively integrate the operations of any acquired assets or businesses with our existing operations,\n\u00b7 manage effectively the combined operations of the acquired businesses,\n\u00b7 achieve our operating and growth strategies with respect to the acquired assets or businesses,\n\u00b7 reduce our overall selling, general, and administrative expenses associated with the acquired assets or businesses, or\n\u00b7 comply with the internal control requirements of Section 404 as a result of an acquisition.\nThe integration of the management, personnel, operations, products, services, technologies, and facilities of any businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future could involve unforeseen difficulties. These difficulties could disrupt our ongoing businesses, distract our management and employees, and increase our expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nTo the extent we are successful in making an acquisition, we may face a number of related risks.\nAny acquisition may involve a number of risks, including the assumption of material liabilities, the terms and conditions of any state or federal regulatory approvals required for an acquisition, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from the management of daily operations to the integration of acquired operations, difficulties in the integration and retention of employees and difficulties in the integration of different cultures and practices, as well as in the integration of broad and geographically dispersed personnel and operations. The failure to make and integrate acquisitions successfully could have an adverse effect on our ability to grow our business.\nSubsequent to the consummation of an acquisition, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment charges or other charges that could have a significant negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and our stock price.\nThere could be material issues present inside a particular target business that are not uncovered in the course of due diligence performed prior to the acquisition, and there could be factors outside of the target business and outside of our control that later arise. As a result of these factors, after an acquisition is completed, we may be forced to write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations or incur impairment or other charges relating to an evaluation of goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets that could result in our reporting losses. In some acquisitions, goodwill is a significant portion of the purchase price, increasing the losses we would incur if such write-downs or write-offs occurred. In addition, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis.\nRisks Related To Our Common Stock\nFuture issuances of our common stock may dilute the interests of existing shareholders.\nWe have issued shares of our common stock and may issue additional shares of our common stock to finance acquisitions and in connection with equity offerings. For example, in 2013 we consummated a transaction to purchase the assets of JDOG Marketing. The initial purchase price was paid in shares of our common stock and we will issue additional earn-out shares if the acquired business achieves certain financial milestones. The issuance of any additional shares may result in economic dilution to our existing shareholders.\nOur ability to pay dividends on our common stock is limited.\nWe cannot assure that we will continue to pay dividends at our current dividend rate or at all. In particular, our ability to pay dividends in the future will depend upon, among other things, our future earnings, cash requirements, state ring fencing provisions, and covenants under our existing credit facilities and any future credit agreements to which we may be a party. In addition, acquisitions funded by the issuance of our common stock or future issuances to raise capital will increase the number of our shares outstanding and may make it more difficult to continue paying dividends at our current rate.\nFinancial covenants contained in our credit facilities place constraints on our business and may adversely affect our growth, business, earnings, cash flow, liquidity, and financial condition. Our failure to comply with any of these covenants may result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of the debt under the credit facilities or other agreements we may enter into from time to time that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. If this occurs, there can be no assurance that we would be able to refinance or otherwise repay such indebtedness, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, earnings, cash flow, liquidity and financial condition.\nThe possible issuance of future series of preferred stock could adversely affect the holders of our common stock.\nPursuant to our articles of incorporation, our board of directors has the authority to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of unissued preferred stock and to issue those shares without any further action or vote by the shareholders. The rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. These adverse effects could include subordination to preferred shareholders in the payment of dividends and upon our liquidation and dissolution, and the use of preferred stock as an anti-takeover measure, which could impede a change in control that is otherwise in the interests of holders of our common stock.\nOur charter documents and Ohio law, as well as certain utility laws and regulations, may discourage a third party from attempting to acquire us by means of a tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, which could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation and code of regulations and state utility laws and regulations, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders. For example, our charter documents do not permit cumulative voting, allow the removal of directors only for cause, and establish certain advance notice procedures for nomination of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered at shareholders\u2019 meetings. Additionally, Ohio corporate law provides that certain notice and informational filings and special shareholder meeting and voting procedures must be followed prior to consummation of a proposed \u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d as defined in the Ohio Revised Code. Assuming compliance with the prescribed notice and information filings, a proposed control share acquisition may be made only if, at a meeting of shareholders, the acquisition is approved by both a majority of our shares and a majority of the voting shares remaining after excluding the combined voting of the \u201cinterested shares,\u201d as defined in the Ohio Revised Code. Some takeover attempts may even be subject to approval by the Ohio Division of Securities or the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. The application of these provisions may inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe value of our common stock may decline significantly if we do not maintain our listing on the NYSE MKT Equities stock exchange.\nIn addition to federal and state regulation of our utility operations and regulation by the SEC, we are subject to the listing requirements of NYSE MKT. The NYSE MKT rules contain requirements with respect to corporate governance, communications with shareholders, the trading price of shares of our common stock, and various other matters. We believe we are in compliance with NYSE MKT listing requirements, but there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet those listing requirements in the future. If we fail to comply with listing requirements, the NYSE MKT could de-list our stock. If our stock was de-listed from NYSE MKT, our shares would likely trade in the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board, but the ability of our shareholders to sell our stock could be impaired because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and security analysts\u2019 coverage of the Company may be reduced. Further, because of the additional regulatory burdens imposed upon broker-dealers with respect to de-listed companies, delisting could discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our stock, further limiting the liquidity of our shares. These factors could have a material adverse effect on the trading price, liquidity, value and marketability of our stock.\nOrganization, Structure and Management Risks\nOur credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that may reduce our flexibility, and adversely affect our business, earnings, cash flow, liquidity and financial condition.\nThe terms of our credit facilities impose significant restrictions on our ability and, in some cases, the ability of our subsidiaries, to take a number of actions that we may otherwise desire to take, including:\n\u00b7 requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital, capital expenditures and other business activities,\n\u00b7 requiring us to meet certain financial tests, which may affect our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate,\n\u00b7 limiting our ability to sell assets, make investments in or acquire assets of, or merge or consolidate with, other companies,\n\u00b7 limiting our ability to repurchase or redeem our stock or enter into transactions with our shareholders or affiliates, and\n\u00b7 limiting our ability to grant liens, incur additional indebtedness or contingent obligations or obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other activities.\nOur credit facility with Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada requires us to maintain debt service reserve accounts of $948,137 to cover approximately one year of interest payments. We are not able to use these funds for operational cash purposes. The terms allow us to withdraw the funds if a letter of credit is received to replace the restricted cash.\nThese covenants place constraints on our business and may adversely affect our growth, business, earnings, cash flow, liquidity, and financial condition. Our failure to comply with any of the financial covenants in the credit facilities may result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of the debt under the credit facilities or other agreements we may enter into from time to time that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. If this occurs, there can be no assurance that we would be able to refinance or otherwise repay such indebtedness, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, earnings, cash flow, liquidity and financial condition.\nOur primary assets are our operating subsidiaries, and there are limits on our ability to obtain revenue from those subsidiaries, which may limit our ability to pay dividends to shareholders.\nWe are a holding company with no direct operations and our principal assets are the equity securities of our subsidiary utilities. We rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for our cash flows, thus our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders and finance acquisitions depends on the ability of our subsidiaries to generate sufficient net income and cash flows to pay upstream dividends to us. Further, our subsidiaries are legally distinct from us, and although they are wholly-owned and controlled by us, our ability to obtain distributions from them by way of dividends, interest or other payments (including intercompany loans) is subject to restrictions imposed by their term loans and credit facilities (under which they are borrowers and we are a guarantor). For example:\n\u00b7 we may cause our Maine, Montana, and North Carolina operating subsidiaries to pay a dividend only if the dividend, when combined with dividends over the previous five years, would not exceed 80% of their net income over those years,\n\u00b7 we may cause our Ohio and Pennsylvania subsidiaries to distribute dividends only if the aggregate amount of all such dividends and any distributions, redemptions and repurchases for the trailing twelve month period do not exceed 70% of their net income for that same period.\nAdditionally, the Montana and Wyoming Public Service Commissions have imposed ring-fencing restrictions on distributions from Energy West and its Montana, Maine, and North Carolina subsidiaries to Gas Natural. The most restrictive of these provisions arose from the November 25, 2014 MPSC Order regarding the temporary increase to our BOA line of credit which restricts the payment of dividends from Energy West and its Montana, Maine, and North Carolina subsidiaries to Gas Natural.\nThese dividend restrictions, in addition to other financial covenants contained in the credit facilities and ring-fencing restrictions, place constraints on our business and may adversely affect our cash flow, liquidity and financial condition as well as our ability to finance acquisitions or pay dividends. Further, we may be required to comply with additional covenants. Failure to comply with financial covenants may result in the acceleration of the debt and foreclosure of our assets, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, earnings, cash flow, liquidity and financial condition. For further details on the financial covenants contained in the credit facilities, see the \u201cRestrictions on Dividends\u201d subsection of Note 18 - Stockholders\u2019 Equity in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nThe Wyoming Public Service Commission has asserted jurisdiction over Gas Natural\u2019s activities, which could hinder, delay or prevent us from pursuing acquisitions and other transactions that are important to our short term and long term financial condition and growth.\nWe obtained the approval of the WPSC for our holding company reorganization in October 2008, but subsequently in connection with our acquisition of the Ohio operations, the WPSC issued an order, affirmed on rehearing issued in November 2011, holding us subject to its general jurisdiction over public utilities. In December 2011, we timely filed a Petition for Review of the WPSC order in the Laramie County, Wyoming District Court. On October 9, 2012, the District Court reversed the WPSC's finding of jurisdiction and remanded to the WPSC for additional findings. A hearing was conducted by the WPSC on April 3 and 4, 2013. To date, the WPSC has not issued a final order in this matter. If, following the hearing, the WPSC affirms that it has jurisdiction over us with respect to any potential acquisition, refinancing of debt or other significant transaction and denies a request by us for exemption with respect to the transaction, it could delay, hinder or prevent us from completing the transaction, negatively impacting our financial condition, results of operations, and growth. In October 2014, we entered into a transaction to sell the stock of EWW which requires the approval of the WPSC. Once the WPSC approves the sale of EWW and the transaction is completed, we will no longer have any operations in Wyoming and the WPSC will no longer hold general jurisdiction over our operations. Until the jurisdictional issue is resolved or the sale of EWW is finalized, the WPSC continues to assert jurisdiction over the holding company.\nOur performance depends substantially on the performance of our executive officers and other key personnel and the ability of our management team to fully implement our business strategy.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to attract, train, retain, and motivate high quality personnel, especially highly qualified managerial personnel. Poor execution in the performance of our management team or the loss of services of key executive officers or personnel could impair our ability to successfully operate the Company and to acquire and integrate new business operations, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have entered into a limited liability operating agreement with third parties to develop and operate oil, gas and mineral leasehold estates, which exposes us to the risk associated with oil, gas and mineral exploration as well as the risks inherent in relying upon third parties in business ventures and we may enter into similar agreements in the future.\nWe depend upon the performance of third party participants in endeavors such as Kykuit Resources LLC, and their performance of their obligations to us are outside our control. If these parties do not meet or satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, the performance and success of endeavors such as Kykuit may be adversely affected. If third parties to operating agreements and similar agreements are unable to meet their obligations we may be forced to undertake the obligations ourselves or incur additional expenses in order to have some other party perform such obligations. We may also be required to enforce our rights that may cause disputes among third parties and us. If any of these events occur, they may adversely impact us, our financial performance and results of operations.\nWe have entered into transactions with related parties, and shareholders and potential investors in Gas Natural may not value these transactions in the same manner as those with unrelated parties.\nWe have entered into agreements and transactions with Richard M. Osborne, father of the Company\u2019s chief executive officer and the Company\u2019s former chairman and chief executive officer. In the future we will continue to perform as required under these agreements until they expire and alternative sources are found to replace the services provided.
