Risk Factors\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information contained in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may materially affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. If any of these risks occur, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nBecause we have a short operating history in an evolving industry, our past results may not be indicative of future performance, and our future performance may fluctuate materially and increase your investment risk.\nWe have a short operating history in a rapidly evolving industry that may not develop as expected, if at all. Our relatively short operating history makes it difficult to assess our future prospects. You should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we may encounter.\nOur future success will depend in large part upon our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\ncost effectively acquire new customers who purchase products from us at the same rate and of the same type as existing customers;\n\u2022\nretain our existing customers and have them continue to purchase products from us at rates and methods consistent with their prior purchasing behavior;\n\u2022\nencourage customers to expand the categories of products they purchase from us;\n\u2022\nattract new vendors and retain our existing vendors to supply quality products that we can offer to our customers at attractive prices;\n\u2022\nincrease the awareness of our brand;\n\u2022\nprovide our customers and vendors with a superior experience;\n\u2022\nfulfill and deliver orders in a timely way and in accordance with customer expectations, which may change over time;\n\u2022\nrespond to changes in consumer access to and use of the Internet and mobile devices;\n\u2022\ndeliver email and mobile alerts to our subscribers successfully;\n\u2022\nreact to challenges from existing and new competitors;\n\u2022\nexpand our business in new and existing markets, both domestic and international;\n\u2022\navoid interruptions or disruptions in our business;\n\u2022\ndevelop a scalable, high-performance technology and fulfillment infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably handle increased usage globally, as well as the deployment of new features and the sale of new products and services;\n\u2022\nrespond to macroeconomic trends;\n\u2022\nhire, integrate and retain talented merchandise buyers and other personnel; and\n\u2022\neffectively manage rapid growth in our personnel and operations.\nWe experience seasonal trends in our business, and our mix of product offerings is highly variable from day-to-day and quarter-to-quarter. This variability makes it difficult to predict sales and can result in significant fluctuations in our net sales from period-to-period. We base our expense levels and investment plans on our estimates of net sales and gross margins. A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we may be unable to adjust our spending quickly if our net sales or our gross margins are worse than expected.\nThe cumulative effects of these factors or our inability to manage any of the risks and difficulties identified above and elsewhere in this section could result in large fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual operating results. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. This variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our net sales or operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may provide to the market, or if the forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our Class A common stock could decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could occur even when we have met any previously publicly stated net sales or earnings forecasts that we may provide.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nTo effectively manage our growth, we must continue to implement our operational plans and strategies, improve and expand our infrastructure of people and information systems and expand, train and manage our employee and contractor base. We have rapidly increased employee and contractor headcount since our inception to support the growth in our business, and we intend for this growth to continue for the foreseeable future. The number of our employees increased from 329 as of January 1, 2012 to 2,907 as of December 28, 2014, and we expect to add a number of employees during 2015. To support continued growth, we must effectively integrate, develop and motivate a large number of new employees, while maintaining our corporate culture. In particular, we intend to continue to make substantial investments to expand our merchandising and technology personnel. We face significant competition for personnel, particularly in the Seattle area where our headquarters is located. To\nattract top talent, we have had to offer, and believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages before we can validate the productivity of those employees. Additionally, we may not be able to hire new employees quickly enough to meet our needs. If we fail to effectively manage our hiring needs or successfully integrate our new hires, our efficiency and ability to meet our forecasts and our employee morale, productivity and retention could suffer, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAdditionally, the growth and expansion of our business and our product offerings place significant demands on our management and mid-level management in particular. We produce new versions of our sites and emails and mobile alerts to our customers on a daily basis, which generally requires new products, photos and text every day. The growth of our business may require significant additional resources to meet these daily requirements, which may not scale in a cost-effective manner or may negatively affect the quality of our sites and customer experience. We are also required to manage multiple relationships with various vendors, customers and other third parties. If we fail to manage these third-party relationships or any business developments effectively, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. Further growth of our operations, our vendor base, our fulfillment centers, information technology systems or our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support our operations. If we are unable to manage the growth of our organization effectively, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses in the past, and we may not be able to generate sufficient net sales to achieve or maintain profitability. Our recent net sales growth may not be sustainable, and a failure to maintain an adequate growth rate will materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWhile we achieved profitability on an annual basis for each of the fiscal years ended December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013, we incurred net losses of $10.3 million and $11.3 million in the fiscal years ended December 30, 2012 and January 1, 2012, respectively, and had an accumulated deficit of $30.2 million as of December 28, 2014. We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we continue to invest to increase our customer base, increase the number and variety of products we offer, expand our marketing channels, expand our operations, hire additional employees and managers, incur the costs of being a public company and develop our technology platform and fulfillment infrastructure. These efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate. Although our net sales have grown rapidly, increasing from $695.7 million in the fiscal year ended December 29, 2013 to $1.2 billion in the fiscal year ended December 28, 2014, we may not be able to sustain this rate of net sales growth or to increase our net sales sufficiently to offset higher expenses. Some of our efforts to generate net sales from our business are new and unproven, and any failure to increase our net sales or improve our gross margins could prevent us from maintaining or increasing profitability. In addition, we expect to invest to fund longer term initiatives, which will likely impact profitability or other operating results. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. If we are unable to effectively manage these risks and difficulties as we encounter them, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to accurately forecast net sales and appropriately plan our expenses in the future.\nWe may base our current and future expense levels on our operating forecasts and estimates of future net sales and gross margins. Net sales and operating results are difficult to forecast because they generally depend on the volume, timing and type of the orders we receive, as well as the rate of customer activation and repeat customer behavior, all of which are uncertain. Additionally, our business is affected by general economic and business conditions in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland and other international markets. A significant portion of our expenses is fixed, and as a result, we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in net sales. Any failure to accurately predict net sales or gross margins could cause our operating results in any given quarter, or a series of quarters, to be lower than expected, which could cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline substantially.\nOur business is highly competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.\nWe expect competition in e-commerce generally, and with companies employing a flash sales model in particular, to continue to increase because there are no significant barriers to entry. We currently compete with and expect to increasingly compete with e-commerce businesses, such as Amazon.com, Inc. and Alibaba Group, the e-commerce platforms of traditional retailers, such as Target Corporation, Toys\u201cR\u201dUs, Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,\nand online marketplaces such as eBay Inc., particularly as some of these companies adopt flash sales business practices. A substantial number of flash sales sites have similar business models in related and unrelated market segments, including Gilt Groupe Holdings, Inc., Groupon, Inc., HauteLook (which is owned by Nordstrom, Inc.), MyHabit (which is operated by Amazon.com), One Kings Lane, Inc., RueLaLa.com (which is operated by Retail Convergence.com LP) and Wayfair LLC. We also compete with the traditional offline retail industry, including discount and mass merchandisers, such as Ross Stores, Inc., Target, The TJX Companies, Inc., Toys\u201cR\u201dUs and Walmart, as well as boutique sellers of women's, children\u2019s and men's apparel, children's merchandise and other product categories such as kitchen accessories and home d\u00e9cor.\nWe believe that our ability to compete depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe size of the online retail market;\n\u2022\nthe size and composition of our customer base and vendor base;\n\u2022\nthe number of vendors and products we feature on our sites;\n\u2022\nselling and marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nthe quality, price and reliability of products offered either by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe convenience and entertainment of the shopping experience that we provide;\n\u2022\nour ability to cost-effectively source, market and distribute our products and manage our operations; and\n\u2022\nour reputation and brand strength relative to our competitors.\nMany of our current competitors have, and potential competitors may have, longer operating histories, larger fulfillment infrastructures, greater technical capabilities, significantly faster shipping times as well as free or low-cost shipping, significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources and larger customer bases than we do. These factors may allow our competitors to derive greater net sales and profits from their existing customer base, acquire customers at lower costs, use incentive programs to acquire our customers, or respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in consumer habits. These competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns and adopt more aggressive pricing policies, which may allow them to build larger customer bases or generate net sales from their customer bases more effectively than we do.\nWe depend on the continued growth of e-commerce in general and the flash sales model in particular.\nThe business of selling products over the Internet, particularly on the flash sales model, is dynamic and relatively new. The market segment for the flash sales model has grown significantly, and this growth may not be sustainable. If customers cease to find the flash sales model shopping experience fun, entertaining and a good value, or otherwise lose interest in shopping in this manner, we may not acquire new customers at rates consistent with historical or projected periods, and existing customers\u2019 buying patterns and levels may be less than historical or projected rates. If the market segment for the flash sales model were to become saturated or decline overall, we may not be able to acquire new customers or engage existing customers, and our business, financial condition and operating results may suffer.\nIf we fail to acquire new customers or engage existing customers, we may not be able to increase net sales or maintain profitability.\nWe have made significant investments related to customer acquisition and expect to continue to spend significant amounts to acquire additional customers. We must continue to acquire customers and engage existing customers in order to increase net sales and maintain profitability. In order to expand our customer base, we must appeal to and acquire customers who have historically used other means of commerce to purchase products and may prefer alternatives to our offerings, such as in-store, the retailer\u2019s own website or the websites of our competitors. In the United States, where we have achieved some level of market penetration, acquiring new customers may become more difficult and costly than it has been in the past. For example, in the fiscal year ended December 28, 2014, we saw an increase in customer acquisition costs compared to the prior year. We cannot assure you that the net sales from new customers we acquire will ultimately exceed the cost of acquiring those customers. If we fail to deliver an entertaining shopping experience, or if consumers do not perceive the products we offer to be of high value and quality or deliverable within a reasonable period of time, we may not be able to\nacquire new customers or engage existing customers. If we are unable to acquire new customers who purchase products in numbers sufficient to grow our business or consistent with previously acquired customers, or engage our existing customers, the net sales we generate may decrease, and our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe believe that many of our new customers originate from word-of-mouth and other non-paid referrals from existing customers, and therefore we must ensure that our existing customers remain loyal to us in order to continue receiving those referrals. If our efforts to satisfy our existing customers are not successful, we may not be able to acquire new customers in sufficient numbers to continue to grow our business, or we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenses in order to acquire new customers. If the level of usage by our customer base declines or does not grow as expected, we may suffer a decline in customer retention or growth or net sales. A significant decrease in the level of usage or current or anticipated customer growth would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe have relationships with social networking sites, such as Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter and Tumblr, online services, search engines, affiliate marketing websites, directories and other websites and e-commerce businesses to provide advertising and other links that direct customers to our sites. As e-commerce and social networking continue to rapidly evolve, we must continue to establish relationships with the channels that are used by our current and prospective customers and cost-effectively drive traffic to our sites. We rely on these relationships as significant sources of traffic to our sites and to generate new customers. If we are unable to develop or maintain these relationships on acceptable terms, our ability to attract new customers, engage existing customers and our financial condition would suffer.\nWe also conduct television branding and advertising campaigns. Such campaigns are expensive and may not result in the cost-effective acquisition of customers.\nWe base our decisions regarding expenditures in customer acquisition primarily on our analysis of the net sales generated from customers that we acquired in prior periods. Our estimates and assumptions may not accurately reflect our future results, and we may not be able to recover our customer acquisition costs.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract customers in a cost-effective manner. Our decisions regarding investments in customer acquisition substantially depend upon our analysis of the net sales generated from customers we acquired in earlier periods. Our analysis regarding customer acquisition investment and net sales includes several assumptions, such as:\n\u2022\nMany customers sign-up as subscribers to our sites for varying periods of time before they make their first purchase and become active customers. We make various assumptions with respect to the level of additional marketing or other expenses necessary to activate these subscribers and how these expenses vary from those required to generate subscriptions. If our assumptions regarding such expenses are incorrect, our net sales relative to customer acquisition cost could be less favorable than we believe.\n\u2022\nWe make various assumptions based on our historical data with respect to the repurchase rates of active customers. If our assumptions regarding such repurchase rates are incorrect, our net sales relative to customer acquisition cost could be less favorable than we believe.\nIf our assumptions regarding our customer acquisition investment and resulting net sales from these customers, including those relating to the effectiveness of our marketing expenditures, prove incorrect, our ability to generate net sales from our investments in new customer acquisitions may be less than we have assumed and have experienced in the past. In such case, we may need to increase expenses or otherwise alter our strategy, and our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur sales may be adversely affected if we fail to respond to changes in consumer preferences in a timely manner or are not successful in expanding our product offerings.\nOur financial performance depends on our ability to identify, originate and define retail product trends, as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner. Our products must appeal to a broad range of moms and other consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. Our business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences dictated in part by retail product trends, perceived product value and seasonal variations.\nWe have broadened our product offering beyond children's apparel, to include women\u2019s apparel, toys, infant gear, men's apparel, kitchen accessories, home d\u00e9cor and other categories. We continue to explore additional categories which may be accepted by our target customers. If we offer new products or categories that are not accepted by our customers or that adversely impact the customer experience, our sales may fall short of expectations, our brand and reputation could be adversely affected and we may incur expenses that are not offset by sales. If we expand into new categories, consumer demands may be different, and there is no assurance that the flash sales model will be successful in these new categories. We may make substantial investments in such new categories in anticipation of future net sales. If the launch of a new category requires investments greater than we expect, if we are unable to attract vendors that produce sufficient high quality, value-oriented products or if the sales generated from a new category grow more slowly or produce lower gross margins than we expect, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. Expansion of our product lines may also strain our management and operational resources, specifically the need to hire and manage additional merchandise buyers to source and curate these new products. We may also face greater competition in specific categories from Internet sites that are more focused on such categories. It may be difficult to differentiate our offering from other competitors as we offer additional product categories, and our customers may have additional considerations in deciding whether or not to purchase these additional product categories. In addition, the relative profitability, if any, of new product lines may be lower than what we have experienced historically, and we may not generate sufficient net sales from new product initiatives to recoup our investments in them. If any of these were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur business relies heavily on email and mobile \"push\" notifications, and any restrictions on the sending of emails or mobile alerts or an inability to timely deliver such communications could adversely affect our net sales and business.\nOur business is highly dependent upon email and mobile \"push\" notifications for promoting our sites and products. We provide daily emails and mobile alerts to subscribers informing them of what is available for purchase on our sites that day, and we believe these emails and mobile alerts are an important part of our customer experience and help generate a substantial portion of our net sales. If we are unable to successfully deliver emails or mobile alerts to our subscribers, or if subscribers decline to open our emails or mobile alerts, our net sales and profitability would be adversely affected. For example, our net sales growth in fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013 was partially constrained by email deliverability issues with some of our email subscribers during the third quarter of 2014 and our cautious stance regarding email marketing in the fourth quarter of 2014 in order to prevent any future email deliverability issues. Changes in how webmail application providers such as Google Inc., Yahoo! Inc., Microsoft Corporation, AOL Inc. and Comcast Corporation organize, prioritize, filter and deliver email may reduce the number of subscribers opening our emails. For example, Google Inc.\u2019s Gmail service contains features that organize incoming emails into categories (such as primary, social, promotions, updates and spam). Such categorization or similar inbox organizational features or filtering by Google Inc. and other webmail application providers may result in our emails being delivered in a less prominent location in a subscriber\u2019s inbox or viewed as \u201cspam\u201d by our subscribers and may reduce the likelihood of that subscriber opening our emails. Actions by third parties such as platform providers Apple App Store or Google Play Store to block, impose restrictions on or charge for the delivery of emails or mobile alerts could also materially and adversely impact our business. From time to time, Internet service providers, webmail applications or other third parties may block bulk email transmissions or otherwise experience technical difficulties that result in our inability to successfully deliver emails or mobile alerts to third parties or our subscribers. Changes in laws, regulations or third-party provider policies that limit our ability to send such communications or impose additional requirements upon us or our subscribers in connection with sending such communications would also materially and adversely impact our business. Our use of email and mobile alerts to send communications about our sites or other matters may also result in legal claims against us, which may cause us increased expenses, and if successful might result in fines and orders with costly reporting and compliance obligations or might limit or prohibit our ability to send emails or mobile alerts. We also rely on social networking messaging services to send communications and to encourage customers to send communications. Changes to the terms of these social networking services to limit promotional communications, any restrictions that would limit our ability or our customers\u2019 ability to send communications through their services, disruptions or downtime experienced by these social networking services or decline in the use of or engagement with social networking services by customers and potential customers could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe rely on a third-party service for the delivery of all our daily emails, and delay or errors in the delivery of such emails or other messaging we send may occur and are beyond our control. For example, the delivery of our daily emails to subscribers has previously been delayed by two hours as a result of a third-party service error. We\nhave also experienced technical issues that have resulted in shorter delivery delays of our daily emails to subscribers. Such delays could occur again in the future or be more severe, which could result in damage to our reputation or harm our business, financial condition and operating results. If we were unable to use our current email service or other messaging services, alternate services are available; however, we believe our sales could be impacted for some period as we transition to a new provider. Any disruption or restriction on the distribution of our emails or other messages, termination or disruption of our relationship with our messaging service providers, including our third-party service that delivers our daily emails, or any increase in our costs associated with our email and other messaging activities could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nCustomer growth and activity on mobile devices depends upon effective use of mobile operating systems, networks and standards that we do not control.\nPurchases using mobile devices by consumers generally, and by our customers specifically, have increased significantly, and we expect this trend to continue. To optimize the mobile shopping experience, we are somewhat dependent on our customers downloading our specific mobile applications for their particular device as opposed to accessing our sites from an Internet browser on their mobile device. As new mobile devices and platforms are released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing applications for these alternative devices and platforms, and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support and maintenance of such applications. In addition, our future growth and our results of operations could suffer if we experience difficulties in the future in integrating our mobile applications into mobile devices or if problems arise with our relationships with providers of mobile operating systems or mobile application download stores, such as those of Apple Inc. or Google Inc., if our applications receive unfavorable treatment compared to competing applications, such as the order of our products in the Apple App Store, or if we face increased costs to distribute or have customers use our mobile app. We are further dependent on the interoperability of our sites with popular mobile operating systems that we do not control, such as iOS and Android, and any changes in such systems that degrade the functionality of our sites, block or impose restrictions on our delivery of mobile alerts or give preferential treatment to competitive products could adversely affect the usage of our sites on mobile devices. In the event that it is more difficult for our customers to access and use our sites on their mobile devices, or if our customers choose not to access or to use our sites on their mobile devices or to use mobile products that do not offer access to our sites, our customer growth could be harmed and our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur failure or the failure of third-party service providers to protect our sites, networks and systems against security breaches, or otherwise to protect our confidential information or the confidential information of our customers, could damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business and operating results.\nOur business employs sites, networks and systems through which we collect, maintain, transmit and store data about our customers, vendors and others, including credit card information and personally identifiable information, as well as other confidential and proprietary information. We also employ third-party service providers that store, process and transmit proprietary, personal and confidential information on our behalf. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties in an effort to securely transmit confidential and sensitive information, including credit card numbers. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries or other developments may result in the whole or partial failure of this technology to protect transaction data or other confidential and sensitive information from being breached or compromised. More generally, we take steps to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of the information we collect, store or transmit, but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts. Our security measures, and those of our third-party service providers, may not detect or prevent all attempts to hack our systems, denial-of-service attacks, viruses, malicious software, break-ins, phishing attacks, social engineering, security breaches or other attacks and similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information stored in or transmitted by our sites, networks and systems or that we or our third-party service providers otherwise maintain. We and our service providers may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent all types of attacks, and techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our third-party service providers. In addition, security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships.\nBreaches of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers or cyber security incidents could result in unauthorized access to our sites, networks and systems; unauthorized access to and misappropriation of consumer information, including consumers\u2019 personally identifiable information, or other confidential or proprietary information of ourselves or third parties; viruses, worms, spyware or other malware being served from our sites, networks or systems; deletion or modification of content or the display of unauthorized content on our sites; interruption, disruption or malfunction of operations; costs relating to breach remediation, deployment of additional personnel and protection technologies, response to governmental investigations and media inquiries and coverage; engagement of third party experts and consultants; and litigation, regulatory action and other potential liabilities. If any of these breaches of security occur, our reputation and brand could be damaged, our business may suffer, we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to alleviate problems caused by such breaches and we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation or regulatory action and possible liability. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees and engage third-party experts and consultants. In addition, any party who is able to illicitly obtain a subscriber\u2019s password could access the subscriber\u2019s transaction data or personal information. Any compromise or breach of our security measures, or those of our third-party service providers, could violate applicable privacy, data security and other laws, and cause significant legal and financial exposure, adverse publicity and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse and material effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Although we maintain privacy, data breach and network security liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. We may need to devote significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches, diverting resources from the growth and expansion of our business.\nOur business depends on a strong brand. We may not be able to maintain and enhance our brand, or we may receive unfavorable customer complaints or negative publicity, which could adversely affect our brand.\nWe believe that the brand we have built with our customers has significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing the \u201czulily\u201d brand is critical to expanding our base of customers and vendors. Maintaining and enhancing our brand may require us to make substantial investments, and these investments may not be successful. If we fail to promote and maintain the \u201czulily\u201d brand or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. We anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly competitive, maintaining and enhancing our brand may become increasingly difficult and expensive. Maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide reliable, trustworthy and high quality products that are timely delivered to our customers and a reliable, trustworthy and profitable market to our vendors, which we may not do successfully.\nOur brand depends on effective customer support, which requires significant personnel expense. If not managed properly, this expense could impact our profitability. Failure to manage or train our own or outsourced customer support representatives properly could compromise our ability to handle customer complaints effectively.\nCustomer complaints or negative publicity about our sites, products, product delivery times, customer data handling and security practices or customer support, especially on social media platforms such as blogs and social media websites, could rapidly and severely diminish consumer use of our sites and consumer and vendor confidence in us and cause our reputation to suffer.\nIf we do not successfully optimize and operate our fulfillment centers, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nIf we do not optimize and operate our fulfillment centers successfully and efficiently, it could result in excess or insufficient fulfillment capacity, an increase in costs or impairment charges or harm our business in other ways. If we do not have sufficient fulfillment capacity or experience a problem fulfilling orders in a timely manner, our customers may experience delays in receiving their purchases, which could harm our reputation and our relationship with our customers.\nWe have designed and built our own fulfillment center infrastructure, including customizing third-party inventory and package handling software systems, which is tailored to meet the specific needs of our business. As we continue to add fulfillment and warehouse volumes and capabilities, add new businesses or categories with different fulfillment requirements or change the mix in products that we sell, our fulfillment network will become\nincreasingly complex and operating it will become more challenging. For example, in our prior outsourced third-party fulfillment center, operational difficulties were encountered as our shipping volumes increased dramatically, which resulted in shipping delays and customer dissatisfaction. Failure to successfully address such challenges in a cost-effective and timely manner could impair our ability to timely deliver our customers\u2019 purchases and could harm our reputation and ultimately, our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may not successfully expand our fulfillment center capacity in a timely and cost-effective manner to address future growth, which could delay our shipping times and our business, reputation and operating results could be harmed.\nOur current fulfillment center network has the capability to handle limited growth with the current mix of product offerings before additional capacity will be required. We commenced operations in a new Nevada fulfillment center in the third quarter of 2014. We also entered into a lease agreement for a new fulfillment center located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, which we expect to begin using in 2015. The expansion of our fulfillment center capacity will put pressure on our managerial, financial, operational, technology and other resources. We cannot assure you that we will effectively expand into the new Pennsylvania fulfillment center, that our customized inventory and package handling software systems meet our business needs, or that we will be able to execute on our expansion plans, or recruit qualified managerial and operational personnel necessary to support our expansion plans. If we are unable to expand our fulfillment operations, increase fulfillment center capacity or effectively control expansion-related expenses, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. If we grow faster than we anticipate, we may exceed our fulfillment center capacity sooner than we anticipate, we may experience problems fulfilling orders in a timely manner or our customers may experience delays in receiving their purchases, which could harm our reputation and our relationship with our customers, and we would need to increase our capital expenditures more than anticipated. Many of the expenses and investments with respect to our fulfillment centers are fixed, and any expansion of such fulfillment centers will require additional investment of capital. We may incur such expenses or make such investments in advance of expected sales, and such expected sales may not occur.\nOur failure to adequately and effectively staff our fulfillment centers, through third-parties or with our own employees, or to integrate employees as we are transitioning from our third-party staffing organizations, could adversely affect our shipping times, business and results of operations.\nWe depend, in part, on a third party to provide staffing for our U.S. fulfillment centers. As of December 28, 2014, there were over 1,400 third-party associates in our U.S. fulfillment centers. By using a third-party staffing organization, we face additional risks that are outside of our control, such as employment claims, issues arising from failure to comply with labor or other laws, union organizing activities and any deterioration in the finance and operations of such organization. If our third-party staffing organization is unable to adequately staff our fulfillment centers or if the cost of such staffing is higher than historical or projected costs due to mandated wage increases or other factors, our operations could be harmed. We depend on a third party to provide fulfillment services for some of our sales outside the United States, and we face similar risks with that third party.\nIn the second quarter of 2014, we began staffing our U.S. fulfillment centers, in part, with our employees, many of whom we hired from our third-party staffing organization. If we do not effectively integrate these employees into our U.S. fulfillment centers or transition staffing from the third-party staffing organization, or if the cost of such employees is higher than historical or projected costs due to mandated wage increases or other factors, our operations could be harmed. In addition, we will face potential risks that were previously addressed by our third-party staffing organization, such as employment claims, issues arising from failure to comply with labor or other laws or union organizing activities. Any such issues may result in delays in shipping times and our reputation, business and results of operations may be harmed.\nWe generally do not hold inventory until products have been ordered by customers, which results in slower delivery time than other e-commerce retailers.\nWe generally do not order inventory from our vendors to be held in our fulfillment centers until after the products have been ordered by our customers. As a result, the time from when an order is placed on our sites to when the product is delivered to our customers is longer than for many other e-commerce retailers who generally carry significant inventory that enables them to expedite delivery. Our average order-to-ship time from our U.S. fulfillment centers in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 13.7 days. In an effort to reduce order-to-ship times without carrying additional inventory, we have expanded consignment and fulfillment services for our vendors. We may not\nachieve our anticipated improvement in delivery times if we are unable to effectively deploy these services or engage a sufficient number of vendors to adopt these services. Our relatively slower delivery times may place us at a competitive disadvantage to other e-commerce retailers and may cause customers to stop purchasing from us. If we are required to decrease our delivery times to address this competition or to meet customer demands, we may be required to incur additional shipping costs, which we may or may not be able to pass on to our customers, or to change our operations to carry additional inventory and face additional inventory risk, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nUncertainties in global economic conditions and their impact on consumer spending patterns, particularly in the apparel, toys, infant gear, kitchen accessories and home d\u00e9cor categories, could adversely impact our operating results.\nOur performance is subject to global economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending worldwide, particularly spending on women's, children's and men's apparel, toys, infant gear, kitchen accessories and home d\u00e9cor. Some of the factors adversely affecting consumer spending include levels of unemployment, consumer debt levels, changes in net worth based on market changes and uncertainty, home foreclosures and changes in home values, fluctuating interest rates, credit availability, government actions, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty. Adverse economic changes in any of the regions in which we sell our products could reduce consumer confidence and could negatively affect net sales and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nFailure to continue to provide our customers with differentiated merchandise from vendors will harm our business.\nOur net sales growth depends, in part, on our ability to continue to source unique merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices from vendors. Offering a variety of brands, styles, categories and products at affordable price points is important to our ability to acquire new customers and to keep our existing customers engaged and purchasing products. Typically, our events feature thousands of product styles from different vendors and last for 72 hours, and we believe our business requires us to continue this rapid pace of product introduction. Growth in the number of our customers, as well as increased competition, may make it difficult to source additional brands and styles in sufficient quantities and on acceptable terms to meet the demand of our customers. Since launching our sites, we have purchased our merchandise from thousands of brands, with a particular focus on emerging brands and smaller boutique vendors. We believe our ability to offer our customers a high volume of merchandise from emerging brands and smaller boutique vendors is particularly important to our long-term success.\nWe have few contractual assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new products, and vendors could change the terms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selling to us for future sales at any time. As we grow, continuing to identify a sufficient number of new emerging brands and smaller boutique vendors may become more and more of a challenge. If we are not able to identify and effectively promote these new brands, we may lose customers to our competitors. Even if we identify new vendors, we may not be able to purchase desired merchandise in sufficient quantities on terms acceptable to us in the future, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive than those from existing vendors. In addition, larger national brands may offer products that are less unique, and it may be easier for our competitors to offer such products at prices or upon terms that may be compelling to consumers. An inability to purchase suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or to source new vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur merchandise approach and the flash sales model is challenging and, if not managed effectively, could adversely affect our operating results.\nTo support our large and diverse base of vendors and our flash sales model that requires constantly changing products, we must incur significant costs, including costs related to our merchandising team, photography studios and creative personnel. As our business grows, we may not be able to continue to expand our product offerings in a cost-effective manner. Expanding personnel in our merchandising and studio departments is challenging due to competition for such personnel, and expansion of our studio spaces may require fixed expenses and investments that will impact profitability and may not be recouped if sufficient additional net sales are not generated.\nIn addition, the variety in size and sophistication of our vendors presents different challenges to our infrastructure and operations. Our emerging brands and smaller boutique vendors may be less experienced in manufacturing and shipping, which in the past has led to inconsistencies in quality, delays in the delivery of merchandise or additional fulfillment cost. Our larger national brands may impose additional requirements on us or offer less favorable terms than our smaller vendors related to margins and inventory ownership and risk and may also be unable to ship products timely. If we are unable to maintain and effectively manage our relationships with our emerging brands and smaller boutique vendors or our larger national brands, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nFailure of our vendors to supply high quality and compliant merchandise in a timely manner may damage our reputation and brand and harm our business.\nWe depend on our vendors to supply high quality merchandise in a timely manner. The failure of our vendors to supply merchandise which meets our quality standards or the quality standards of our customers could damage our reputation and harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur vendors are subject to various risks, including raw material costs, inflation, labor disputes, union organizing activities, boycotts, financial liquidity, product merchantability, safety issues, inclement weather, natural disasters, disruptions in exports, trade restrictions, trade disruptions, currency fluctuations and general economic and political conditions that could limit the ability of our vendors to provide us with high quality merchandise on a timely basis and at prices and payment terms that are commercially acceptable. For these or other reasons, one or more of our vendors might not adhere to our vendor terms and conditions or their applicable contract or might stop providing us with high quality merchandise. If there are any deficiencies in the products our vendors have provided to us, we might not identify such deficiencies before products ship to our customers.\nIn addition, our vendors may have difficulty adjusting to our changing demands and growing business. As our business grows, our vendors will be required to provide us with a high volume of merchandise on a timely basis. Failure of our vendors to successfully address these increased volumes may result in shipping delays and customer dissatisfaction, which could harm our reputation and ultimately, our business, financial condition and operating results. Failure of our vendors to provide us with quality merchandise that complies with all applicable U.S. and international laws, including but not limited to product safety regulations and legislation, in a timely and effective manner could also damage our reputation and brand and could lead to an increase in customer litigation against us and an increase in our routine and non-routine litigation costs. Further, any merchandise could become subject to a recall, regulatory action or legal claim, which could result in increased legal expenses as well as damage to our reputation and brand and harm to our business. We cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our merchandise currently is manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the United States and other foreign governments, including the likelihood, type or effect of any such restrictions. Such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAny failure by our vendors to comply with product safety, labor or other laws, or our standard vendor terms and conditions or to provide safe factory conditions for their workers, may damage our reputation and brand and harm our business.\nMany of the products we sell on our sites are subject to regulation by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar state and international regulatory authorities. As a result, such products have been and could be in the future subject to recalls and other remedial actions. Many of the products we sell are for children, and these products are often subject to enhanced safety concerns and additional scrutiny and regulation. Product safety concerns may require us to voluntarily remove selected products from our sites. Such recalls and voluntary removal of products can result in, among other things, lost sales, diverted resources, potential harm to our reputation and increased customer service costs and legal expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nSome of the products we sell may expose us to product liability claims and litigation or regulatory action relating to personal injury, death or environmental or property damage. Although we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors may not indemnify us from product liability for a particular vendor\u2019s products, or our vendors may not have sufficient resources or insurance to satisfy their indemnity and defense obligations.\nWe purchase our merchandise from numerous vendors, including domestic and international manufacturers, resellers, wholesalers and consolidators. Our standard vendor terms and conditions require vendors to comply with applicable laws, as well as the intellectual property and proprietary rights of third parties. Failure of our vendors to comply with applicable laws, regulations and contractual requirements could lead to litigation against us, resulting in increased legal expenses and costs. In addition, the failure of any such vendors to provide safe and humane factory conditions and oversight at their facilities could damage our reputation with consumers or result in legal claims against us.\nWe may choose to expand or alter our operations by developing new sites or applications or by promoting new or complementary products, sales formats or services, which may increase our costs and may not be successful.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to expand or alter our operations in a cost-effective or timely manner or that any such efforts would be accepted by the market. Furthermore, any new business, website, application, product, promotion, sales format or service launched by us that is not favorably received by consumers could damage our reputation and brand. Any such expansion or alteration of our operations could also require significant additional expenses, management time and operations personnel that could impact our operating results. Any failure to generate satisfactory net sales from such expansion or alteration of our operations to offset their cost could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to payment-related risks.\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, PayPal and gift cards. As we offer new payment options to consumers, we may be subject to additional regulations, compliance requirements and fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with the rules or requirements of any provider of a payment method we accept, among other things, we may be subject to fines or higher transaction fees and may lose, or face restrictions placed upon, our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from consumers or facilitate other types of online payments. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe also may incur significant losses from fraud. We may incur losses from claims that the consumer did not authorize the purchase, from merchant fraud, from erroneous transmissions and from consumers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in them to satisfy payments. In addition to the direct costs of such losses, if they are related to credit card transactions and become excessive, they could potentially result in our losing the right to accept credit cards for payment. In addition, under current credit card practices, we are liable for fraudulent credit card transactions because we do not obtain a cardholder\u2019s signature. We do not currently carry insurance against this risk. To date, we have experienced minimal losses from credit card fraud, but we continue to face the risk of significant losses from this and other types of fraud. Our failure to adequately control fraudulent transactions could damage our reputation and brand and result in litigation or regulatory action, causing an increase in legal expenses and fees and substantially harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet and e-commerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet and e-commerce. Existing and future regulations and laws could impede the growth of the Internet, e-commerce or mobile commerce. These regulations and laws may involve taxes, tariffs, privacy and data security, anti-spam, text messages, content protection, electronic contracts and communications, consumer protection and gift cards. For example, the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s Mail or Telephone Order Merchandise Rule requires compliance with certain rules of conduct relating to shipping dates, shipping delays, customer notifications, cancellations and refunds. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes and consumer privacy apply to the Internet as the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by the Internet or e-commerce. It is possible that general business regulations and laws, or those specifically governing the Internet or e-commerce, may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices.\nWe cannot guarantee that our practices have complied, comply or will comply fully with all such laws and regulations. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our reputation, a loss in business and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Any such proceeding or action could hurt our reputation, force us to spend significant amounts in defense of these proceedings, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, decrease the use of our sites by consumers and vendors and may result in the imposition of monetary liability. We may also be contractually liable to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of non-compliance with any such laws or regulations. In addition, it is possible that governments of one or more countries may seek to censor content available on our sites or may even attempt to completely block access to our sites. Adverse legal or regulatory developments could substantially harm our business. In particular, in the event that we are restricted, in whole or in part, from operating in one or more countries, our ability to retain or increase our customer base may be adversely affected, and we may not be able to maintain or grow our net sales and expand our business as anticipated.\nFailure to comply with federal, state and international laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, or the expansion of current or the enactment of new laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, could adversely affect our business and our financial condition.\nA variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data. Laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, regulations and other legal obligations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, including those relating to the use of data for marketing purposes. It is possible, however, that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or may conflict with other rules or our practices. We cannot guarantee that our practices have complied, comply or will comply fully with all such laws, regulations, requirements and obligations. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy practices or with any federal, state or international privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations, industry self-regulatory principles, industry standards or codes of conduct, regulatory guidance, orders to which we may be subject or other legal obligations relating to privacy or consumer protection could adversely affect our reputations, brand and business, and may result in claims, proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others or other liabilities. Any such claim, proceeding or action could hurt our reputation, brand and business, force us to incur significant expenses in defense of such proceedings, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, result in a loss of customers and vendors and may result in the imposition of monetary liability. We may also be contractually liable to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of non-compliance with any laws, regulations or other legal obligations relating to privacy or consumer protection or any inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure of data that we store or handle as part of operating our business.\nFederal, state and international governmental authorities continue to evaluate the privacy implications inherent in the use of third-party \u201ccookies\u201d, \"web beacons\", and other methods of online tracking for behavioral advertising and other purposes. U.S. and foreign governments have enacted, considered or are considering legislation or regulations that could significantly restrict the ability of companies and individuals to engage in these activities, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a company can employ cookies or other electronic tracking tools. Additionally, some providers of consumer devices and web browsers have implemented, or announced plans to implement, means to make it easier for Internet users to prevent the placement of cookies, web beacons, or to block other tracking technologies, which could if widely adopted result in the use of third-party cookies, web beacons, and other methods of online tracking becoming significantly less effective. The regulation of the use of these cookies, web beacons, and other current online tracking and advertising practices or a loss in our ability to make effective use of services that employ such practices could increase our costs of operations and limit our ability to acquire new customers on cost-effective terms and consequently, materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nForeign data protection, privacy and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States. The European Union, for example, traditionally has imposed stricter obligations under its laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection than the United States. Individual EU member countries have had discretion with respect to their interpretation and implementation of these laws, resulting in variation of privacy standards from country to country. Legislation and regulation in the European Union and some EU member states require companies to obtain specific types of notice and consent from consumers before using cookies or other tracking technologies. International expansion of our operations may require changes\nin the way we use consumer information in operating our business. Compliance with such laws and regulations will result in additional costs and may necessitate changes to our business practices, which may adversely affect our business and financial condition. Further, there is no harmonized approach to legal compliance in many of these regions, and there is little regulatory guidance. Consequently, we could be at risk of non-compliance with applicable foreign data protection laws as we continue our international expansion.\nIn addition, various federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies, or self-regulatory organizations, may expand current laws or regulations, enact new laws or regulations or issue revised rules or guidance regarding privacy, data protection and consumer protection. Any such changes may force us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices. This could compromise our ability to pursue our growth strategy effectively and may adversely affect our ability to acquire customers or otherwise harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nChanges in tax treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce may adversely affect the commercial use of our sites and our financial results.\nDue to the global nature of the Internet, it is possible that various states or foreign countries might attempt to impose additional or new regulation on our business or levy additional or new sales, income or other taxes relating to our activities. Tax authorities at the international, federal, state and local levels are currently reviewing the taxation of e-commerce companies and transactions of companies engaged in e-commerce. New or revised international, federal, state or local tax regulations may subject us or our customers to additional sales, income and other taxes. We cannot predict the effect of current attempts to impose sales, income or other taxes on e-commerce. New or revised taxes and, in particular, sales taxes, VAT and similar taxes would likely increase the cost of doing business online and decrease the attractiveness of advertising and selling products over the Internet. New taxes could also create significant increases in internal costs necessary to capture data and collect and remit taxes. Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, VAT or similar taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe do not collect sales and use, VAT and similar taxes in every jurisdiction in which we have sales, based on our belief that such taxes are not applicable. Sales and use, VAT and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes on our sales may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest or future requirements may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are subject to taxes in the United States and numerous international jurisdictions. We record tax expense based on current tax payments and our estimates of future tax payments, which may include reserves for estimates of probable settlements of international and domestic tax audits. At any one time, multiple tax years and jurisdictions are subject to audit by various taxing authorities. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. As a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as taxable events occur and uncertain tax positions are re-evaluated or resolved. Further, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in tax laws, changes in the mix and level of earnings by taxing jurisdiction, changes to existing accounting rules or regulations or by changes to our ownership or capital structures. Fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate could materially and adversely affect our results of business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, we are evaluating and may adopt a corporate structure to more closely align with our international operations and any future international expansion, which will require us to incur expenses but could fail to achieve the intended benefits. This proposed corporate structure may result in a reduction in our overall effective tax rate through changes in how we use our intellectual property, international procurement and sales operations. This proposed corporate structure may also allow us to obtain financial and operational efficiencies. If we adopt this revised structure, it will require us to incur expenses in the near term for which we may not realize related benefits. If the intended structure is not accepted by the applicable taxing authorities, changes in domestic and international\ntax laws negatively impact the proposed structure, including proposed legislation to reform U.S. taxation of international business activities or we do not operate our business consistent with the proposed structure and applicable tax provisions, we may fail to achieve the financial and operational efficiencies that we anticipate as a result of the proposed structure, and our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business depends on network and mobile infrastructure, our single third-party data center hosting facility, other third-party providers, and our ability to maintain and scale our technology and provide a personalized site experience. Any significant interruptions or delays in service on our sites or any undetected errors or design faults could result in limited capacity, reduced demand, processing delays and loss of customers or vendors.\nA key element of our strategy is to generate a high volume of traffic on, and use of, our sites. Our reputation and ability to acquire, retain and serve our customers are dependent upon the reliable performance of our sites and the underlying network infrastructure. As our customer base and the amount of information shared on our sites continue to grow, we will need an increasing amount of network capacity and computing power. We have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts on data centers and equipment and related network infrastructure to handle the traffic on our sites. The operation of these systems is expensive and complex and could result in operational failures. In the event that our customer base or the amount of traffic on our sites grows more quickly than anticipated, we may be required to incur significant additional costs to enhance the underlying network infrastructure. Interruptions or delays in these systems, whether due to system failures, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, undetected errors, design faults or other unexpected events or causes, could affect the security or availability of our sites and prevent our customers from accessing our sites.\nIn order to enhance relevance for our customers, we have developed extensive data collection and analytics capabilities which allow us to anticipate the shopping preferences of our customers and then personalize their site experience. Any failure of our data analytics and personalization tools could result in reduced demand and loss of customers, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe depend on the development and maintenance of the Internet and mobile infrastructure. This includes maintenance of reliable Internet and mobile networks with the necessary speed, data capacity and security, as well as timely development of complementary products, for providing reliable Internet and mobile access and services.\nWe primarily utilize a single third-party data center hosting facility located in the United States. Nearly all of our data storage and analytics are conducted on, and the data and content we create associated with sales on our sites are processed through, servers in one facility. If we were to transition to additional servers, failure to effectively transfer our data could result in interruptions in the availability or functionality of our sites. We also rely on third-party email service providers, bandwidth providers, Internet service providers and mobile networks to deliver our email and mobile \u201cpush\u201d communications to subscribers and to allow subscribers to access our sites. Any damage to, or failure of, the systems of our third-party data center or our other third-party providers could result in interruptions to the availability or functionality of our sites. If for any reason our arrangements with our data center or third-party providers are terminated or interrupted, such termination or interruption could adversely affect our business. We exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide. We could experience additional expense in arranging for new facilities, technology, services and support. In addition, the failure of our data center or any other third-party providers to meet our capacity requirements could result in interruptions in the availability or functionality of our sites.\nThe occurrence of a natural disaster, an act of terrorism, vandalism or sabotage, a decision to close the third-party data center on which we normally operate or the facilities of any third-party provider without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in the availability of our solutions. While we have some limited disaster recovery arrangements in place, they have not been tested under actual disasters or similar events and may not effectively permit us to continue to provide our products in the event of any problems with respect to our data center or any other third-party facilities. To date, we have not experienced these types of events, but we cannot provide any assurances that they will not occur in the future. If any such event were to occur to our business, the delivery of our products could be impaired and our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to seasonal sales fluctuations which could result in volatility or have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe believe our results are impacted by a pattern of increased sales during the back-to-school shopping season in the third quarter and holiday shopping season in the fourth quarter which has resulted in increased sales during a portion of the third quarter and the fourth quarter each fiscal year, which then results in lower sequential growth in the first quarter. For example, net sales in the first quarter of 2014 decreased when compared with net sales in the fourth quarter of 2013. We also believe that we have experienced slower growth in orders placed during the late spring and early summer months. Shifts in product mix, when combined with seasonality, could further affect our overall operating results or growth rates. Our historical growth rates and limited operating history make it difficult to discern the impact of any seasonality in our business. To the extent the growth of our business slows, or our product mix changes, these seasonal fluctuations may become more evident. Seasonality may cause our working capital cash flow requirements to vary from quarter-to-quarter depending on the variability in the volume and timing of sales. These factors, among other things, make forecasting more difficult and may adversely affect our ability to manage working capital and to predict financial results accurately, which could result in volatility or adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may from time to time pursue acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our business, as could the integration of the businesses following acquisition.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may acquire other companies or businesses. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including: difficulties in integrating the technologies, operations, existing contracts and personnel of an acquired company; difficulties in supporting and transitioning vendors, if any, of an acquired company; diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition opportunities; failure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction; failure to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee or customer issues; risks of entering new markets in which we have limited or no experience; potential loss of key employees, customers and vendors from either our current business or an acquired company\u2019s business; inability to generate sufficient net sales to offset acquisition costs; additional costs or equity dilution associated with funding the acquisition; and possible write-offs or impairment charges relating to acquired businesses.\nGrowth and expansion of our international business will require management attention and resources, involves additional risks, and may be unsuccessful, which could harm our future business development and existing domestic operations.\nWe have conducted limited international business in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Ireland, but plan to grow our business in these countries and to further expand into new international markets in order to grow our overall business. These growth and expansion plans will require management attention and resources and may be unsuccessful. We have limited experience in selling our products to conform to different local cultures, standards and policies, and the flash sales model we employ and the products we offer may not appeal to customers in the same manner, if at all, in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland and other geographies. In addition, we may need to vary our practices in ways with which we have limited or no experience or which are less profitable or carry more risk to us. For example, we permit customer returns in the United Kingdom and expect that we may be required to adopt similar policies in other jurisdictions. We may have to compete with local companies which understand the local market better than we do. In addition, to deliver satisfactory performance for customers in international locations, it may be necessary to locate physical facilities, such as fulfillment centers in foreign markets, and we may have to invest in these facilities before the success or lack thereof of our international business. We may not be successful in growing our United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Ireland business and expanding into any other international markets or in generating desired levels of net sales from our international business. Furthermore, different privacy, censorship, liability, intellectual property and other laws and regulations in foreign countries may cause our business, financial condition and operating results to be materially and adversely affected.\nOur future results could be adversely affected by a number of factors inherent in international business, including:\n\u2022\nlocalization of our product offerings, including compliance with product safety regulatory schemes as well as translation into foreign languages and adaptation for local practices;\n\u2022\ndifferent consumer demand dynamics, which may make the flash sales model less successful compared to the United States;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties or other trade restrictions;\n\u2022\nrisks resulting from changes in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nmore stringent regulations relating to data security and the unauthorized use of, or access to, commercial and personal information, particularly in the European Union;\n\u2022\nreluctance to allow personally identifiable data related to non-U.S. citizens to be stored in databases within the United States, due to concerns over the U.S. government\u2019s right to access information in these databases or other concerns;\n\u2022\nchanges in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions;\n\u2022\ndiffering labor regulations where labor laws may be more advantageous to employees as compared to the United States;\n\u2022\nchallenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement and monitor appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries;\n\u2022\ndifferent or lesser intellectual property protection; and\n\u2022\nexposure to liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions.\nConducting business internationally requires significant management attention and financial resources. We cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required to establish and expand our international business will produce desired levels of net sales or profitability. If we invest substantial time and resources to establish and expand our international business and are unable to do so successfully and in a timely manner, our overall business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely on the performance of members of management and highly skilled personnel, and if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate well-qualified employees, our business could be harmed.\nWe believe our success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of Darrell Cavens, one of our founders and our president and chief executive officer, Mark Vadon, one of our founders and chairman of the board of directors, and other members of our management team. Our success also depends on our highly skilled team of employees, including our merchandising and technology personnel. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees, particularly mid-level managers and merchandising and technology personnel. The market for such positions is competitive. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract them. In addition, the loss of any of our senior management or key employees or our inability to recruit and develop mid-level managers could materially and adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements. All of our officers and other U.S. employees are at-will employees, meaning that they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nAdverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit our ability to operate our business.\nWe may become involved from time to time in private actions, collective actions, investigations and various other legal proceedings by customers, employees, suppliers, competitors, government agencies or others. The results of any such litigation, investigations and other legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, damage our reputation, require significant amounts of management time and divert significant resources. If any of these legal proceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or limits on our ability to operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe regard our subscriber list, marks, domain names, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection, agreements and other methods with our employees and others to protect our proprietary rights. We might not be able to obtain effective intellectual property protection in every country in which we sell products. The protection of our intellectual property rights may require the expenditure of significant financial, managerial and operational resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. Any of our patents, marks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. Our patent applications may never be granted. Additionally, the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. Even if issued, there can be no assurance that these patents will adequately protect our intellectual property, as the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of patent and other intellectual property rights are uncertain. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or intellectual property rights.\nWe might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any infringement, misappropriation or other violation of our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against others for infringement, misappropriation or violation of our intellectual property rights or proprietary rights or to establish the validity of such rights. Despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon, misappropriating or otherwise violating our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties.\nWe may be subject to litigation and disputes related to our intellectual property rights and technology, as well as disputes related to intellectual property and product offerings of third-party vendors featured by us. The costs of supporting such litigation and disputes are considerable, and there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be obtained.\nThe e-commerce industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights, which has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies. We are subject to claims and litigation by third parties that we infringe their intellectual property rights, and we expect additional claims and litigation with respect to infringement to occur in the future. As our business expands and the number of competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur, we expect that infringement claims may increase in number and significance. Any claims or proceedings against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time or result in the diversion of significant operational resources, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nLegal claims regarding intellectual property rights are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the oftentimes complex issues involved, and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims. In addition, some of our larger competitors have extensive portfolios of issued patents. Many potential litigants, including patent holding companies, have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. Furthermore, a successful claimant could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages or prevents us from conducting our business as we have historically done or may desire to do in the future. We might also be required to seek a license and pay royalties for the use of such intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. Alternatively, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology or intellectual property, which could require significant effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful.\nWe have received in the past, and we anticipate receiving in the future, communications alleging that certain items posted on or sold through our sites violate third-party copyrights, marks and trade names or other intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights. Brand and content owners and other proprietary rights owners have actively asserted their purported rights against online companies, including zulily. In addition to litigation from rights\nowners, we may be subject to regulatory, civil or criminal proceedings and penalties if governmental authorities believe we have aided and abetted in the sale of counterfeit or infringing products.\nSuch claims, whether or not meritorious, may result in the expenditure of significant financial, managerial and operational resources, injunctions against us or the payment of damages by us. We may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have violated their rights, but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims.\nThe inability to acquire, use or maintain our \u201czulily\u201d mark and domain names for our sites could substantially harm our business and operating results.\nWe currently are the registrant of the \u201czulily\u201d mark in numerous jurisdictions and are the registrant of the Internet domain name for our website, zulily.com, as well as various related domain names. However, we have not registered the mark or domain name in all major international jurisdictions. Domain names generally are regulated by Internet regulatory bodies and are also controlled by trademark and other related laws of each country. If we do not have or cannot obtain on reasonable terms the ability to use our \u201czulily\u201d mark in a particular country, or to use or register our domain name, we could be forced either to incur significant additional expenses to market our products within that country, including the development of a new brand and the creation of new promotional materials and packaging, or to elect not to sell products in that country. Either result could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFurthermore, the regulations governing domain names and laws protecting marks and similar proprietary rights could change in ways that block or interfere with our ability to use relevant domains or our current brand. Also, we might not be able to prevent third parties from registering, using or retaining domain names that interfere with our consumer communications or infringe or otherwise decrease the value of our marks, domain names and other proprietary rights. Regulatory bodies have established and may create additional generic or country-code top-level domains or may allow modifications of the requirements for registering, holding or using domain names. As a result, we might not be able to register, use or maintain the domain names that utilize the name zulily in all of the countries in which we currently or intend to conduct business.\nSome of our software and systems contain open source software, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software and solutions.\nWe use open source software in our software and systems and will use open source software in the future. The licenses applicable to open source software typically require that the source code subject to the license be made available to the public and that any modifications or derivative works to open source software continue to be licensed under open source licenses. From time to time, we may face claims from third parties claiming infringement of their intellectual property rights, or demanding the release or license of the open source software or derivative works that we developed using such software (which could include our proprietary source code) or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could result in litigation and could require us to purchase a costly license, publicly release the affected portions of our source code, be limited in the licensing of our technologies or cease offering the implicated solutions unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid infringement or change the use of the implicated open source software. In addition to risks related to license requirements, use of certain open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties, indemnities or other contractual protections with respect to the software (for example, non-infringement or functionality). Our use of open source software may also present additional security risks because the source code for open source software is publicly available, which may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to breach our sites and systems that rely on open source software. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and, if not addressed, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur results could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises or other catastrophic events.\nOur principal offices are located in Seattle, Washington, an area that has experienced earthquakes in the past, and are thus vulnerable to damage. We also operate a buying and studio office in Columbus, Ohio and a customer service office in Gahanna, Ohio and have fulfillment centers in McCarran, Nevada and Lockbourne, Ohio. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and other adverse weather and climate conditions; unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics; political crises, such as terrorist\nattacks, war and other political instability; or other catastrophic events, whether occurring in the United States or internationally, could disrupt our operations in any of our offices and fulfillment centers or the operations of one or more of our vendors. In particular, these types of events could impact our product supply chain, including our ability to ship products to customers, from or to the impacted region and could impact our ability or the ability of third parties to operate our sites and ship products. In addition, these types of events could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions or depending upon the severity, globally. To the extent any of these events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from growing or responding to competitive pressures.\nIn the future, we could be required to raise capital through public or private financing or other arrangements. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business. We may sell Class A common stock, convertible securities and other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell any such securities in subsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted. New investors in such subsequent transactions could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and could reduce our operational flexibility or profitability. For example, we currently have a credit facility which requires that we meet certain customary covenants that include restrictions on, among other things, indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions, dividends or other distributions. In addition, such credit facility contains certain financial covenants. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Class A Common Stock\nOur stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance, resulting in substantial losses for investors.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile for the foreseeable future. For example, since shares of our Class A common stock were sold in our initial public offering (\"IPO\") in November 2013, at a price of $22.00 per share, through February 20, 2015, our Class A common stock's daily closing price on the NASDAQ Global Select Market has ranged from a low of $14.20 to a high of $72.75. On February 20, 2015, the closing price of our Class A common stock was $14.40.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the factors listed below and other factors described in this \"Risk Factors\" section:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u2022\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of our company, changes in financial estimates or ratings or negative commentary by any securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, operating results or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology or retail companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u2022\nchanges in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our Class A common stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u2022\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of debt or equity securities;\n\u2022\nshort sales, hedging and other derivative transactions involving our capital stock;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions in the United States and abroad;\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, public health crises or responses to these events; and\n\u2022\nthe other factors described in this section of our Annual Report captioned, \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nIn addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies, including e-commerce companies. Stock prices of many technology companies, including e-commerce companies, have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our Class A common stock could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market or a conversion of a substantial number of shares of our Class B common stock into Class A common stock, or the perception that these sales or conversions might occur, could depress the market price of our Class A common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that such sales or conversions may have on the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, as of December 28, 2014, there were 751,762 shares of Class A common stock and 11,327,185 shares of Class B common stock subject to outstanding options and 365,130 shares of Class A common stock subject to unvested restricted stock unit awards. All of the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of options (or upon conversion of Class B common stock issued upon exercise of options) and vesting of restricted stock unit awards have been registered for public resale under the Securities Act. Accordingly, these shares will be able to be freely sold in the public market upon issuance as permitted by any applicable vesting requirements, subject to compliance with applicable securities laws.\nAs of December 28, 2014, holders of approximately 43.4 million shares of our common stock have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements for the public resale of Class A common stock issued or issuable upon conversion of Class B common stock or to include such shares in registration statements that we may file for zulily or other stockholders.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock and the existing ownership of capital stock by our executive officers and directors have the effect of concentrating voting control with our executive officers and directors for the foreseeable future, which will limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Given the greater number of votes per share attributed to our Class B common stock, the holders of Class B common stock collectively will continue to be able to control a majority of the voting power even if their stock holdings represent as few as approximately 9.1% of the outstanding number of shares of our common stock. As of December 28, 2014, the holders of Class B common stock collectively own shares representing approximately 91.3% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Our executive officers and directors, collectively, continue to beneficially own shares representing a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. This concentrated control will limit your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future and may cause us to make strategic decisions or pursue acquisitions that could involve risks to you or may not be aligned with your interests. For example, these stockholders will be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, increases to the number of shares available for issuance under our equity compensation plans or adoption of new equity compensation plans and approval of any merger or sale of assets for the foreseeable future. This control may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nFuture transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting on a 1:1 basis to Class A common stock, which will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long-term, which may include our executive officers and directors.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business, our market and our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain additional executive management and qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Select Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased our legal and financial compliance costs, made some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and has increased demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are required to disclose changes made in our internal control and procedures on a quarterly basis. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Although we have already hired additional employees to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire additional employees or engage outside consultants, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be adversely affected.\nBeing a public company and these new rules and regulations have made it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and in the future, we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.\nAs a result of disclosure of information in our filings with the SEC, our business and financial condition have become more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired and such failure may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our Class A common stock.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to\nbe re-evaluated frequently. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting, as well as a statement that our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an opinion on our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe and our independent registered public accounting firm previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, subsequent to the issuance of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2012, and January 1, 2012. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness identified related to the lack of sufficient technical accounting skills within our accounting and finance organization. During the three months ended March 30, 2014, we implemented steps to address the previously identified material weakness. Based on the steps implemented, which included increasing the size, depth and experience within our accounting and finance organization, as well as designing and implementing improved processes and internal controls, we concluded that we remediated the previously identified material weakness.\nIn future periods, if during the evaluation and testing process, we identify any other material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law and Washington law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;\n\u2022\npermit the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships;\n\u2022\nprovide that directors may only be removed for cause;\n\u2022\nrequire super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;\n\u2022\neliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws;\n\u2022\nrestrict the forum for certain litigation against us to Delaware;\n\u2022\nreflect the dual class structure of our common stock, as discussed above; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware,\nwe are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any holder of at least 15% of our capital stock for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became a 15% stockholder. Likewise, because our principal executive offices are located in Washington, the anti-takeover provisions of the Washington Business Corporation Act may apply to us under certain circumstances now or in the future. These provisions prohibit a \u201ctarget corporation\u201d from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any stockholder constituting an \u201cacquiring person\u201d for a period of five years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cacquiring person.\u201d\nOur certificate of incorporation also provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 14327, "SIC": 5961, "TIC": "ZU"}
