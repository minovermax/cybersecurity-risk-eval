You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d before deciding whether to invest in our common stock. The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nSummary Risk Factors\nThe below summary of risk factors provides an overview of many of the risks we are exposed to in the normal course of our business activities. As a result, the below summary risks do not contain all of the information that may be important to you, and you should read the summary risks together with the more detailed discussion of risks set forth following this section under the heading \"Risk Factors,\" as well as elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks, beyond those summarized below or discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may apply to our activities or operations as currently conducted or as we may conduct them in the future or in the markets in which we operate or may in the future operate. Consistent with the foregoing, we are exposed to a variety of risks, including risks associated with the following:\n\u2022\nWe have incurred net losses in every year since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future.\n\u2022\nOur business is highly dependent on the success of momelotinib. If we are unable to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize momelotinib, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\n\u2022\nIf further preclinical development or clinical trials of momelotinib, or any other future product candidates that we may develop or acquire fail to demonstrate acceptable safety and efficacy or do not otherwise produce positive results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of current or future product candidates.\n\u2022\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and may be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022\nWe may form or seek strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or other collaborations in the future or enter into a strategic transaction. We may be unable to form or enter into such alliances or arrangements, and we may not realize the expected benefits of any such transaction.\n\u2022\nPast and future acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and operating results.\n\u2022\nThe manufacture of momelotinib and SRA515 requires outsourced, custom manufacturing and we may encounter difficulties in production, particularly with respect to formulation, process development or scaling up of our manufacturing capabilities. If our third-party manufacturers or suppliers encounter such difficulties, our ability to provide supply of momelotinib for preclinical studies, clinical trials or our products for patients, if approved, or danazol for the MOMENTUM trial could be delayed or stopped, or we may be unable to maintain a commercially viable cost structure.\n\u2022\nOur reliance on third-party manufacturing partners or suppliers may cause our supply of research and development, preclinical and clinical development materials to become limited or interrupted or fail to be of satisfactory quantity or quality.\n\u2022\nWe face significant competition from other hematology and oncology companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to adequately prepare the market for the potential future commercialization of a product, we may not be able to generate product revenue once marketing authorization is obtained. We currently are establishing our marketing and sales organization and have limited experience in\nmarketing products. If we are unable to successfully establish marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell momelotinib or any future product candidates, we may not be able to generate product revenue.\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to obtain U.S. or foreign regulatory approval of momelotinib, and, as a result, we may be unable to commercialize momelotinib.\n\u2022\nOur internal information technology systems, or those used by our CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches.\n\u2022\nIf we or any of our independent contractors, consultants, collaborators, manufacturers, vendors or service providers fail to comply with healthcare and data privacy laws and regulations, we or they could be subject to enforcement actions, which could result in penalties and affect our ability to develop, market and sell momelotinib or any future product candidates and may harm our reputation.\n\u2022\nIf we are not able to obtain and enforce patent protection for our technologies or momelotinib, development and commercialization of our product candidates may be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nWe have a significant number of outstanding warrants which may cause significant dilution to our stockholders, have a material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock, make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future equity offerings and discourage an acquisition of us by a third party.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have incurred net losses in every year since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe are a clinical stage hematology and oncology company with a limited operating history. Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $94.7 million, $80.9 million and $88.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $941.2 million. Investment in hematology and oncology product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that any potential product candidate will fail to demonstrate adequate efficacy or an acceptable safety profile, gain regulatory approval and become commercially viable. For example, in June 2016, we decided to suspend the development of our former lead product candidate PNT2258 after an interim analysis of data from a Phase 2 clinical trial of PNT2258 indicated only modest efficacy. We have also decided to suspend the continued development of SRA141, which was licensed to Carna Biosciences in June 2020, to focus our resources on the clinical development of momelotinib, SRA515 and potentially SRA737. We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue to date, and we continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to increase as we continue the development of product candidates, fund research and preclinical studies and clinical trials, seek to identify additional product candidates, in-license additional products or technologies, seek regulatory approval, prepare for potential commercialization which will require a significant investment in areas related to contract manufacturing and inventory buildup and continue to operate as a public company.\nEven if we succeed in commercializing momelotinib, if approved, or any future product candidates we may acquire or develop, we will continue to incur substantial research and development and other expenditures to develop and market these and other product candidates for which we obtain marketing authorization. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenue. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nOur business is highly dependent on the success of momelotinib. If we are unable to successfully obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize momelotinib, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nOur business and future success depend on our ability to successfully obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize momelotinib, a potent, selective and orally bioavailable JAK1, JAK2 and ACVR1 / activin receptor-like kinase-2 (ALK2) inhibitor. Momelotinib has been investigated in two completed Phase 3 trials for the treatment of myelofibrosis, and we launched our MOMENTUM Phase 3 clinical trial for momelotinib in the fourth quarter of 2019 after receiving regulatory feedback concerning the design of the trial.\nWhile momelotinib is a late-stage product candidate for which our Phase 3 clinical trial data suggest the potential to provide promising safety and efficacy in patients who are JAK inhibitor-na\u00efve and in patients who have previously received a JAK inhibitor such as ruxolitinib, FDA may disagree with our interpretation of the data and may require additional clinical testing before we can seek regulatory approval and begin commercialization, if at all. While the FDA has provided regulatory clarity concerning the design of MOMENTUM, our Phase 3 clinical trial for momelotinib, there is no guarantee that we will obtain regulatory approval and be able to begin commercialization on the timeline as we anticipate. Before we can generate any revenue from sales of momelotinib, we must complete additional development activities, including the submission of a marketing application such as a NDA or foreign equivalent, for regulatory review and approval in at least one jurisdiction, make substantial investments, obtain access to sufficient commercial manufacturing capacity and engage in significant marketing and commercial access efforts.\nWe cannot commercialize momelotinib in the United States without first obtaining regulatory approval from the FDA. Similarly, we cannot commercialize momelotinib outside of the United States without obtaining regulatory approval from similar regulatory authorities outside of the United States, such as the EMA in Europe and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom. Applications for regulatory approval and regulatory approval of momelotinib in any jurisdiction could be delayed or be denied for many reasons, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the number, design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe population studied in the clinical trial may not be considered sufficiently broad or representative to assure safety in the full population for which we seek approval;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe data collected from clinical trials of momelotinib may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities or may otherwise not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA, marketing authorization application or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States, the European Union or elsewhere;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may require us to conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities that our product candidate\u2019s response rate, duration of response or risk-benefit ratio for its proposed indication is acceptable;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes, test procedures and specifications applicable to the manufacture of momelotinib, the facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies may fail to maintain a compliance status acceptable to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities or foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies;\n\u2022\nwe or any third-party service providers may be unable to demonstrate compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs) and/or good clinical practices (GCPs) to the satisfaction of the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, which could result in delays in regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nthe regulations or policies of the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval; or\n\u2022\npolitical factors surrounding the approval process, such as government shutdowns, political instability or global pandemics such as the outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19.\nEven if momelotinib were to be approved by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, any approval might contain significant limitations related to use restrictions for specified patient populations, age groups, warnings, precautions or contraindications, or may be subject to burdensome post-approval study or risk management requirements. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for momelotinib or any future product candidate in one or more jurisdictions, or if any approval contains significant limitations, we may not be able to obtain sufficient funding or generate sufficient revenue to continue the marketing or commercialization of momelotinib or any future product candidate. If competitive products developed by third parties show significant benefit in the indications in which we are developing momelotinib, any planned supportive or primary registration trials may be delayed, altered, terminated or not initiated and any future product candidates may never receive regulatory approval. Our clinical development programs for momelotinib or any future product candidates may also not receive regulatory approval if we have inadequate financial or other resources to advance these product candidates through the clinical trial process. Furthermore, even if we obtain regulatory approval for momelotinib or any future product candidates, we will still need to develop sales, marketing and commercialization infrastructure, or collaborate with a third party for the commercialization of such product candidates, establish commercially viable pricing and obtain approval for coverage and adequate reimbursement from third parties, including government payors. If we are unable to successfully commercialize momelotinib or any future product candidate, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to continue our business.\nIf further preclinical development or clinical trials of momelotinib, or any other future product candidates that we may develop or acquire fail to demonstrate acceptable safety and efficacy or do not otherwise produce positive results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of current or future product candidates.\nBefore obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities, including the FDA, for the sale of momelotinib or any future product candidates, we must complete preclinical development and conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of such product candidates in humans.\nThe outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later preclinical testing and clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Many companies in the biotechnology industry have suffered significant setbacks in later-stage clinical trials after achieving positive results in early-stage development, and there is a high failure rate for product candidates proceeding through clinical trials. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. For example, in June 2016, we announced that we decided to suspend the development of our former lead product candidate PNT2258 after an interim analysis of data from a Phase 2 clinical trial of PNT2258 indicated only modest efficacy. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the required efficacy and safety profile for momelotinib, or any future product candidate. A failure of one or more preclinical studies or clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing.\nWe previously acquired from Gilead momelotinib, a potent, selective and orally bioavailable JAK1, JAK2 and ACVR1/ALK2 inhibitor. Momelotinib has been investigated in two completed Phase 3 trials for the treatment of myelofibrosis, SIMPLIFY-1 and SIMPLIFY-2. Based on the results of the prespecified analyses, neither trial was considered sufficiently compelling to justify the submission of an application for regulatory approval. Although SIMPLIFY-1 met its primary efficacy endpoint of non-inferior spleen volume reduction, it did not meet its key secondary efficacy endpoint of non-inferior reduction in Total Symptom Score (TSS); and although SIMPLIFY-2 did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint of superior reduction in spleen volume, it did meet its key secondary\nefficacy endpoint of superior reduction in TSS. In both SIMPLIFY studies, additional secondary endpoints related to transfusion independence rate, transfusion dependence rate, and rate of red blood cell transfusions all favored momelotinib over control and supported the potential for momelotinib to provide meaningful anemia benefits. Based on post hoc analyses of the data for these trials that we subsequently conducted, we believe the trials showed promising substantive spleen and constitutional symptom control. In addition, we believe momelotinib has the potential to provide a differentiated therapeutic profile encompassing anemia-related benefits. As such, we have determined that there is substantial clinical justification for further development of momelotinib.\nWhile we believe the safety and efficacy profile of momelotinib in patients with myelofibrosis appears promising based on the Phase 3 trial results including the MOMENTUM Phase 3 trial, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and even if the trials are successfully completed, we cannot guarantee that the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities will interpret the results as we do, and more trials could be required before we submit momelotinib for approval. Many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products. To the extent that the results of our studies and trials are not satisfactory to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for support of a marketing application, approval of momelotinib may be significantly delayed, or we may be required to expend significant additional resources, which may not be available to us, to conduct additional trials in support of potential approval of momelotinib.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, preclinical studies and clinical trials, including the completion of our MOMENTUM clinical trial, that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize momelotinib or other product candidates, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nundesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics of momelotinib or other product candidates, causing us or our investigators, regulators or IRBs to suspend or terminate the trials;\n\u2022\nregulators or IRBs may not authorize us or our investigators to initiate a clinical trial, conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site, or amend a clinical trial;\n\u2022\ngovernment or regulatory delays and changes in regulatory requirements, policy and guidelines, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching or failure to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites and contract research organizations (CROs), or failure by such CROs or trials sites to carry out the clinical trial in accordance with the terms of our agreements with them;\n\u2022\nnegative or inconclusive results of preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nissues with data retention due to lack of adherence to privacy and data protection legislation;decision by us to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u2022\na higher number of patients being required for clinical trials or higher than expected drop out rates;\n\u2022\nclinical sites electing to terminate their participation in one of our clinical trials, which would likely have a detrimental effect on subject enrollment;\n\u2022\ndelays or difficulties with respect to our clinical trials as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as delays or difficulties in the distribution of clinical trial materials, study monitoring and data analysis;\n\u2022\nfailure of third-party contractors to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022\ninability or unwillingness of patients or medical investigators to follow our clinical trial protocols;\n\u2022\nsuspension or termination of clinical trials for various reasons, including unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\nimposition of a clinical hold for safety reasons or following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or site by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ngreater than expected cost of clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninsufficient supply or quality of product candidates or other materials, necessary to conduct clinical trials;\n\u2022\nFDA rejecting or disagreeing with our statistical plan;\n\u2022\nFDA disagreeing with the interpretation of our clinical data;\n\u2022\ndelays or additional costs as a result of the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to leave the European Union and resulting need to decouple the United Kingdom\u2019s regulatory system from that of the European Union; and\n\u2022\nrevision of legal or regulatory requirements for approving product candidates.\nIf we are required to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials or other testing of momelotinib or other product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete preclinical studies and clinical trials of momelotinib or other product candidates or other testing, or if the results of these studies, trials or tests do not reflect an acceptable safety or efficacy profile, we may:\n\u2022\nbe delayed or unable to submit additional CTAs or equivalents in one or more countries;\n\u2022\nnot have the permission of the FDA or other health authorities to commence clinical trials, or may have a clinical hold placed on one or more of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nbe delayed in obtaining marketing approval;\n\u2022\nnot obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u2022\nobtain marketing approval in some countries and not in others;\n\u2022\nobtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u2022\nobtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings, including boxed warnings;\n\u2022\nbe subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or\n\u2022\nhave the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nProduct development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or marketing approvals. We do not know whether any preclinical studies or clinical trials will continue as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant preclinical studies and clinical trial delays also could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and could impair our ability to successfully commercialize momelotinib or other product candidates, any of which may harm our business and results of operations.\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and may be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and a similar public health crises could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including the execution of our clinical trials and the use and sufficiency of our existing cash.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, financial condition and operating results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergence of new variants and increased cases which have led to the reimplementation of restrictions in many areas and the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact.\nFor instance, our MOMENTUM Phase 3 clinical trial for momelotinib was and other trials may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We launched MOMENTUM in the fourth quarter of 2019 and participant dosing, distribution of clinical trial materials, study monitoring and data analysis were and other trials may be delayed due to changes in hospital or university policies, federal, state or local regulations, prioritization of hospital resources toward COVID-19 pandemic efforts, or other reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, some participants and clinical investigators may not be able to comply with clinical trial protocols. For example, quarantines or other travel\nlimitations (whether voluntary or required) may impede participant movement, affect sponsor access to study sites, or interrupt healthcare services, and we may be unable to conduct our clinical trial. Any such delays to our planned clinical timelines could also impact the use and sufficiency of our existing cash reserves, and we may be required to raise additional capital.\nWe currently utilize third parties to, among other things, manufacture raw materials, drug product, components, parts, and consumables, perform quality testing and distribute drug product. The COVID-19 pandemic and its adverse effects have become more prevalent in the locations where our third-party manufacturing partners and suppliers conduct business and as a result, we have recently begun to experience some supply chain delays including resourcing constraints by some of our manufacturing partners. There is a risk that if our supply chain is further interrupted, it may limit our ability to source drug substance and drug product for our clinical trials and may result in delays to the timing of our commercialization and potentially increase our costs which could materially harm our business. We may experience constrained supply of momelotinib, SRA515 or, with respect to our planned clinical trials, we could again experience delays in planned site initiations and activations, or experience delays in enrollment, participant dosing, distribution of clinical trial materials, study monitoring and data analysis that could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and overall financial performance in future periods. Specifically, we may experience impact from changes in how we and companies worldwide conduct business due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to restrictions on travel and in-person meetings, prioritization of hospital resources toward pandemic effort, delays in review by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies, and further disruptions in our supply chain for momelotinib or SRA515. Any such delays to our planned development timelines and pre-commercialization efforts could also impact the use and sufficiency of our existing cash reserves, and we may be required to raise additional capital. Challenging and uncertain economic conditions can make capital raising costly and dilutive. We may be unable to raise additional capital if and when needed, which may result in delays or suspension of our development and potential commercial launch plans.\nFurther, infections and deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic are disrupting certain healthcare and healthcare regulatory systems globally. Such disruptions could divert healthcare resources away from, or materially delay review by, the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies. As a result of the FDA\u2019s updated industry guidance for conducting clinical trials issued on March 18, 2020, as subsequently updated by the FDA, we may be required to make certain adjustments to our clinical trials, which could delay the submission of our NDA and regulatory approval and increase our costs. It is unknown how long these disruptions could continue, were they to occur. Any elongation or de-prioritization of our clinical trial or delay in regulatory review resulting from such disruptions could materially adversely affect the development and study of our product candidates. The COVID-19 pandemic may also impact the resources and the availability of FDA to provide feedback and regulatory review or to conduct pre-approval inspections on a timely basis, which will delay our regulatory approval and increase our costs.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our employees continue their work outside of our office. In the event of a shelter-in-place order or other mandated local travel restrictions, third parties conducting clinical or manufacturing activities may not be able to access laboratory or manufacturing space, and our core activities may be significantly limited or curtailed, possibly for an extended period of time.\nThe spread of COVID-19, which has caused a broad impact globally, including restrictions on travel and quarantine policies put into place by businesses and governments, may have a material adverse effect on our business. While the potential economic impact brought by and the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, it has already caused, and is likely to result in further, significant disruption of global financial markets and the trading prices for our common stock and other biopharmaceutical companies have been highly volatile as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may reduce our ability to access capital either at all or on favorable terms. In addition, a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the global effort to control COVID-19 infections could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or any other health epidemic, is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our clinical trials, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material adverse impact on our operations, and we will continue to monitor the situation closely. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nIf we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in future clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nWe may experience difficulties in patient enrollment in clinical trials for a variety of reasons. The timely completion of clinical trials in accordance with their protocols depends, among other things, on our ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who remain in the trial until its conclusion. The enrollment of patients depends on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe number and size of clinical trials for other product candidates in the same therapeutic area that are currently in clinical development, and our ability to compete with such trials for patients and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\nthe patient eligibility criteria defined in the protocols;\n\u2022\nthe size of the specific patient populations such as those whose tumors harbor the applicable genetic mutations, if required or other defined subsets of a larger patient population;\n\u2022\nthe risk that disease progression will result in death or clinical deterioration before the patient can enroll in clinical trials or before sufficient data has been collected such that the patient contributes no meaningful information for the clinical trial in which the patient is enrolled;\n\u2022\nthe proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients;\n\u2022\nthe design of the trials, including the inclusion of a placebo or comparator arm in a trial;\n\u2022\nour ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain and maintain patient consents;\n\u2022\nthe risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the trials before completion; and\n\u2022\ndelays and difficulties in enrollment or patient retention in the trial due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur future clinical trials may compete with other clinical trials for product candidates that are in the same therapeutic areas as our product candidates. This competition reduces the number and types of patients and qualified clinical investigators available to us, because some patients who might have opted to enroll in our trials may instead opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors or clinical trial sites may not allow us to conduct our clinical trial at such site if competing trials are already being conducted there. Since the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited, we expect to conduct some of our clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors use, which will reduce the number of patients who are available for our clinical trials in such clinical trial site. We may also encounter difficulties finding a clinical trial site at which to conduct our trials. Moreover, potential patients and their doctors may be inclined to use conventional therapies, such as chemotherapy, radiation and other approved therapies, rather than enroll patients in any one of our clinical trials. Global pandemics, such as COVID-19, have negatively affected site initiation, as well as recruitment and retention, at sites in regions or cities whose health care system have become overwhelmed due to the pandemic. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, during our MOMENTUM clinical trial several sites paused enrollment or deprioritized clinical trial activities and enrollment. In the future, we may also experience delays or pauses in the delivery of required site activity equipment.\nDelays in patient enrollment may result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of our planned clinical trials, which could prevent completion of these clinical trials and adversely affect our ability to advance any product candidates we may develop.\nWe have acquired momelotinib from a third party that had already conducted or was in the process of conducting clinical trials. Our acquisition of momelotinib has resulted in us being required to take over responsibility for conducting ongoing momelotinib trials. We may discover that development efforts of the third parties, including but not limited to historical studies and trials conducted by third parties, did not comply with all applicable rules and regulations. Further development and commercialization of momelotinib will require significant financial and operational resources from us.\nPrior to our acquisition of momelotinib, third parties had been responsible for all development activities including, drug process, preclinical and clinical development activities, submission of CTAs and INDs, development of the trial protocols, establishment and management of clinical and safety databases, submission of a pediatric investigation plan (PIP), and other activities. Although we believe the historical development activities were conducted in accordance with applicable rules and regulations in material respects, we cannot assure you that we will not discover inaccuracies or noncompliance in prior development activities that have an adverse effect on the future development of momelotinib. For example, a regulatory authority may choose to inspect an investigational site and/or vendor such as a CRO for a momelotinib study that was previously conducted by Gilead such as the SIMPLIFY-1 or SIMPLIFY-2 studies. Findings from such inspections could have an impact on the review of any future marketing applications by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities.\nIn connection with our acquisition of momelotinib, we have assumed the responsibility for ongoing clinical studies with momelotinib, including related expenses and manufacturing and regulatory activities, which were previously managed and funded by Gilead. This includes responsibility for the ongoing extended access study, which provides extended access of momelotinib to certain patients previously enrolled in Gilead-sponsored studies, who are currently receiving treatment with momelotinib and have not experienced progression of disease. Further, extended access programs provide supportive safety information for regulatory review. Any adverse events or reactions experienced by subjects in the extended access program may be attributed to momelotinib and may limit our ability to obtain regulatory approval with labeling that we consider desirable, or at all.\nWe plan to develop product candidates in combination with momelotinib, which can expose us to additional risks.\nWe plan to develop product candidates in combination with momelotinib or other approved or unapproved therapies. Even if any product candidate we develop were to receive marketing approval or be commercialized for use in combination with other existing therapies, we would continue to be subject to the risks that the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities outside of the United States could revoke approval of the therapy used in combination with our product or that safety, efficacy, manufacturing or supply issues could arise with any of those existing therapies. If the therapies we use in combination with our product candidates are replaced as the standard of care for the indications we choose for any of our product candidates, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to conduct additional clinical trials prior to approval of the combination therapy. The occurrence of any of these risks could result in our own products, if approved, being removed from the market, require significantly limiting label changes or being less successful commercially.\nWe also may choose to evaluate product candidates in combination with one or more therapies that have not yet been approved for marketing by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. We will not be able to market and sell any product candidate we develop in combination with an unapproved therapy for a combination indication if that unapproved therapy does not ultimately obtain marketing approval either alone or in combination with our product. In addition, unapproved therapies used in combination face the same regulatory and clinical risks described with respect to our product candidates currently in development and clinical trials, including the potential for serious adverse effects, delay in their clinical trials and lack of FDA approval. If the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities do not approve these other drugs or revoke their approval of, or if safety, efficacy, quality, manufacturing or supply issues arise with, the drugs we choose to evaluate in combination with our product candidate we develop, we may be unable to obtain approval of or market such combination therapy.\nFrom time to time we may amend the clinical protocols for our product candidates to include additional objectives that could yield important scientific information critical to our overall development strategy. The protocol amendment process requires review and approval by several review bodies, including regulatory agencies and scientific, regulatory and ethics boards. These protocol amendments may not be accepted by the review bodies in the form submitted, or at all, which may delay our planned enhancements to the clinical development program and/or limit or change the type of information we may gather from those studies.\nRegulatory, scientific, ethics committee, and possibly other reviews will be required during the activation process for our any product candidates before the protocol is active at any particular site. It is possible that these reviews could require changes to the design of the study. If the FDA, EMA, MHRA, an ethics committee or scientific review board, or another regulatory authority objects to or otherwise does not accept or approve any future protocols or protocol amendments or requires us to further modify trial protocols, our related planned clinical development program may be delayed or suspended and/or we may not be able to gather information we think would be useful to advance development of our product candidates, and our development programs may be adversely affected.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate, such as momelotinib, and fail to capitalize on product candidates that may later prove to be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. In addition, we may intentionally halt or terminate programs in order to conserve capital and focus on our remaining program or programs, which may increase our reliance on those programs to be successful.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus our resources on our product candidate, momelotinib. As a result, we may advertently or inadvertently forgo or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates, including SRA737, that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable product candidates. In addition, if we halt or terminate programs in order to conserve capital and focus on our remaining program or programs, it may increase our reliance on the success of such programs and raise our exposure to the risk of failure among any of our programs.\nWhile we have currently deprioritized development of SRA737, we are exploring options for future development of this product candidate, if any. However, there can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain development support or the funding, through partnership or collaborations, necessary to advance SRA737 on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nIf we do not achieve our projected development and commercialization goals in the timeframes we announce and expect, our stock price may decline.\nFrom time to time, we estimate the timing of the anticipated accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory, product development and commercialization goals, which we sometimes refer to as milestones. These milestones may include the commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials and the submission of regulatory filings. From time to time, we may publicly announce the expected timing of some of these milestones. All of these milestones are and will be based on numerous assumptions. The actual timing of these milestones can vary dramatically compared to our estimates, in some cases for reasons beyond our control. If we do not meet these milestones as publicly announced, our stock price may decline.\nWe may form or seek strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or other collaborations in the future or enter into a strategic transaction. We may be unable to form or enter into such alliances or arrangements, and we may not realize the expected benefits of any such transaction.\nWe evaluate strategic alliances or licensing arrangements, joint ventures or collaborations with third parties and other strategic transactions from time to time including those that will complement or augment our development and commercialization efforts with respect to momelotinib and any future product candidates that we may acquire or develop, or that may provide for other economic value.\nFor example, in August 2021, we entered into a license agreement with AstraZeneca for an exclusive global license for SRA515 and related compounds. Such license agreement imposes specified diligence, milestone payment, royalty, commercialization, development and other obligations on us and require us to meet development timelines, or to exercise diligent or commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products, in order to maintain the license. AstraZeneca has the right to terminate a license if we materially breach the agreement and fail to cure such breach within a specified period, in the event of certain patent challenges or in the event we undergo certain bankruptcy events. In spite of our best efforts, our current or any future licensors might conclude that we have materially breached our license agreements and might therefore terminate the license agreements. If our license agreements are terminated, we may lose our rights to develop and commercialize product candidates and technology, lose patent protection, experience significant delays in the development and commercialization of our product candidates and technology, and incur liability for damages. If these in-licenses are terminated, or if the underlying intellectual property fails to provide the intended exclusivity, our competitors or other third parties could have the freedom to seek regulatory approval of, and to market, products and technologies identical or competitive to ours and we may be required to cease our development and commercialization of certain of our product candidates and technology. In addition, we may seek to obtain additional licenses from our licensors and, in connection with obtaining such licenses, we may agree to amend our existing licenses in a manner that may be more favorable to the licensors, including by agreeing to terms that could enable third parties, including our competitors, to receive licenses to a portion of the intellectual property that is subject to our existing licenses and to compete with any product candidates we may develop and our technology. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Disputes may arise between us and our licensors regarding intellectual property rights subject to a license agreement, including:\n\u2022\nthe scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u2022\nwhether and the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property rights of the licensor that are not subject to the license agreement;\n\u2022\nour right to sublicense intellectual property rights to third parties under collaborative development relationships;\n\u2022\nour diligence obligations with respect to the use of the licensed technology in relation to our development and commercialization of the licensed product, and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations; and\n\u2022\nthe ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners.\nWe are generally also subject to all of the same risks with respect to protection of intellectual property that we license as we are for intellectual property that we own. If we or our licensor fail to adequately protect this intellectual property, our ability to develop, manufacture or commercialize products could suffer.\nIf disputes over intellectual property rights that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects may be adversely affected.\nIn June 2020, we licensed SRA141 back to Carna Biosciences, the original licensor. We may be entitled to certain profit share on royalty and non-royalty income and royalties on product sales. If Carna Biosciences or its collaborators fail to successfully develop and commercialize SRA141, we will receive limited to no value from this transaction. In September 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with CRT Pioneer Fund LP (CPF) for worldwide rights, know-how and materials to develop SRA737, a small molecule inhibitor targeting Chk1, a promising therapeutic target to treat cancer. If we fail to meet our diligence and other obligations under the license agreement, we could lose our rights to this technology. These licensing agreements or any future strategic transactions and relationships may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders, disrupt our management and business, forego potential future economic value or result in the loss of strategic value. These transactions and relationships also may result in a delay in the development of momelotinib or any future product candidates if we become dependent upon the other party and such other party does not prioritize the development of such product candidates relative to its other development activities.\nIn addition, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for momelotinib because it may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort or third parties may not view momelotinib as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy. We cannot be certain that, following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve the revenue or specific net income that would justify such transaction.\nPast and future acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe evaluate additional businesses or product candidates from third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing momelotinib program. For example, in August 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Gilead whereby we acquired worldwide rights to the pharmaceutical product momelotinib, an investigational orally bioavailable JAK1, JAK2 and ACVR1/ALK2 inhibitor together with all related intellectual property rights and certain other related assets. Even if the assets we acquire have promising markets or technologies, we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring such assets if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture. We may encounter numerous difficulties in developing, manufacturing and marketing any new product candidates resulting from an acquisition, including momelotinib, which may delay or prevent us from realizing their expected benefits or enhancing our business. We cannot assure you that, following any such acquisition, we will achieve the expected synergies or benefits from the asset to justify the transaction. The risks we face in connection with strategic transactions, including our acquisition of momelotinib, include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges;\n\u2022\nintegration of research and development efforts;\n\u2022\nhiring or training of key employees with knowledge regarding the acquired asset;\n\u2022\nchanges in relationships with strategic partners as a result of product acquisitions or strategic positioning resulting from the acquisition;\n\u2022\ncultural challenges associated with integrating employees, knowledge and processes related to the acquired asset into our organization;\n\u2022\nunanticipated write-offs or charges; and\n\u2022\nlitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired asset.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities and harm the business generally. There is also a risk that future acquisitions will result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses or incremental operating expenses, any of which could harm our financial condition or operating results.\nProvisions of any debt instruments, including the Loan and Security Agreement, may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nIn January 2022, we entered into a Loan Agreement with Oxford Finance, LLC pursuant to which we may obtain a loan up to an aggregate principal amount of $125.0 million (of which $50.0 million is subject to the lender\u2019s sole discretion) in four tranches based on certain pre-determined milestones. The Loan and Security Agreement requires us, and any debt instruments we may enter into in the future may require us, to comply with various covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\ndispose of assets;\n\u2022\ncomplete mergers or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nincur indebtedness;\n\u2022\nencumber assets;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions to holders of our capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake specified investments;\n\u2022\nchange certain key management personnel; and\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with our affiliates.\nThese restrictions could inhibit our ability to pursue our business strategies. The Loan and Security Agreement includes customary events of default, including, among others, payment defaults, breach of representations and warrants, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other debt, judgment defaults, insolvency and bankruptcy defaults, a material adverse change default and delisting of our common stock. If we default under the Loan and Security Agreement, and such event of default was not cured or waived, the lenders could terminate commitments to lend and cause all amounts then outstanding with respect to the debt to be due and payable immediately, which in turn could result in cross defaults under any other debt instruments then outstanding. Our assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under all of our outstanding debt instruments if some or all of these instruments are accelerated upon a default.\nWe may incur additional indebtedness in the future. The debt instruments governing such indebtedness could contain provisions that are as, or more, restrictive than our existing debt instruments. The credit facility under the Loan and Security Agreement is secured by a lien covering substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property, until the first date on which the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the term loans equals or exceeds $50.0 million, at which time we agree to grant a security interest in our intellectual property. If we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness when payment is due, the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness or force us into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nThe manufacturing of our product candidates may require outsourced, custom manufacturing and we may encounter difficulties in production, particularly with respect to formulation, process development or scaling up of our manufacturing capabilities. If our third-party manufacturers or suppliers encounter such difficulties, our ability to provide supply of our product candidates for preclinical studies, clinical trials or our products for patients, if approved, could be delayed or stopped, or we may be unable to maintain a commercially viable cost structure.\nAs product candidates are developed, it is common that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods, are altered along the way in an effort to optimize processes and results. Such changes carry the risk that they will not achieve these intended objectives, and any of these changes could cause our product candidates to perform differently and affect the results of planned preclinical studies or future clinical trials.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic we have recently begun to experience some supply chain delays including resourcing constraints by some of our manufacturing partners. There is a risk that if our supply chain is further interrupted, it would limit our ability to source drug substance and drug product for our clinical trials and may result in delays to the timing of our commercialization plans and could potentially increase our costs which would materially harm our business.\nAlthough we are working to develop commercially viable manufacturing processes, doing so is a difficult and uncertain task, and there are risks associated with scaling to the level required for advanced clinical trials or commercialization, including, among others, cost overruns, potential problems with process scale up or formulation, process reproducibility, stability issues, lot consistency and timely availability of reagents or raw materials.\nAny of these challenges could delay completion of preclinical studies or clinical trials, require bridging studies or trials, or the repetition of one or more studies or trials, increase development costs, delay approval of our product candidates, impair commercialization efforts, increase our cost of goods and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur reliance on third-party manufacturing partners or suppliers may cause our supply of research and development, preclinical and clinical development materials as well as future commercial product to become limited or interrupted or fail to be of satisfactory quantity or quality.\nWe do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We have relied on third parties for the manufacture and supply of preclinical and clinical trial materials in relation to momelotinib and SRA515, including materials for any combination therapy trials that we may undertake, and any future potential product candidates that we may develop for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if momelotinib receives marketing approval. We have engaged, or expect to engage, third-party manufacturers to obtain materials and consumables necessary for the manufacture of momelotinib.\nWe may be unable to establish further agreements with third-party manufacturers and suppliers or to do so on acceptable terms. Even if we are able to establish agreements with third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers and suppliers entails additional risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nreliance on the third party for sufficient quantity and quality;\n\u2022\nthe possible breach of the manufacturing or supply agreement by the third party;\n\u2022\nfailure to manufacture or supply the product according to our specifications;\n\u2022\nfailure to manufacture or supply the product according to our schedule or at all;\n\u2022\nthe possible mislabeling of clinical supplies, potentially resulting in the wrong dose amounts being supplied or active drug or comparator not being properly identified;\n\u2022\nmisappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how;\n\u2022\nthe possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us;\n\u2022\nthe possibility of clinical supplies not being delivered to clinical sites on time, leading to clinical trial interruptions; and\n\u2022\nthe reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance, quality assurance and safety reporting.\nWhile we require our third-party manufacturers and suppliers to comply with cGMPs in the manufacture of clinical trial materials and commercial supply, should we obtain approval of momelotinib, these third-party manufacturers and suppliers may cease to continue to comply with cGMPs-which are FDA requirements for ensuring product quality control-or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Our contract manufacturers and suppliers are subject to continual review and periodic inspections to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, although we are not involved in the day-to-day operations of our contract manufacturers or suppliers, we are ultimately responsible for ensuring that our products and product candidates, and any other materials that may be used in our preclinical studies or clinical trials, are manufactured or supplied in accordance with cGMPs. Therefore, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, quality control and quality assurance. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in momelotinib not being approved or sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of momelotinib or approved products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our medicines and harm our business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, our third-party manufacturers have experienced and may continue to experience manufacturing difficulties due to resource constraints or as a result of labor disputes, or unstable political environments, or medical pandemics such as the COVID-19 outbreak. For example, many of our raw materials for manufacture of momelotinib are produced in Asia which could impact our ability to manufacture and supply material for clinical and commercial supply. If our contract manufacturers were to encounter any manufacturing difficulties or delays due to these factors, our ability to provide product candidates to patients in clinical trials, or to provide product for treatment of patients once approved, would be jeopardized.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for the supply of the raw materials required for the production of our product candidates, and we expect to some extent continue to rely on third-party manufacturers for the commercial supply of any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our dependence on these third-party suppliers and the challenges we may face in obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials involve several risks, including limited control over pricing, availability, quality, and delivery schedules and non-exclusivity. As a small company, our negotiation leverage is limited, and we are likely to get lower priority than our competitors who are larger than we are. We do not have long-term supply agreements, and we purchase our required supplies on a development manufacturing services agreement or purchase order basis. We cannot be certain that our suppliers will continue to provide us with the quantities of these raw materials that we require to satisfy our anticipated specifications and quality requirements. Any supply interruption in limited or sole sourced raw materials could materially harm our ability to manufacture our product candidates until a new source of supply, if any, could be identified and qualified. We may be unable to find a sufficient alternative supply channel in a reasonable time or on commercially reasonable terms. Any performance failure on the part of our suppliers could delay the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates, including limiting supplies necessary for clinical trials and regulatory approvals, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAny performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers or suppliers, any interruption or poor yield or quality of manufactured or supplied materials, or any interruption or delay caused by a third party being subject to governmental regulations or moratoriums could result in additional costs, not having sufficient quantities or sufficient quality and may delay, prevent or impair our development, commercialization or marketing efforts. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply. If any one of our current contract manufacturers or suppliers cannot perform as agreed, we may be required to replace that manufacturer or supplier. Although we believe that there are several potential alternative manufacturers or suppliers who could manufacture or supply momelotinib or the materials for trials relating to our product candidates, we may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacement.\nIf our third-party manufacturers or suppliers use hazardous and biological materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for damages. Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including chemical and biological materials, by our third-party manufacturers or suppliers. Our manufacturers and suppliers are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations in the United States governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of medical and hazardous materials. Although we believe that our manufacturers\u2019 and our suppliers\u2019 procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from medical or hazardous materials. As a result of any such contamination or injury, we may incur liability or local, city, state or federal authorities may curtail the use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines, and the liability could exceed our resources.\nWe do not have any insurance for liabilities arising from medical or hazardous materials. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nThus, our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture or supply of momelotinib or other product candidates and related medicines and materials may adversely affect our development timeline, our future profit margins or our ability to commercialize momelotinib or any future product candidates that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could halt their development, prevent their regulatory approval, limit their commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences.\nIt is possible that the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may not agree with any assessment of the safety profile of momelotinib. Undesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us, IRBs, our CROs, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or discontinue development and could result in a clinical hold on any clinical trial, or the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for any or\nall targeted indications. This, in turn, could prevent us from commercializing product candidates and generating revenues from their sale. In addition, if any of our products cause serious or unexpected side effects or are associated with other safety risks after receiving marketing approval, a number of potential significant negative consequences could result, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of this product;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to recall the product, change the way it is administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product;\n\u2022\nthe product may be rendered less competitive and sales may decrease;\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer generally both among clinicians and patients;\n\u2022\nwe may be exposed to potential lawsuits and associated legal expenses, including costs of resolving claims;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require certain labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications or limitations on the indications for use, or impose restrictions on distribution in the form of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) in connection with approval, if any;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials; or\n\u2022\nwe may be required to change or stop other ongoing clinical trials that may negatively impact the development of the agent for other indications.\nIf our clinical data demonstrates that momelotinib has an unfavorable safety profile and is unlikely to receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized, we may voluntarily suspend or terminate future development of momelotinib.\nAny one or a combination of these events could prevent us from obtaining approval and achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing momelotinib, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from the sale of the product.\nWe may need to obtain additional capital to complete the potential commercialization of momelotinib and the development and potential commercialization of any future product candidates.\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $104.7 million as of December 31, 2021. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional proceeds received by us during the first quarter of 2022.\nWe expect to spend substantial capital to advance momelotinib or any future product candidates, in preclinical and clinical development, seek regulatory approvals for such product candidates, establish a commercial sales force to market and manufacture products, if any, that are approved for commercial sale. We also incur significant compliance and administrative costs as a result of operating as a public company.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe results of our planned preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe scope, progress, results and costs of product candidate discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our current and future product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of momelotinib and any other future product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe costs of medical affairs and pre-commercialization activities, including regulatory and reimbursement analysis and market research;\n\u2022\nthe costs of future commercialization activities, including drug sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for momelotinib or any future product candidates for which we receive marketing approval, to the extent that such sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution are not the responsibility of any collaborator;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we acquire or in-license other drugs and technologies, or to which we out-license our own products and technologies;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we acquire or invest in business, products or technologies, although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we are able to enter into strategic partnerships, collaborations and alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties including for the commercialization of momelotinib in certain global regions;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\nthe success of any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of milestone and royalty payments;\n\u2022\nthe amount of revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of momelotinib or any future product candidates, should any such product candidates receive marketing approval;\n\u2022\nthe costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims; and\n\u2022\nthe compliance and administrative costs associated with being a public company.\nIdentifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve drug sales. In addition, momelotinib, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of momelotinib, if approved, which we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives.\nWe cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we require but are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the commercialization of momelotinib or other research and development initiatives. In particular, we do not have sufficient funds on hand to adequately prepare for future momelotinib commercialization, if approved. We could also be required to seek collaborators for momelotinib, at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available or relinquish or license on unfavorable terms our rights to such product candidates in markets where we otherwise would seek to pursue development or commercialization ourselves. We also may be unable to acquire additional promising product candidates.\nWe do not have our own laboratory facilities. We rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of or commercialize momelotinib.\nWe do not have our own laboratory facilities. We depend upon independent investigators and collaborators, such as universities, medical institutions, CROs and strategic partners to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. We expect to have to negotiate budgets and contracts with CROs and trial sites, which may result in delays to our development timelines and increased costs. We will rely heavily on these third parties over the course of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and we control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and these third parties are required to comply with GCPs and GLPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for clinical and non-clinical research\nintended to support a submission or application to FDA or the comparable foreign authority. Regulatory authorities enforce these requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of these third parties fail to comply with applicable requirements, the data generated in our studies and trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional studies or trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that, upon inspection, such regulatory authorities will determine that any of our studies or trials comply with the GCP or GLP requirements. In addition, our studies and trials must be conducted with drug product produced under cGMPs. Our failure or any failure by these third parties to comply with these regulations or to recruit a sufficient number of patients may require us to repeat studies or trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. Moreover, our business may be implicated if any of these third parties violates federal or state fraud and abuse or false claims laws and regulations or healthcare privacy and security laws.\nAny third parties conducting our preclinical studies and clinical trials will not be our employees and, except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing preclinical, clinical and nonclinical programs. These third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical studies or other drug development activities, which could affect their performance on our behalf. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our studies and trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to complete development of, obtain regulatory approval of or successfully commercialize momelotinib. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for momelotinib would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.\nWe may be required to suspend, repeat or terminate our clinical trials if they are not conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, the results are negative or inconclusive, or the trials are not well-designed.\nRegulatory agencies, IRBs or data safety monitoring boards may at any time recommend the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials or request that we cease using investigators in the clinical trials if they believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, or that they present an unacceptable safety risk to participants. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCPs, or other applicable foreign regulatory authority guidelines. Clinical trials are subject to oversight by the FDA, foreign regulatory authorities and IRBs at the study sites where the clinical trials are conducted. In addition, clinical trials must be conducted with product candidates produced in accordance with applicable cGMPs. Clinical trial data may be rejected by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities or clinical trials may be suspended by the FDA, foreign regulatory authorities, or us for various reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ndeficiencies in the conduct of the clinical trials, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or clinical protocols or to obtain or maintain clinical trial data in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndeficiencies in the clinical trial operations or trial sites;\n\u2022\nthe product candidate may have unforeseen adverse side effects;\n\u2022\ndeficiencies in the trial designs necessary to demonstrate efficacy;\n\u2022\nfatalities or other adverse events (AEs) arising during a clinical trial due to medical problems that may or may not be related to clinical trial treatments;\n\u2022\nthe product candidates may not appear to be more effective than current therapies;\n\u2022\nthe quality or stability of the product candidates may fall below acceptable standards; or\n\u2022\nfailure to adequately demonstrate study conduct oversight, ensure data integrity, and that clinical trial sites complied with the principles of GCPs.\nAlthough we have never been asked by a regulatory agency, IRB or data safety monitoring board to temporarily or permanently discontinue a clinical trial, if we elect or are forced to suspend or terminate a clinical trial of any\nproduct candidates, the commercial prospects for that product will be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue from that product may be delayed or eliminated. For example, in June 2016, we decided to suspend the development of our former lead product candidate PNT2258 after an interim analysis of data from a Phase 2 clinical trial on PNT2258 indicated only modest efficacy. Furthermore, any of these events could prevent us or our partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing momelotinib and impair our ability to generate revenue from the commercialization of these products either by us or by our collaboration partners.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval to market momelotinib, the market may not be receptive to our product.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for momelotinib, it may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and/or the medical community. We believe that the degree of market acceptance will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ntiming of market introduction of momelotinib and competitive products;\n\u2022\nsafety and efficacy of our product;\n\u2022\nprevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022\npotential advantages or disadvantages over alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nstrength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022\nprice of our products, both in absolute terms and relative to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\navailability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors and patients\u2019 willingness to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of such coverage and adequate reimbursement; and\n\u2022\nsequencing of available products.\nIf momelotinib is approved for commercial sale and fails to achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to generate significant revenue or achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe may be subject to requests for access to momelotinib. Demand for compassionate use of our unapproved therapies could strain our resources, delay our drug development activities, negatively impact our regulatory approval or commercial activities, and result in losses.\nWe are developing momelotinib to treat a life-threatening illness for which there are currently limited therapeutic options. Other companies in our field have been the target of campaigns requesting access to unapproved drugs. If we experience similar request for access campaigns, we may experience significant disruption to our business which could result in losses. We are a small company with limited resources, and any unanticipated trials or access programs resulting from requests for access could deplete our drug supply, increase our capital expenditures, reduce the availability of potentially eligible clinical trial participants, and otherwise divert our resources from our primary goals.\nIn addition, legislation referred to as \u201cRight to Try\u201d laws have been introduced at the local and national levels, which are intended to give patients access to unapproved therapies. New and emerging legislation regarding expanded access to unapproved drugs for life-threatening illnesses could negatively impact our business in the future. Either activism or legislation related to requests for access may require us to initiate an unanticipated expanded access program or to make momelotinib more widely available sooner than anticipated.\nPatients who receive access to unapproved drugs through compassionate use or expanded access programs have life-threatening illnesses and generally have exhausted all other available therapies. The risk for serious adverse events, including those which may be unrelated to momelotinib, in this patient population is high and could have a negative impact on the safety profile of momelotinib, which could cause significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize momelotinib and could materially harm our business. In addition, in order to perform the controlled clinical trials required for regulatory approval and successful commercialization of momelotinib, we may receive\nadverse publicity or experience other disruptions if we do not provide compassionate use access or expanded access programs in response to requests for access from patients in the US or elsewhere in the world. Should we agree to provide compassionate use access or decide to initiate an expanded access program, we could experience adverse publicity or other disruptions related to current or potential participants in such programs. Similarly, we could experience adverse publicity or other disruptions if we were to restructure or pause any compassionate use and/or expanded access program after initiating such a program or after the provision of our product through compassionate access to an individual patient or patients.\nWe do not have our own laboratory facilities or the ability to discover product candidates. We rely on licensing, acquisition and other forms of strategic relationship to grow our pipeline. Our efforts to acquire additional product candidates and grow our pipeline may be unsuccessful.\nWe do not have our own laboratory facilities or the ability to discover product candidates. We rely on licensing, acquisition and other forms of strategic relationships to grow our pipeline. We may acquire, or enter into strategic relationships to identify, license and develop, one or more additional product candidates to grow our pipeline. In addition, we may desire to renegotiate our currently existing licensing or asset purchase agreements for any of our product candidates. The identification, evaluation, development and potential acquisition or licensing of additional product candidates is expensive and time-consuming, and our efforts may not lead to the acquisition or licensing of any additional product candidates, that can be successfully developed and commercialized. Competition for viable product candidates is intense, and the acquisition or licensing of product candidates may be more expensive than we are able to afford or may require us to seek additional financing. If our efforts do not lead to the acquisition or successful identification, development and licensing of suitable product candidates, we may be unable to grow our pipeline. In addition, if our efforts to grow our pipeline require us to pursue additional dilutive capital or debt financing strategies, we may experience harm to our financial position and stability.\nEven if we are successful in continuing to build our pipeline, the potential product candidates that we identify may not be suitable for clinical development. For example, they may be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be drugs that will receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance. If we do not successfully develop and commercialize product candidates based upon our approach, we will not be able to obtain product revenue in future periods, which likely would result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely affect our stock price.\nWe face significant competition from other hematology and oncology companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe hematology and oncology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We may face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies that are available for the indication or indications for which they are approved and new therapies that may become available in the future.\nTo our knowledge, there are currently three approved myelofibrosis drugs that specifically rely on JAK inhibition. Ruxolitinib, marketed by Incyte Corporation as Jakafi\u00ae in the United States and by Novartis as Jakavi in the rest of the world and fedratinib, marketed by Celgene Corporation (now part of Bristol Meyers Squibb (BMS)) as Inrebic\u00ae in the United States and Europe. Both of these are approved for intermediate and high-risk myelofibrosis. Recently, pacritinib, marketed by CTI Biopharma Corp as Vonjo\u00ae was approved for a subset of myelofibrosis patients with platelet counts less than 50,000/uL. However, to our knowledge, there are no drugs that target JAK1, JAK2 and ACVR1/ALK2 on the market, nor in development. Other competitors developing myelofibrosis therapeutics include BMS, Morphosys (formerly Constellation Pharma), AbbVie, Kartos, Incyte and Geron. BMS is developing luspatercept in a Phase 3 clinical trial for myelofibrosis. Morphosys is developing pelabresib (CPI-0610), a BET inhibitor in Phase 3 clinical trial in combiniation with ruxolitinib. AbbVie is currently conducting two Phase 3 clinical trials in combination with ruxolitinib for JAKi na\u00efve and previously JAKi treated patients. Kartos announced clinical trial plans for KRT-232, a MDM2 inhibitor for JAKi relapsed or refractory myelofibrosis patients. Incyte is conducting Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate parsaclisib, in combination with ruxolitinib. Geron is conducting a Phase 3 trial for imetelstat for relapsed and refractory myelofibrosis. In addition, there are several Phase 1 and\nPhase 2 clinical trials being conducted in myelofibrosis by various companies, including a Phase 2 study of a deuterated form of momelotinib being run by Zelgen Biopharmaceuticals in China. Several additional companies are advancing assets in the early stages of development potentially for the myelofibrosis market. If momelotinib is approved, it will compete with existing therapies for the indication or indications for which it is approved. While we believe that momelotinib may have the ability to provide an anemia benefit in addition to treating the other manifestations of myelofibrosis, which we believe is unique within the JAK inhibitor class of agents, the market for momelotinib is competitive, and physicians and other prescribers may not recommend or prescribe momelotinib over competing products.\nTo our knowledge, there are no approved drugs that specifically target BET inhibitors. BMS, Incyte, Morphosys and AbbVie are all developing BET inhibitors as monotherapy or in combination with approved JAK inhibitors, across various stages of clinical development. Plexxicon and Zenith Epigenetics are also developing BET inhibitors in combination for solid and hematological malignancies. To our knowledge, SRA515 is the only bivalent, BRD4 specific inhibitor in clinical development. If SRA515 is approved, it will compete with existing therapies and currently marketed drugs for the indication or indications for which it is approved.\nTo our knowledge, there are no approved drugs that specifically target Chk1 on the market, but there are a number of competitors in clinical development, at a similar stage of development or more advanced than us. To our knowledge, Esperas Pharma is conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of an oral Chk1 inhibitor as monotherapy and in combination with gemcitabine in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer. Acrivon Therapeutics recently in-licensed the Chk1/Chk2 inhibitor ACR-368 (formally prexasertib) from Eli Lilly and intends to develop in various solid tumors. There are also preclinical programs focused on developing Chk1 inhibitors. If SRA737 is approved, it will compete with existing therapies and currently marketed drugs for the indication or indications for which it is approved.\nMany of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial and other resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the hematology and oncology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our momelotinib program. Development efforts and clinical results of other companies may be unsuccessful or terminated, which could result in a negative perception of momelotinib, decreases in our stock price and adverse regulatory impacts, which could have a material and adverse effect on our ongoing development programs and our business.\nOur commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if any competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any drugs that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or foreign regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors who may place restrictions on patient access to our drugs in seeking to encourage the use of generic or cheaper drugs. If we fail to compete effectively, our business and operating results would be harmed.\nWe are dependent on our key personnel, and if we are not successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy.\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive oncology industry depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific and medical personnel. We have in the past and may in the future continue to experience changes in our executive management team resulting from the departure of executives or subsequent hiring of new executives, which may be disruptive to our business. Any changes in business strategies can create uncertainty, may negatively impact our ability to execute our business strategy and advance development, and may ultimately be unsuccessful. The impact of hiring new executives may not be immediately realized. We are substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing management, scientific and medical personnel,\nincluding Dr. Stephen Dilly, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Dr. Barbara Klencke, our Chief Medical Officer, because of their familiarity with momelotinib and our development efforts. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers, other key employees and other scientific and medical advisors, including due to illness resulting from COVID-19, and our inability to find suitable replacements, could result in delays in product development and harm our business.\nOur operations are conducted in regions where significant competition exists for key personnel and employees. Many other oncology companies and academic and research institutions are located in these regions. Competition for skilled personnel in these markets is intense and may limit our ability to hire and retain highly qualified personnel on acceptable terms or at all.\nTo induce valuable employees to remain at our company, in addition to salary and cash incentives, we have provided stock options that vest over time. The value to employees of stock options that vest over time may be significantly affected by movements in our stock price that are beyond our control and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. Despite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management, scientific and development teams may terminate their employment with us on short notice. Although we have employment agreements with our key employees, these employment agreements provide for at-will employment, which means that any of our employees could leave our employment at any time, with or without notice. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies on the lives of these individuals or the lives of any of our other employees.\nShould momelotinib receive marketing approval in the United States, Canada, or elsewhere in the world, we would need to hire a substantial number of specialized personnel, including field-based personnel, unless we were to collaborate with a third party to commercialize momelotinib. If we are responsible for commercializing momelotinib, we would need to increase our administrative headcount to support such expanded development and commercialization operations with respect to momelotinib. Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future is subject to intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses and our current financial position. The loss of the services of any of our senior management could delay or prevent the development and commercialization of momelotinib or have other adverse effects on our business for an indefinite term. In particular, if we lose any members of our current senior management team, we may not be able to find suitable replacements in a timely fashion, if at all, and our business may be harmed as a result.\nWe may encounter difficulties in managing our expected growth and in expanding our operations successfully.\nPrior to acquiring momelotinib, our most advanced product candidate was in Phase 1/2 development. Advancing momelotinib, if approved, through commercialization will require us to develop or expand our regulatory, manufacturing, medical affairs, marketing and sales capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us. If approved, we must also successfully integrate the employees and operations related to the commercialization of momelotinib. Maintaining additional relationships and managing our future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of our management. We must be able to manage our development efforts effectively, manage our clinical trials effectively, hire, train and integrate additional management, development, medical affairs, administrative and sales and marketing personnel, improve our managerial, development, operational and finance systems, and expand our facilities, all of which may impose a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure. Our future financial performance will depend, in part, on our ability to manage this growth effectively. Even after regulatory approval, we may not be able to accomplish these tasks, failure of which could prevent us from successfully commercializing momelotinib.\nIf we are unable to adequately prepare the market for the potential future commercialization of a product, we may not be able to generate product revenue once marketing authorization is obtained. We are currently establishing our marketing and sales organization and have limited experience in marketing products. If we are unable to successfully establish marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell momelotinib or any future product candidates, we may not be able to generate product revenue.\nWe have substantial preparations remaining to be ready for potential future commercialization, and currently have limited commercialization expertise, including no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities and no experience in marketing products. Advancing momelotinib to potential approval will require us to begin commercialization\npreparation activities and incur related expenses before we obtain final trial results and know whether MOMENTUM will support regulatory approval. These activities will include, among other things, the development of an in-house marketing organization and sales force, which will require significant capital expenditures, management resources and time. We will have to compete with other companies to recruit, hire, train and retain qualified marketing and sales personnel. If we are unable to adequately prepare the market for the potential future commercialization of a product, we may not be able to generate product revenue once marketing authorization is obtained.\nAdditionally, if we are unable or decide not to establish internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we will pursue collaborative arrangements regarding the sales and marketing of our products, however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain such collaborative arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or if we are able to do so, that they will have effective sales forces. Any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, which may not be successful. We may have little or no control over the marketing and sales efforts of such third parties and our revenue from product sales may be lower than if we had commercialized momelotinib or any future product candidates ourselves. We also face competition in our search for third parties to assist us with the sales and marketing efforts of momelotinib.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to develop in-house commercialization expertise, including sales and distribution capabilities, or establish or maintain relationships with third-party collaborators to commercialize any product in the United States or overseas.\nWe depend on our information technology and infrastructure.\nWe rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of information technology systems, including mobile technologies, to manage our operations, to process, transmit and store financial and non-financial information, and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. We also depend on our information technology infrastructure for communications among our personnel, contractors, consultants and vendors. System failures or outages, including any potential disruptions due to significantly increased global demand on certain cloud based systems during the COVID-19 situation, could compromise our ability to perform these functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business or delay our financial reporting. Such failures could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, we depend on third parties to operate and support our information technology systems. These third parties vary from multi-disciplined to boutique providers, and they may have access to our technology infrastructure, systems and our confidential information. Many of these third parties subcontract or outsource some of their responsibilities to other third parties. As a result, our information technology systems, including those functions that are performed by third parties who are involved with or have access to our systems, are very large and complex. Failure by any of these third-party providers to adequately deliver the contracted services, or maintain confidentiality and adequate security controls, could have an adverse effect on our business, which in turn may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Although we take measures designed to prevent security breaches and cyberattacks, these efforts may not completely eliminate the risk of such incidents and we cannot guarantee security incidents will not impact us in the future. We may need to continuously increase cost and resources to protect security threats and their consequences. If our information technology systems were to fail or be breached, such failure or breach could materially adversely affect our ability to perform critical business functions and sensitive and confidential data could be compromised.\nOur internal information technology systems, or those used by our CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches and other security incidents.\nDespite our efforts to implement effective administrative, technical, and physical security measures and controls, our internal information technology systems and those of our CROs and other contractors and consultants may become vulnerable to damage and other impacts from security breaches and other incidents and/or unauthorized access, use, and disclosure of protected health information (PHI) and other data. The prevalent use of mobile devices also increases the risk of data security breaches and incidents resulting from lost or stolen devices or compromised security controls. In the ordinary course of our business, we and our CROs and other contractors and consultants collect, store, process and transmit large amounts of sensitive information, including intellectual property,\nproprietary business information, personal information, health information, financial information, and other confidential information. It is critical that we and our CROs and other contractors and consultants do so in a secure manner in order to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of such sensitive information. We and certain of our CROs and other contractors and consultants have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, a security breach or other security incident. When we have experienced security breaches in the past, we took action designed to prevent additional unauthorized access, put further security controls in place where appropriate and worked with outside counsel for any necessary reporting requirements. Any material system failure or security breach or incident could cause interruptions in our operations and could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of data from completed or future preclinical studies or clinical trials could result in significant delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on other third parties for the manufacture of momelotinib and to conduct studies and trials, and similar events relating to their information technology systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach or incident were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate access to, or use, acquisition, or disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, including personal and sensitive information, we could incur liability and the commercialization of momelotinib could be significantly delayed.\nUnstable or unfavorable global market and economic conditions may have adverse consequences on our business, financial condition and stock price.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. Global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions in the past several years, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. We cannot assure you that further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will not occur. Our general business strategy and stock price may be adversely affected by any such economic downturn, volatile business environment or large-scale unpredictable or unstable market conditions, including a prolonged government shutdown, conflict between Russia and Ukraine or as a result of a global pandemic such as the COVID-19 pandemic. While the potential economic impact brought by and the duration of the pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, it has already caused and could result in further, significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital either at all or on favorable terms. In addition, a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nIf the current equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, financial performance and stock price and could require us to delay or abandon development plans. In addition, there is a risk that one or more of our current service providers, manufacturers and other partners may not survive difficult economic times, which could directly affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget.\nOur employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other illegal activity by our employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners and vendors. Misconduct by such individuals could include intentional failures to comply with FDA or international regulations, provide accurate information to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, comply with manufacturing standards, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data timely, completely and accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Misconduct by third parties could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials.\nWe have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent inappropriate conduct may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements will comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. In addition, the approval and commercialization of momelotinib outside the United States will also likely subject us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws.\nEven if approved, our product candidates may not achieve adequate market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may not gain adequate market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community. The degree of market acceptance of any of our approved product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy and safety profile as demonstrated in clinical trials compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe timing of market introduction of the product candidate as well as competitive products;\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which the product candidate is approved;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the use of our product candidates, such as boxed warnings or contraindications in labeling, or a REMS, if any, which may not be required of alternative treatments and competitor products;\n\u2022\nthe potential and perceived advantages of product candidates over alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\npricing and the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors, including government authorities and patients\u2019 willingness to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of such coverage and adequate reimbursement;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nunfavorable publicity relating to our products or product candidates or similar approved products or product candidates in development by third parties; and\n\u2022\nthe approval of other new therapies for the same indications.\nIf any of our product candidates is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, hospitals, healthcare payors and patients, we may not generate or derive sufficient revenue from that product candidate and our financial results could be negatively impacted.\nWe have never commercialized a product candidate before and may lack the necessary expertise, personnel and resources to successfully commercialize any products on our own or together with suitable collaborators.\nWe have never commercialized a product candidate. We may license certain rights with respect to our product candidates to collaborators, and, if so, we will rely on the assistance and guidance of those collaborators. For product candidates for which we retain commercialization rights and marketing approval, we will have to develop our own sales, marketing and supply organization or outsource these activities to a third party.\nFactors that may affect our ability to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, on our own include recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel, developing adequate educational and marketing programs to increase public acceptance of our approved product candidates, ensuring regulatory compliance of our company, employees and third parties under applicable healthcare laws, and other unforeseen costs associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization. Developing a sales and marketing organization will be expensive and time-consuming and could delay the launch of our product candidates upon approval. We may not be able to build an effective sales and marketing organization. If we are unable to build our own distribution and marketing capabilities or to find suitable partners for the commercialization of our product candidates, we may not generate revenues from them or be able to reach or sustain profitability.\nIf the market opportunity for any product candidate that we develop is smaller than we believe, our revenue may be adversely affected, and our business may suffer.\nWe intend to initially focus our product candidate development on treatments for various oncology indications, including myelofibrosis. The addressable patient populations that may benefit from treatment with our product candidates, if approved, are based on our estimates. These estimates, which have been derived from a variety of sources, including scientific literature, surveys of clinics, patient foundations and market research, may prove to be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases. Any regulatory approval of our product candidates would be limited to the therapeutic indications examined in our clinical trials and as determined by the FDA, which would not permit us to market our products for any other therapeutic indications not expressly approved by the FDA. Additionally, the potentially addressable patient population for our product candidates may not ultimately be amenable to treatment with our product candidates. Even if we receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, such approval could be conditioned upon label restrictions that materially limit the addressable patient population. Our market opportunity may also be limited by future competitor treatments that enter the market. If any of our estimates prove to be inaccurate, the market opportunity for any product candidate that we or our strategic partners develop could be significantly diminished and have an adverse material impact on our business.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of momelotinib.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the testing of momelotinib and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize any products. For example, we may be sued if momelotinib causes or is perceived to cause injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of momelotinib. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for momelotinib;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\ninitiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u2022\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\na diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue;\n\u2022\nexhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources;\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize momelotinib; and\n\u2022\na decline in our stock price.\nWe currently hold liability insurance coverage, but that coverage may not be adequate to cover any and all liabilities that we may incur. We would need to increase our insurance coverage when we begin the commercialization of momelotinib, if ever. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nA variety of risks associated with marketing our product candidates internationally may materially adversely affect our business.\nWe plan to eventually seek regulatory approval of our product candidates outside of the United States and, accordingly, we expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries if we obtain the necessary approvals, including:\n\u2022\ndiffering regulatory requirements in foreign countries, such as the lack of pathways for accelerated drug approval, may result in foreign regulatory approvals taking longer and being more costly than obtaining approval in the United States;\n\u2022\nforeign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design, implementation or results of our clinical trials or our interpretation of data from nonclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\napproval policies or regulations of foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval;\n\u2022\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ability to produce our product candidates and conduct clinical trials in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets including as a result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine;\n\u2022\ncompliance with legal requirements applicable to privacy, data protection, information security and other matters;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022\ndifficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ncomplexities associated with managing multiple payor reimbursement regimes and government payors in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022\npotential liability under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 or comparable foreign regulations;\n\u2022\nchallenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\nThese and other risks associated with international operations may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or maintain profitable operations.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be significantly limited, or entirely restricted.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had gross U.S. federal operating loss carryforwards of $52.7 million that are eligible for an indefinite carryforward, and gross state operating loss carryforwards of $51.8 million, expiring in years ranging from 2022 to 2041. We also had U.S. net tax credit carryforwards of $11.2 million which begin to expire in 2039 and net tax credit carryforwards in a foreign jurisdiction of $0.8 million which begin to expire in 2039. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d generally occurs if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by \u201c5% stockholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws.\nWe have experienced ownership changes in the past, including in 2017 and 2019, and as a result of common stock issuances and changes in the stock ownership that occurred subsequent to 2019, an ownership change under Section 382 is deemed to have occurred during the first quarter of 2022. As such, certain tax attributes existing as of the date of the ownership changes may not be available for future use. The loss or ultimate limitation of these attributes will not have any impact on the financial statements since our net U.S. deferred tax assets are offset by a full valuation allowance. We may experience additional ownership changes in the future as a result of future transactions in our stock, some of which may be outside our control. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards, or other pre-change tax attributes, to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income and taxes may be subject to limitations. We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities, which could adversely impact our operating results.\nUnder the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as modified by the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act, or the Tax Act, U.S. federal net operating losses arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such U.S. federal net operating losses in any particular taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020 is limited to 80% of that years taxable income.\nChanges in U.S. and foreign tax laws, as well as the application of such laws, could adversely impact our financial position and operating results.\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in certain U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. All of these jurisdictions have in the past and may in the future make changes to their corporate income tax rates and other income tax laws which could adversely affect our future income tax provision. For example, our future income tax obligations could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, by changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof, including changes with possible retroactive application or effect. Further, U.S. federal, state and local, as well as international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable, there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge. If we are unsuccessful in such a challenge, the relevant tax authorities may assess additional\ntaxes, which could result in adjustments to, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly, which may cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly fluctuations. Our net loss and other operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nvariations in the level of expense related to development programs;\n\u2022\nresults of preclinical studies and clinical trials, or the addition or termination of preclinical studies, clinical trials or funding support;\n\u2022\nthe timing of the release of results from any preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of milestone and royalty payments;\n\u2022\nchanges in the competitive landscape or market opportunity for momelotinib;\n\u2022\nour execution of any new collaboration, licensing or similar arrangement, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under such existing or future arrangements or the termination or modification of any such existing or future arrangements;\n\u2022\nany intellectual property infringement lawsuit or opposition, interference or cancellation proceeding in which we may become involved;\n\u2022\nany securities or other litigation in which we may become involved;\n\u2022\nadditions and departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nstrategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures,\n\u2022\nstrategic investments or changes in business strategy;\n\u2022\nthe receipt of regulatory approval for momelotinib, and market acceptance and demand for momelotinib;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments affecting momelotinib or those of our competitors; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general market and economic conditions, including global pandemics such as COVID-19.\nIf our quarterly operating results or expected results from development of momelotinib fall outside the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nWe may be unable to obtain U.S. or foreign regulatory approval of momelotinib, and, as a result, we may be unable to commercialize momelotinib. Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in one jurisdiction does not mean that we will be successful in obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in other jurisdictions.\nMomelotinib is, and any future product candidates that we may develop will be, subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to, among other things, research, testing, development, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, approval, recordkeeping, import, export, reporting, labeling, storage, packaging, advertising and promotion, pricing, marketing, distribution, import and export of drugs. Rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process are required to be successfully completed before a new drug can be marketed in the United States and in many foreign jurisdictions. Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly,\ntime-consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays. It is possible that none of the product candidates we may develop will obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for us or our collaborators to begin selling them.\nAs a company, we have very limited experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, including approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, and, as a company, we have no experience in obtaining approval of any product candidates. The time required to obtain FDA and other approvals is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the initiation of clinical trials, depending upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate. We may encounter delays or rejections during any stage of the regulatory review and approval process based upon the failure of clinical or laboratory data to demonstrate compliance with, or upon the failure of the product candidates to meet, the FDA\u2019s or foreign regulatory authorities\u2019 requirements for safety, efficacy and quality.\nThe standards that the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities use when regulating us are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. Because the product candidates we are developing or may develop may represent a new class of drug, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities have not yet established any definitive policies, practices or guidelines in relation to these drugs. The lack of policies, practices or guidelines may hinder or slow review by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities of any regulatory filings that we may submit. Moreover, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may respond to these submissions by defining requirements we may not have anticipated. Such responses could lead to significant delays in the development of any product candidates.\nAny analysis we perform of data from preclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. We may also encounter unexpected delays or increased costs due to new government regulations, for example, from future legislation or administrative action, or from changes in FDA or foreign regulatory authority policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and regulatory review. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA or foreign regulatory authority, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.\nIn addition, the FDA and/or foreign regulatory authorities may delay, limit, or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials, including our statistical plan;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for any indication;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe results of our clinical trials may not demonstrate the safety or efficacy required by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for approval;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate the integrity of the clinical trial data to the satisfaction of the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate the proper conduct of the clinical trial at all clinical trial sites, by our vendors, and by the Sponsor to the satisfaction of the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nwe may encounter difficulties coming to agreement with the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities on a pediatric investigation or study plan or may encounter difficulties meeting the terms of the plan, once agreed;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may find deficiencies in our manufacturing processes or facilities;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may lack resources or are delayed in conduct pre-approval inspections due to reasons related to COVID-19; and\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s or foreign regulatory authorities\u2019 approval policies or regulations may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\n\u2022\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may differ on the appropriate indication for commercial use of current drugs under investigation.\nEven if we comply with all of the regulatory requirements of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, we may not obtain regulatory approval for momelotinib. If we fail to obtain regulatory approval for momelotinib, we will have no commercialized products and correspondingly no revenue.\nIn addition, because there may be approved treatments for some of the diseases for which we may seek approval, in order to receive regulatory approval, we may need to demonstrate through clinical trials that the product candidates we develop to treat these diseases, if any, are not only safe and effective, but safer or more effective than existing products. Furthermore, in recent years, there has been increased public and political pressure on the FDA with respect to the approval process for new drugs, and the FDA\u2019s standards, especially regarding drug safety, appear to have become more stringent.\nAny delay or failure in obtaining required approvals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues from the particular product candidate for which we are seeking approval. Furthermore, any regulatory approval to market a product may be subject to limitations on the approved uses for which we may market the product or the labeling or other restrictions. In addition, the FDA has the authority to require a REMS plan as part of or after approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved product, such as limiting prescribing to certain physicians or medical centers that have undergone specialized training, limiting treatment to patients who meet certain safe-use criteria and requiring treated patients to enroll in a registry. These limitations and restrictions may limit the size of the market for the product and affect reimbursement by third-party payors.\nIf we or any collaborators, manufacturers or service providers fail to comply with applicable federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions, which could affect our ability to develop, market and sell our products successfully and could harm our reputation and lead to reduced acceptance of our products by the market. These enforcement actions include, among others:\n\u2022\nadverse regulatory inspection findings;\n\u2022\nwarning letters;\n\u2022\nvoluntary or mandatory product recalls or public notification or medical product safety alerts to healthcare professionals;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on, or prohibitions against, marketing our products;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on, or prohibitions against, importation or exportation of our products;\n\u2022\nsuspension of review or refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;\n\u2022\nexclusion from participation in government-funded healthcare programs;\n\u2022\nexclusion from eligibility for the award of government contracts for our products;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of product approvals;\n\u2022\nproduct seizures;\n\u2022\ninjunctions; and\n\u2022\ncivil and criminal penalties and fines.\nWe are also subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and third-party reimbursement. The foreign regulatory approval process varies among countries and may include all of the risks associated with FDA approval described above as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of local regulations in foreign jurisdictions. Moreover, the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities outside the United States and vice versa.\nIn Europe, the implementation of the Clinical Trials Regulation depends on confirmation of full functionality of the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS) through an independent audit, which commenced in September 2020. The system is currently planned to go live in December 2021. The new clinical trial portal and database will be maintained by the EMA in collaboration with the European Commission and the European Union Member States. The objectives of the new regulation include consistent rules for conducting trials throughout the European Union, consistent data standards and adverse events listing, and consistent information on the authorization status. Information on the conduct and results of each clinical trial carried out in the European Union will be made publicly available.\nIn addition, a new pan-European clinical trial data information database has been created that will be complementary to the database established for pharmacovigilance (Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 with respect to centrally authorized medicinal products). In addition, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 520/2012 outlines the practical implications for marketing authorization holders, national competent authorities, and the EMA. Also, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 357/2014 on post-authorization efficacy studies specifies the situations in which such studies may be required. Post-authorization efficacy studies may be required where concerns relating to some aspects of efficacy of the medicinal product are identified and can be resolved only after the medicinal product has been marketed, or where the understanding of the disease, the clinical methodology or the use of the medicinal product under real-life conditions indicate that previous efficacy evaluations might have to be revised significantly.\nBrexit is also expected to disrupt the operation of pre- and post-authorization clinical trial infrastructure. The rules around GMP and pharmacovigilance in the UK currently remain similar to the EU requirements. However, the Falsified Medicines Directive will not apply in Great Britain though it is likely that the UK will implement a procedure to minimize the risk of falsified medicines.\nUncertainty in the regulatory framework and future legislation can lead to disruption in the execution of international multi-center clinical trials, the monitoring of adverse events in through pharmacovigilance programs, the evaluation of the benefit-risk profiles of new medicinal products, and determination of marketing authorization across different jurisdictions. There could also be disruption to the supply and distribution as well as the import/export both of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and finished product. Such a disruption could create supply difficulties for ongoing clinical trials and may damage the integrity of the pharmacovigilance database for the safety of new products.\nThe cumulative effects of the disruption to the regulatory framework, uncertainty in future regulation, and changes to existing regulations may add considerably to the development lead time to marketing authorization and commercialization of products in the European Union and/or the United Kingdom and increase our costs. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and future regulation on our business or the results of our operations.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval of any product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our product candidates.\nAny regulatory approvals that we receive for any product candidates we may develop will require surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate, and may require us to conduct post-approval clinical studies. The FDA may also require a REMS in order to approve momelotinib or any future product candidates, which could entail requirements for a medication guide, physician communication plans or additional elements to ensure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. In addition, if the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority approves momelotinib, the manufacturing processes, labeling,\npackaging, distribution, AE reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, import, export and recordkeeping for momelotinib will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMPs and GCPs for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval.\nMoreover, if we obtain regulatory approval for momelotinib, we will only be permitted to market our products for the indication approved by FDA or foreign regulatory authority, and such approval may involve limitations on the indicated uses or promotional claims we may make for our products, or otherwise not permit labeling that sufficiently differentiates momelotinib from competitive products with comparable therapeutic profiles. For example, we will not be able to claim that our products have fewer side effects, or improve compliance or efficacy unless we can demonstrate those attributes to FDA or foreign regulatory authority in comparative clinical trials. Communications that occur prior to obtaining regulatory approval for momelotinib could also be considered promotional and thus may also be subject to certain FDA or foreign regulatory authority requirements.\nLater discovery of previously unknown problems with momelotinib, including adverse effects of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of momelotinib, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing delays and supply disruptions where regulatory inspections identify observations of noncompliance requiring remediation;\n\u2022\nrevisions to the labeling, including limitation on approved uses or the addition of additional warnings, contraindications or other safety information, including boxed warnings;\n\u2022\nimposition of a REMS, which may include distribution or use restrictions;\n\u2022\nrequirements to conduct additional post-market clinical trials to assess the safety of the product;\n\u2022\nfines, warning letters, or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nholds on clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefusal by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or suspension or revocation of license approvals;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of momelotinib; and\n\u2022\ninjunctions, the imposition of civil penalties or criminal prosecution.\nThe FDA\u2019s and foreign regulatory authorities\u2019 policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained, and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nMoreover, the FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about drug products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenue and could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity.\nA Fast Track designation by the FDA, as granted for momelotinib or if granted for any future product candidates, may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and does not increase the likelihood that such product candidates will receive marketing approval.\nIf a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition, the drug sponsor may apply for FDA Fast Track designation for a particular indication. Marketing applications filed by sponsors of products in Fast Track development may qualify for priority review under the policies and procedures offered by the FDA, but the Fast Track designation does not assure any such qualification or ultimate marketing approval by the FDA. We previously announced that the FDA had granted Fast Track designation to momelotinib for the treatment of patients with intermediate/high-risk myelofibrosis who have previously received a JAK inhibitor. Receipt of Fast Track designation may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures. In addition, the FDA may withdraw any Fast Track designation at any time if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program. We may seek Fast Track designation for any future product candidates, but there is no assurance that the FDA will grant this status to any future proposed product candidates.\nIf we or any of our independent contractors, consultants, collaborators, manufacturers, vendors or service providers fail to comply with healthcare, privacy and data security laws and regulations, we or they could be subject to enforcement actions, which could result in significant penalties and affect our ability to develop, market and sell momelotinib or any future product candidates and may harm our reputation.\nWe are or may in the future be subject to federal, state, and foreign healthcare, privacy and data security laws and regulations pertaining to, among other things, fraud and abuse, data protection and patients\u2019 rights. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual for a healthcare item or service, or the purchasing or ordering of an item or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid;\n\u2022\nthe U.S. federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented, claims for payment by government funded programs such as Medicare or Medicaid that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to us by virtue of statements and representations made to customers or third parties;\n\u2022\nthe U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud healthcare programs;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), which imposes requirements on certain types of people and entities relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable PHI, and requires notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of PHI;\n\u2022\nthe federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) information related to payments and other transfers of value to covered recipients, including physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare providers (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members, which is published in a searchable form on an annual basis; and\n\u2022\nstate laws comparable to each of the above federal laws, such as, for example, anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope and also apply to commercial insurers and other non-federal payors, requirements for mandatory corporate regulatory compliance programs, and laws relating to\npatient data privacy and security. Other state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state and foreign laws govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIn the European Union (EU), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) established new and expanded operational requirements for entities that process, or control personal data generated in the EU, including consent requirements for disclosing the way personal information will be used, information retention requirements, notification requirements in the event of a data breach, and other requirements. In addition, the GDPR imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland to the United States. These obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other requirements or our practices. Recent developments have also created uncertainty regarding the rules around such data transfers.\nAny actual or alleged violation of the GDPR could result in regulatory investigations and other proceedings, reputational damage, orders to cease or change our processing of our data, enforcement notices, or assessment notices (for a compulsory audit). We may also face civil claims including representative actions and other class action type litigation (where individuals have suffered harm), potentially amounting to significant compensation or damages liabilities, as well as associated costs, diversion of internal resources, and reputational harm. Additionally, following the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union, the UK is a \u201cthird country\u201d under the GDPR. In particular, we face exposure in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom under two parallel regimes, each with the power to impose fines up to the greater of either 4% of total global annual revenue, or \u20ac20 million (for the EU) or \u00a317.5 million (for the United Kingdom). We may incur liabilities, expenses, costs, and other operational losses under the GDPR, and applicable laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection of EU member states and the United Kingdom, in connection with any measures we take to comply with them.\nIn July 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield as a mechanism for managing personal data transfers between the EU and the U.S. and onward to other countries. Additionally, in September 2020, the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland opined that the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield did not provide an adequate level of protection for data transfers from Switzerland to the U.S. pursuant to Swiss data protection law. While the CJEU upheld the adequacy of EU-specified standard contractual clauses (SCCs), a form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate data transfer mechanism, the CJEU made clear that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances and that their use must be assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into account the surveillance laws and right of individuals in the U.S and other onward countries. EU regulators released new SCCs in June 2021 that are required to be implemented over time. Data protection authorities may require measures to be put in place in addition to the SCCs for transfers to countries outside of the EEA, as well as Switzerland and the United Kingdom.\nWe are currently certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield with respect to our transfer of certain personal data from the EEA to the U.S. We are, however, in the process of updating the mechanisms we currently use to transfer personal data from the EEA and the United Kingdom to the U.S., and any additional mechanisms that may be required to maintain adequate safeguards for personal data transfer, including in light of the new SCCs issued by the European Commission on June 4, 2021. As a result, we may be unsuccessful in maintaining appropriate compliance mechanisms for our transfer and receipt of personal data from the EEA or the United Kingdom and to the U.S. and may be at risk of experiencing reluctance or refusal of European or multi-national partners, clinical trial sites or other third parties with whom we do business and incurring potential regulatory penalties, which may have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nAs developments continue with respect to personal data transfers, we could suffer additional costs, complaints, or regulatory fines, investigations, or other proceedings, and if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, and could adversely affect\nour financial results. We also may be required to engage in new contract negotiations with third parties that aid in processing data on our behalf.\nIn the United States, state and federal lawmakers and regulatory authorities have increased their attention on the collection and use of personal information. In the United States, non-sensitive personal information generally may be used under current rules and regulations, subject to certain restrictions, so long as the person does not affirmatively \u201copt-out\u201d of the collection or use of such data. If an \u201copt-in\u201d model or additional required \u201copt-outs\u201d, were to be adopted in the United States, less data would be available, and the cost of data would be higher. For example, California enacted the CCPA, which gives California residents new rights to access and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is collected, used, and shared. Further, in November 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). The CPRA, which will take effect on January 1, 2023 and creates obligations with respect to certain data relating to consumers as of January 1, 2022, significantly expands the CCPA, including by introducing additional obligations such as data minimization and storage limitations, granting additional rights to consumers, such as correction of personal information and additional opt-out rights, and creates a new entity, the California Privacy Protection Agency, to implement and enforce the law. The CCPA and CPRA present many unresolved compliance complexities. The CCPA and CPRA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. In addition to the CCPA, numerous other states\u2019 legislatures are considering similar laws that will require ongoing compliance efforts and investment. For example, in March 2021, Virginia enacted a Consumer Data Protection Act that will go into effect on January 1, 2023 and in June 2021, Colorado enacted a Colorado Privacy Act that will go into effect on July 1, 2023, both of which share similarities with the CCPA, CPRA, and legislation proposed in other states.\nAdditionally, if our operations are found to be in violation of any such health care, privacy and data security laws and regulations, we may be subject to significant penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, monetary damages, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, fees from regulators, fines, significant settlements or judgments resulting from the CCPA\u2019s private right of action, or exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, any of which could adversely impact our financial results. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for an alleged or suspected violation by a private party or governmental agency could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, adversely impact our reputation, and could divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business, even if our defense is successful. In addition, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations may be costly to us in terms of money, time and resources.\nThe insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved products is uncertain. Any products we develop may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party coverage and reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, thereby harming our business.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new drugs vary widely from country to country. Many countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. The pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted in most cases. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. Although we intend to monitor these regulations, we are currently unable to assess the full impact of such price regulations on our momelotinib program. As a result, we might obtain regulatory approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country.\nOur ability to commercialize any products successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors. In many jurisdictions, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that jurisdiction. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to the payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-\neffectiveness data for the use of our products. If we are not currently capturing the scientific and clinical data that will be required for reimbursement approval, we may be required to conduct additional trials, which may delay or suspend reimbursement approval. Additionally, in the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of momelotinib to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.\nA primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. In many countries, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In general, the prices of medicines under such systems are substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for products may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenue and profits.\nIn the United States and markets in other countries, patients generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors is critical to new product acceptance. Even if we succeed in bringing one or more products to the market, these products may not be considered cost-effective, and the amount reimbursed for any products may be insufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis. Because our programs are still in clinical development, we are unable at this time to determine their cost effectiveness or the likely level or method of reimbursement. Increasingly, the third-party payors, such as government and private insurance plans, who reimburse patients or healthcare providers, are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices, and are seeking to reduce the prices charged or the amounts reimbursed for pharmaceutical products. If the level of reimbursement provided for any products we develop is inadequate in light of our development and other costs, our return on investment could be adversely affected.\nThe Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to patients with disabilities and seniors. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs, such as momelotinib, if approved. Medicare Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee.\nWe may face difficulties from changes to current regulations and future legislation. Healthcare legislative measures aimed at reducing healthcare costs may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates or any future product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell a product for which we obtain marketing approval. Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example:\n\u2022\nchanges to our manufacturing arrangements;\n\u2022\nadditions or modifications to product labeling;\n\u2022\nthe recall or discontinuation of our products; or\n\u2022\nadditional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.\nOur revenue prospects could be affected by changes in healthcare spending and policy in the United States and abroad. We operate in a highly regulated industry and new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to healthcare availability, the method of delivery or payment for healthcare products and services could negatively impact our business, operations and financial condition.\nThere have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future, including revisions to the PPACA. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare and/or impose price controls may adversely affect:\n\u2022\nthe demand for our product candidates, if we obtain regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nour ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain coverage and reimbursement approval for a product;\n\u2022\nour ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability;\n\u2022\nthe level of taxes that we are required to pay; and\n\u2022\nthe availability of capital.\nAny reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors, which may adversely affect our future profitability.\nFurther, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the PPACA) substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and continues to significantly impact the pharmaceutical industry in the United States. There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. For example, On June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the PPACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress. Thus, the PPACA will remain in effect in its current form. Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the PPACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the PPACA. It is possible that the PPACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the PPACA and our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. For example, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 also amended the PPACA, effective January 1, 2019, by increasing the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and closing the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole.\u201d The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or ATRA, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Other legislative changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, will remain in effect through 2031 with the exception of a temporary suspension implemented under various COVID-19 relief legislation from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester.\nThere has also been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Presidential executive orders, Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, in 2020, under the Trump administration, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and CMS issued various rules that were expected to impact, among others, price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, importation of prescription drugs from Canada and other countries, manufacturer price reporting requirements under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including regulations that affect manufacturer-sponsored patient assistance programs subject to pharmacy benefit manager accumulator programs and Best Price reporting related to certain value-based purchasing arrangements. Multiple lawsuits have been brought against the HHS challenging various aspects of these new rules. As a result, the Biden administration and HHS have delayed the implementation or published rules rescinding some of these Trump-era policies. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, \u201cPromoting Competition in the American Economy,\u201d with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden\u2019s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. Pursuant to the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, effective January 1, 2024, the statutory cap on Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rebates that manufacturers pay to state Medicaid programs will be eliminated. Elimination of this cap may require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay more in rebates than it receives on the sale of approved products, which could have a material impact on our business. Further, Congress is considering legislation that, if passed, could have significant impact on prices of prescription drugs covered by Medicare, including limitations on drug price increases and allowing Medicare to negotiate pricing for certain covered drugs. The impact of these and future reform measures on us and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole is unclear. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our product candidates if approved.\nAt the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs.\nWe expect that the PPACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for biotechnology products. We cannot be sure to what extent these and future legislative and regulatory efforts, whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. A number of states are considering or have recently enacted state drug price transparency and reporting laws that could substantially increase our compliance burdens and expose us to greater liability under such state laws once we begin commercialization if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our products. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand or additional pricing pressures on any of our products that may receive regulatory approval.\nDisruptions at the FDA, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other government agencies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent new or modified products from being developed, approved or commercialized in a timely manner or at all, or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes, and other events that may otherwise affect the FDA\u2019s ability to perform routine functions. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and other government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, in recent years, including in 2018 and 2019, the U.S. government shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the SEC, had to furlough critical employees and stop critical activities. Separately, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, since March 2020 when foreign and domestic inspections of facilities were largely placed on hold, the FDA has been working to resume routine surveillance, bioresearch monitoring and pre-approval inspections on a prioritized basis. The FDA has developed a rating system to assist in determining when and where it is safest to conduct prioritized domestic inspections. In 2020 and 2021, a number of companies announced receipt of complete response letters due to the FDA\u2019s inability to complete required inspections for their applications. As of May 26, 2021, the FDA noted it was continuing to ensure timely reviews of applications for medical products during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in line with its user fee performance goals and conducting mission critical domestic and foreign inspections to ensure compliance of manufacturing facilities with FDA Good Manufacturing Practices. However, the FDA may not be able to continue its current inspection pace, and review timelines could be extended, including where a pre-approval inspection or an inspection of clinical sites is required and due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and travel restrictions, the FDA is unable to complete such required inspections during the review period. We cannot ensure that FDA or any other regulatory authority will conduct a timely pre-approval inspection of our manufacturing sites or clinical trial sites, which could significantly delay approval of our product candidates. Regulatory authorities outside the U.S. may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and may experience delays in their regulatory activities. In the event of any prolonged government shutdown or other disruption, or if global health concerns continue to prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities on a timely basis, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, future government shutdowns, disruptions or delays could impact our ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for momelotinib or any future product candidates in one jurisdiction does not mean that we will be successful in obtaining regulatory approval of any of our product candidates in other jurisdictions.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for momelotinib or any future product candidates in one jurisdiction does not guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain regulatory approval in any other jurisdiction, while a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. For example, even if the FDA grants marketing approval for a product candidate, comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions must also approve the manufacturing, marketing and promotion of the product candidate in those countries. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials as clinical trials conducted in one jurisdiction may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that jurisdiction. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for our products is also subject to approval.\nWe may also submit marketing applications in other countries. Regulatory authorities in jurisdictions outside of the United States have requirements for approval of product candidates with which we must comply prior to marketing in those jurisdictions. Obtaining foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in certain countries. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets or receive applicable marketing approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of momelotinib or any future product candidates will be harmed.\nIf we or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including chemical and biological materials, by ourselves and our third-party manufacturers. Our manufacturers are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations in the United States and abroad governing laboratory procedures and the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of medical and hazardous materials. Although we believe that our manufacturers\u2019 procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from medical or hazardous materials. As a result of any such contamination or injury, we may incur liability or local, city, state or federal authorities may curtail the use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines, and the liability could exceed our resources. We do not have any insurance for liabilities arising from medical or hazardous materials. Compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses, we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nWe are subject to certain U.S. and foreign anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions, and other trade laws and regulations. We can face serious consequences for violations.\nAmong other matters, U.S. and foreign anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions, and other trade laws and regulations, which are collectively referred to as Trade Laws, prohibit companies and their employees, agents, clinical research organizations, legal counsel, accountants, consultants, contractors, and other partners from authorizing, promising, offering, providing, soliciting, or receiving directly or indirectly, corrupt or improper payments or anything else of value to or from recipients in the public or private sector. Violations of trade laws can result in substantial criminal fines and civil penalties, imprisonment, the loss of trade privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences. We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities, and other organizations. We also expect our non-U.S. activities to increase in time. We plan to engage third parties for clinical trials and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations, and other regulatory approvals and we can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our personnel, agents, or partners, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have prior knowledge of such activities.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could increase our tax burden and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIn December 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation referred to as the Tax Act that includes significant changes to the taxation of business entities. These changes include, among others, (i) a permanent reduction to the corporate income tax rate, (ii) revisions to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards, (iii) a partial limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense, and (iv) a shift of the U.S. taxation of multinational corporations from a tax on worldwide income to a participation exemption system (along with certain rules designed to prevent erosion of the U.S. income tax base).\nIn addition, beginning in 2022, the tax act will require U.S. research and experimental expenditures to be capitalized and amortized ratably over a five-year period. Any such expenditures attributable to research conducted outside the U.S. must be capitalized and amortized over a 15-year period. Further, the Tax Act, among other things, reduces the orphan drug credit from 50% to 25% of qualifying expenditures. When and if we become profitable, this amortization of research and experimental expenditures and reduction in orphan drug tax credits may result in an increased federal income tax burden, as it may cause us to pay federal income taxes earlier under the revised tax law than under the prior law and, despite being partially off-set by a reduction in the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, may increase our total federal tax liability.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are not able to obtain and enforce patent protection for our technologies or momelotinib, development and commercialization of our product candidates may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other forms of intellectual property rights, including in-licenses of intellectual property rights of others, methods used to manufacture momelotinib and methods for treating patients using momelotinib, as well as our ability to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others.\nWe and our future licensors and licensees may not be able to apply for or prosecute patents on certain aspects of momelotinib or our technologies at a reasonable cost in a timely fashion or at all. It is also possible that we or our current licensors, or any future licensors or licensees, will fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. Therefore, our patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. It is possible that defects of form in the preparation or filing of our patents or patent applications may exist, or may arise in the future, such as with respect to proper priority claims, inventorship, claim scope or patent term adjustments. If our current licensors, or any future licensors or licensees, are not fully cooperative or disagree with us as to the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of any patent rights, such patent rights could be compromised and we might not be able to prevent third parties from making, using, and selling competing products. If there are material defects in the form or preparation of our patents or patent applications, such patents or applications may be invalid and unenforceable. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods, and know-how. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThere is no guarantee that any of our pending patent applications will result in issued or granted patents, that any of our issued or granted patents will not later be found to be invalid or unenforceable or that any issued or granted patents will include claims that are sufficiently broad to cover momelotinib, methods for treating patients using momelotinib or our technologies for manufacturing momelotinib or to provide meaningful protection from our competitors. Moreover, the patent position of oncology companies can be highly uncertain because it involves complex legal and factual questions. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our current and future proprietary technology and momelotinib are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. If third parties disclose or misappropriate our proprietary rights, it may materially and adversely impact our position in the market.\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent process. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case. The standards applied by the USPTO and foreign patent offices in granting patents are not always applied uniformly or predictably. For example, there is no uniform worldwide policy regarding patentable subject matter or the scope of claims allowable in oncology patents. Moreover, changes in either the patent laws or in the interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. As such, we do not know the degree of future protection that we will have on our proprietary products and technology. While we will endeavor to try to protect momelotinib with intellectual property rights such as patents, as appropriate, the process of obtaining patents is time-consuming, expensive and sometimes unpredictable.\nFurther, patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed (or 20 years after the filing date of the first non-provisional US patent application to which it claims priority). Various extensions may be available; however, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Without patent protection for momelotinib, we may be open to competition from generic versions of momelotinib. Further, the extensive period of time between patent filing and regulatory approval for a product candidate limits the time during which we can market a product candidate under patent protection, which may particularly affect the profitability of momelotinib.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patent protection for certain aspects of momelotinib and our technologies, we also consider trade secrets, including confidential and unpatented know-how important to the maintenance of our competitive position. We protect trade secrets and confidential and unpatented know-how, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to such knowledge, such as our employees, outside scientific collaborators, CROs, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to maintain confidentiality and assign their inventions to us.\nDespite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nWe are also subject both in the United States and outside the United States to various regulatory schemes regarding requests for the information we provide to regulatory authorities, which may include, in whole or in part, trade secrets or confidential commercial information. While we are likely to be notified in advance of any disclosure of such information and would likely object to such disclosure, there can be no assurance our challenge to the request would be successful.\nChanges in patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect momelotinib.\nNumerous recent changes to the patent laws and proposed changes to the rules of the USPTO may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. For example, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA) enacted in 2011 involves significant changes in patent legislation. An important change introduced by the AIA is that, as of March 16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after that date but\nbefore us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by the third party. This will require us to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to filing of a patent application.\nFurther, the Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, some of which cases either narrow the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weaken the rights of patent owners in certain situations. These changes have led to increasing uncertainty with regard to the scope and value of our issued patents and to our ability to obtain patents in the future.\nAmong some of the other changes introduced by the AIA are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and providing opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO. This applies to all of our U.S. patents, even those issued before March 16, 2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in United States federal court necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action.\nDepending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the U.S. federal courts, the USPTO or similar authorities in foreign jurisdictions, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that may weaken our and our licensors\u2019 ability to obtain new patents or to enforce existing patents we and our licensors or partners may obtain in the future.\nOnce granted, patents may remain open to opposition, interference, re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, nullification derivation and opposition proceedings in court or before patent offices or similar proceedings for a given period after allowance or grant, during which time third parties can raise objections against such initial grant. In the course of such proceedings, which may continue for a protracted period of time, the patent owner may be compelled to limit the scope of the allowed or granted claims thus attacked, or may lose the allowed or granted claims altogether.\nIf we do not obtain patent term extension and data exclusivity for any therapeutic candidate or product we may develop, our business may be materially harmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of any FDA marketing approval of any therapeutic candidate or product we may develop, one or more of our patents for momelotinib or our or in-licensed U.S. patents for our technologies may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Hatch-Waxman Act). The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar extensions as compensation for patent term lost during regulatory review processes are also available in certain foreign countries and territories, such as in Europe under a Supplementary Patent Certificate. However, we may not be granted an extension in the United States and/or foreign countries and territories because of, for example, failing to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failing to list eligible patents in the OrangeBook with the FDA within applicable deadlines, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents, or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is shorter than what we request, our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects could be materially harmed.\nWe or any future strategic partners may become subject to third-party claims or litigation alleging infringement of patents or other proprietary rights or seeking to invalidate patents or other proprietary rights.\nWe or any future strategic partners may be subject to third-party claims for infringement or misappropriation of patent or other proprietary rights that prevent us from developing and commercializing our products. If we, our licensors or any future strategic partners are found to infringe a third-party patent or other intellectual property rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages, potentially including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed. In addition, we or any future strategic partners may choose to seek, or be required to seek, a license from a third party, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if a license can be obtained on acceptable terms, the rights may be non-exclusive, which could give our competitors access to the same technology or intellectual property rights licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license, we may be unable to effectively market product candidates, which could limit our ability to generate revenue or achieve profitability and possibly prevent us from generating revenue sufficient to sustain our operations. Alternatively, we may need to redesign our infringing products, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. In addition, we may find it necessary to pursue claims or initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patent or other intellectual property rights. The cost to us in defending or initiating any litigation or other proceeding relating to patent or other proprietary rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and litigation would divert our management\u2019s attention. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could delay our research and development efforts and limit our ability to continue our operations.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. If we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our products or our technology, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, for example, lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on one or more of our products or certain aspects of our platform technology. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business. Patents and other intellectual property rights also will not protect our technology if competitors design around our protected technology without legally infringing our patents or other intellectual property rights.\nIn addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business.\nInterference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors. An unfavorable outcome could result in a loss of our current patent rights and could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Litigation or interference proceedings may result in a decision adverse to our interests and, even if we are successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of\nour trade secrets or confidential information, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nWe have limited foreign intellectual property rights and may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nWe and our licensors or future licensors and licensees have limited intellectual property rights outside the United States. Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions.\nCompetitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to oncology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under our strategic agreements, we may be required to pay damages.\nIn connection with our acquisition of momelotinib from Gilead, we are required to make aggregate milestone payments of up to $190.0 million to Gilead upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones, including a milestone payment of $25.0 million due upon the approval of momelotinib from the FDA, as well as low double-digit to high-teens percent tiered combined royalties based upon net sales and additional tiered milestone payments upon reaching certain sales milestones. If we breach any of these obligations, we may be required to indemnify the Seller, subject to certain limitations set forth in the momelotinib purchase.\nUnder our license agreement with AstraZeneca for SRA515 (formerly AZD5153) and related compounds, the Company has agreed to pay AstraZeneca up to $208.0 million upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones, and a tiered royalty on worldwide net sales ranging from high single-digits to low double-digits. If we breach any of our obligations under this agreement, we may be subject to damages.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nWe have received confidential and proprietary information from third parties. In addition, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other oncology companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of these third parties or our employees\u2019 former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and employees.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. Any trademark litigation could be expensive. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names or may be forced to stop using these names, which we need for name recognition by potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. If we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, we may not be able to compete effectively, and our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and you may be unable to sell your shares at or above the price at which you purchased them.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. For example, we experienced a significant decrease in our stock price after we announced the suspension of the development of our former lead product candidate PNT2258 and the DNAi platform in June 2016 and after we announced the preliminary clinical data from our two Phase 1/2 studies of SRA737 in June 2019. In addition, the trading prices for our common stock and other biopharmaceutical companies have been highly volatile as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Factors affecting the market price of our common stock include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe success of existing or new competitive products;\n\u2022\nthe timing and results of development activities related to our product candidates;\n\u2022\nour capital requirements, financings and the related dilution;\n\u2022\nthe commencement, enrollment or results of future clinical trials we may conduct, or changes in the development status of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nany delay in our regulatory filings for our product candidates including momelotinib and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the applicable regulatory authority\u2019s review of such filings;\n\u2022\nany disputes with Gilead regarding our acquisition of momelotinib and assumption of the related clinical trials;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to acquire or in-license new product candidates to grow our pipeline;\n\u2022\nadverse results or delays in preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our product candidates including momelotinib, including but not limited to clinical trial requirements for approvals;\n\u2022\nadverse developments concerning our manufacturers;\n\u2022\nour inability to obtain adequate product supply for any approved product or inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022\nour inability to establish collaborations if needed, or to out-license our product candidates including momelotinib or technologies on favorable terms or at all;\n\u2022\nour failure to commercialize our product candidates including momelotinib;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u2022\nunanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of our product candidates including momelotinib;\n\u2022\nthe size and growth of our initial target markets;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully treat additional types of cancers or at different stages;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nour failure to meet the estimates and projections of the investment community or that we may otherwise provide to the public;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us or our industry, or immunotherapy in particular, or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\noverall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future;\n\u2022\nthe low trading volume and limited public market for our common stock;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nsignificant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u2022\nactions instituted by activist shareholders or others;\n\u2022\ngeneral political and economic conditions, including global pandemics such as COVID-19 or the conflict between Russia and Ukraine;\n\u2022\nfiscal and monetary stimulus measures to counteract the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and oncology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Securities class action litigation is often instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. For example, we have previously vigorously defended purported securities class action lawsuits against us and certain of our executive officers. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business, operating results or financial condition.\nMarket volatility arising from the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to increased shareholder activism if we experience a market valuation that they believe are not reflective of their intrinsic value. Activist campaigns that contest or conflict with our strategic direction or seek changes in the composition of our board of directors could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nThe issuance or sale of shares of our common stock, or rights to acquire shares of our common stock could depress the trading price of our common stock.\nWe may conduct future offerings of our common stock, preferred stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common stock to finance our operations or fund acquisitions, or for other purposes. For example, in November 2019, we conducted a public equity offering where we raised net proceeds of approximately $97.7 million in a substantially dilutive transaction to our pre-existing investors. In August 2020, we filed a prospectus supplement pursuant to which we issued and sold $20.0 million of our common stock in ATM offerings. In February 2021, we filed a prospectus supplement pursuant to which we can issue and sell an aggregate of up to an additional $30.0 million of our common stock from time to time in ATM offerings. In addition, on May 7, 2021, we filed a prospectus supplement, pursuant to which we can issue and sell an aggregate of up to an additional $50.0 million of our common stock from time to time in ATM offerings. Also, on November 5, 2021, we filed a prospectus supplement, pursuant to which we can issue and sell an aggregate of up to an additional $50.0 million of our common stock from time to time in the ATM offerings. As of December 31, 2021, we sold 5,049,720 shares under the ATM Program (including the amounts sold under the prospectus supplement filed in August 2020) for net proceeds of $87.1 million, net of commissions and offering expenses. As of December 31, 2021, there was $59.6 million under the ATM program. In addition, in January 2022, we completed an underwritten public offering of 4,074,075 shares of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 925,925 shares of our common stock. As part of the underwritten public offering, in February 2022, we issued an additional 750,000 shares of common stock representing the underwriters\u2019 full exercise of their over-allotment option. If we issue additional shares of our common stock or rights to acquire shares of our common stock, if any of our existing stockholders sells a substantial amount of our common stock, or if the market perceives that such issuances or sales may occur, then the trading price of our common stock, and, accordingly, the trading price of our common stock may significantly decrease. In addition, our issuance of additional shares of common stock, including upon exercise of our outstanding warrants, will dilute the ownership interests of our existing common stockholders.\nWe have a significant number of outstanding warrants which may cause significant dilution to our stockholders, have a material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock, make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future equity offerings and discourage an acquisition of us by a third party.\nAs more fully described in Note 8 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the subheading \u201cCommon Stock Warrants,\u201d we issued Series A warrants and Series B warrants in connection with our November 2019 public offering of Series A Preferred Stock and warrants to Gilead pursuant to the amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement.\nAlthough certain of the warrants have been exercised as detailed in Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, to the extent additional warrants are exercised, additional shares of common stock will be issued and such issuance may dilute existing stockholders and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our shares. In addition, the perceived risk of dilution as a result of the significant number of outstanding warrants may cause our common stockholders to be more inclined to sell their shares, which would contribute to a downward movement in the price of our common stock. Moreover, the perceived risk of dilution and the resulting downward pressure on our common stock price could encourage investors to engage in short sales of our common stock, which could further contribute to price declines in our common stock. The fact that our warrant holders can sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate, or at all.\nTo the extent we issue shares of common stock to effect a business combination, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares upon exercise of our warrants could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle in the eyes of a target business since the exercise of warrants could reduce the value of the shares issued to complete the business combination. Accordingly, our warrants may make it more difficult to effectuate a business combination or increase the cost of acquiring the target business.\nFurther, our warrants could make the structuring of any strategic transaction more complex and affect the terms of any such strategic transaction. In connection with certain \u201cfundamental transactions\u201d involving a change in control\nof our company, the surviving entity is required to either (1) assume all of our obligations under the warrants or (2) deliver in connection with the closing of a fundamental transaction in exchange for the cancellation of the warrants, consideration equal in value to the Black-Scholes value of the remaining unexercised portion of the warrants, with an assumed volatility of 100%. These provisions could deter a third party from acquiring us even where the acquisition could be beneficial to you. Any negotiated alternative to such treatment of the warrants would require the approval of the holders of warrants exercisable for the majority of the shares underlying the warrants. Three of our ten directors are affiliated with investors that hold a majority-in-interest of the Series A warrants. The holders of warrants could exercise their rights under the warrants in a manner that benefits their interests relative to the holders of common stock generally.\nWe incur significantly increased costs and devote substantial management time as a result of operating as a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the stock exchange upon which our common stock is listed and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. However, these rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.\nPursuant to Section 404, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. However, while we remain a non-accelerated filer, we will not be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period, we are engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that we will not be able to conclude, within the prescribed timeframe or at all, that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404.\nWe have in the past and may in the future identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting. Under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or personnel, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. We cannot assure you that there will not be additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies that our independent registered public accounting firm or we will identify. If we identify such issues or if we are unable to produce accurate and timely financial statements, our stock price may be adversely affected and we may be unable to maintain compliance with the Nasdaq Stock Market listing requirements.\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions, among other things:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time;\n\u2022\npermit only the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill vacancies on the board;\n\u2022\nprovide that directors may only be removed \u201cfor cause\u201d and only with the approval of two-thirds of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nrequire super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d);\n\u2022\neliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit cumulative voting; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock.\nSection 22 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. In April 2020, we amended and restated our restated bylaws to provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act (a Federal Forum Provision). Our decision to adopt a Federal Forum Provision followed a decision by the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware holding that such provisions are facially valid under Delaware law. While there can be no assurance that federal or state courts will follow the holding of the Delaware Supreme Court or determine that the Federal Forum Provision should be enforced in a particular case, application of the Federal Forum Provision means that suits brought by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act must be brought in federal court and cannot be brought in state court.\nSection 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. In addition, neither the exclusive forum provision nor the Federal Forum Provision applies to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Accordingly, actions by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder must be brought in federal court.\nOur stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to our exclusive forum provisions, including the Federal Forum Provision. These provisions may limit a stockholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of their choosing for disputes\nwith us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees.\nCertain of our 5% stockholders in the aggregate hold a majority of the voting power and may therefore, in effect, be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our executive officers, directors and 5% stockholders collectively beneficially owned a majority of our outstanding voting shares. Four of our current directors are each affiliates of certain 5% stockholders. As of December 31, 2021, these 5% stockholders beneficially own 84.6% of the voting power of our company. Therefore, if such holders acted in concert, these holders may have the ability to influence us through their ownership position and through representation on our board of directors. For example, numerically, these holders may be able to determine the outcome of votes with respect to elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. They also have contractual rights under the warrants that they may exercise in a manner that adversely impacts the interest of holders of capital stock that do not hold warrants. This concentrated ownership may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or momelotinib.\nWe may seek additional capital through a combination of public and private equity offerings, debt financings, strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements. In November 2019 we conducted a public equity offering where we raised net proceeds of approximately $97.7 million in a substantially dilutive transaction to our pre-existing investors. In August 2020, we filed a prospectus supplement pursuant to which we issued and sold $20.0 million of our common stock. In February 2021, we filed a prospectus supplement pursuant to which we can issue and sell an aggregate of up to $30.0 million of our common stock from time to time in ATM offerings. In addition, on May 7, 2021, we filed a prospectus supplement, pursuant to which we can issue and sell an aggregate of up to an additional $50.0 million of our common stock from time to time in the ATM offerings. Also, on November 5, 2021, we filed a prospectus supplement, pursuant to which we can issue and sell an aggregate of up to an additional $50.0 million of our common stock from time to time in the ATM offerings. As of December 31, 2021, we sold 5,049,720 shares under the ATM Program (including the amounts sold under the prospectus supplement filed in August 2020) for net proceeds of $87.1 million, net of commissions and offering expenses. As of December 31, 2021, there was $59.6 million under the ATM program. In addition, in January 2022, we completed an underwritten public offering of 4,074,075 shares of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 925,925 shares of our common stock. As part of the underwritten public offering, in February 2022, we issued an additional 750,000 shares of common stock representing the underwriters\u2019 full exercise of their over-allotment option. The shares of common stock and the pre-funded warrants were offered at a price of $27.00 and $26.999 per shares, respectively. The aggregate net proceeds from the offering were $145.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our stockholders will be further diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could involve certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or momelotinib or grant licenses on terms unfavorable to us.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. These sales, or the perception in the market that our officers, directors or the holders of a large number of shares of our common stock intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. Our directors, executive officers and certain stockholders affiliated with our directors entered into lock-up agreements in connection with the recent underwritten offering. However, we cannot predict what effect, if any, sales of our shares in the public market or the availability of shares for sale will have on the market price of our common stock. Future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including shares issued upon exercise of outstanding options, or the perception that such sales may occur, however, could adversely\naffect the market price of our common stock and also could adversely affect our future ability to raise capital through the sale of our common stock or other equity-related securities of ours at times and prices we believe appropriate. Additionally, our stockholders may be further diluted by the exercise of the pre-funded warrants we issued earlier this year.\nShares of our common stock are subordinate to any preferred stock we may issue and to any current and future indebtedness.\nShares of our common stock rank junior to any shares of our preferred stock that we may issue in the future and to any future indebtedness we may incur, as well as to all creditor claims and other non-equity claims against us and our assets available to satisfy claims on us, including claims in a bankruptcy or similar proceeding. Any future indebtedness and preferred stock may restrict, payment of dividends on our common stock.\nFurthermore, unlike indebtedness, where principal and interest customarily are payable on specified due dates, in the case of our common stock, (i) dividends are payable only when and if declared by our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of our board of directors, and (ii) as a corporation, we are restricted to making dividend payments and redemption payments out of legally available assets. We have never paid a dividend on our common stock and have no current intention to pay dividends in the future. Furthermore, our common stock places no restrictions on our business or operations or on our ability to incur indebtedness or engage in any transactions, subject only to the voting rights available to our shareholders generally.\nGeneral Risks\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our information technology systems from cyberattacks and other security breaches or incidents, which could result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation, and subject us to significant financial and legal exposure.\nMaintaining the security of our computer information systems and communication systems is a critical issue and we devote considerable internal and external resources to maintaining the security and protection of our systems, but no security measures can provide absolute security. The complexity of our computer systems may make them vulnerable to service interruption, breaches of security, disruption of data integrity, inadvertent errors that expose our data or systems, malicious intrusion, or random attacks. Likewise, privacy or data security incidents or intentional or non-malicious breaches by employees or others may pose a risk that sensitive data, including our intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information we maintain may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public, or that risk of loss or misuse of this information could occur, resulting in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nCyberattacks upon systems, across industries, are increasing in their frequency, persistence, and sophistication, and are being conducted by sophisticated, well-funded, and organized groups and individuals. These cyberattacks may occur on our systems or those of our CROs or other third-party providers or partners. Additionally, certain threats are designed to remain dormant or undetectable until launched against a target and we may not be able to implement adequate preventative measures. Such cyberattacks could include wrongful conduct by hostile foreign governments, industrial espionage, the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware attacks, denial-of-service, and/or other means to threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. Those engaging in attacks may implement social engineering techniques to induce our employees or contractors to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain improper access to data or systems. Further, we engage third-party service providers to store and otherwise process sensitive and personal information, including our CROs. Our CROs and other service providers and partners face substantial risks of security breaches and incidents. Security breaches and other security incidents may result from malfeasance, error or negligence of our employees, contractors, CROs or other service providers or partners. A successful cyberattack could cause serious negative consequences for us, including, without limitation, the disruption of operations, the loss or misappropriation of confidential business information and trade secrets, unauthorized access to or other compromise of personal information or other sensitive information, and the disclosure of corporate strategic plans. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, a compromise of our data or information technology systems, or one or more other events, including employee or contractor error or malfeasance, that results in unauthorized access to, or acquisition, use, or disclosure of,\nconfidential or proprietary information about our company or sensitive information about individuals, such as employees or clinical trial participants, including PHI and other types of personal information. There can be no assurance that our cybersecurity protection efforts will prevent information security breaches or incidents we or those who maintain or process data on our behalf, including CROs and other contractors and consultants, may suffer that would result in business, legal or reputational harm to us, or would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. We also may be required to incur significant costs in an effort to detect and prevent security breaches and other security-related incidents. Confidential information obtained by third parties in connection with past or future attacks could be used in ways that adversely affect our company or our stockholders.\nAlso, the majority of our workforce works remotely rather than in our offices, and we may be more susceptible to security breaches and incidents as a result. Our service providers may be more susceptible to security breaches and other security incidents while social distancing measures restrict the ability of their employees to work at offices to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Depending on the nature of any information compromised, in the event of a data breach or other unauthorized access to our sensitive information, we may also have obligations to notify affected individuals and regulators about the incident, and we may be required or find it appropriate to provide some form of remedy, such as a subscription to credit monitoring services, pay significant fines to one or more regulators, or pay compensation in connection with a class-action settlement.\nWhile our insurance policies include liability coverage for certain of these matters, subject to applicable deductibles, our insurance coverage might not be adequate for data handling or data security liabilities actually incurred, such insurance may not continue to be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms, or at all, and insurers may deny us coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations, and those of our CROs and other contractors and consultants, could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemic, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other natural or man-made disasters or business interruptions, for which we may not have insurance coverage. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. In particular, the potential effects on our business due to the COVID-19 pandemic may be significant and could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition. We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce and process momelotinib. Our ability to obtain supplies of momelotinib could be disrupted if the operations of these suppliers are affected by a man-made or natural disaster or other business interruption. Our corporate headquarters are located in San Mateo, California, which is near a major earthquake fault. Our operations and financial condition could suffer in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster near any of our locations.\nWe face risks related to securities litigation that could result in significant legal expenses and settlement or damage awards.\nWe have in the past and may in the future become subject to claims and litigation alleging violations of the securities laws or other related claims, which could harm our business and require us to incur significant costs. Any future litigation may require significant attention from management and could result in significant legal expenses, settlement costs or damage awards that could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in interpretation or application of generally accepted accounting principles may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe prepare our financial statements to conform to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. These principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission\nand various other regulatory or accounting bodies. A change in interpretations of, or our application of, these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced. Additionally, as we are required to adopt new accounting standards, our methods of accounting for certain items may change, which could cause our results of operations to fluctuate from period to period.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the securities or industry analysts who publish research about us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable evaluations of our company or our stock, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, our stock may lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.", "PERMNO": 15507, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "SRRA"}
