Risk Factors\nYou should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K or in any other of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, liquidity and results of operations. In evaluating us, you should consider carefully, among other things, the factors and the specific risks set forth below. This annual report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" in this annual report on Form 10-K. Some of the following risks relate principally to the industry in which we operate and to our business. Other risks relate principally to the securities markets and ownership of our common shares. If any of the following risks develop into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected, the trading price of your shares could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Our Business\nOil and natural gas prices are volatile. Volatility in oil and natural gas prices can adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. This volatility also makes valuation of oil and natural gas producing properties difficult and can disrupt markets.\nOil and natural gas prices have historically been, and are likely to continue to be, volatile. Oil and natural gas prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Some of the factors that cause these fluctuations are:\n\u2022 demand for oil and natural gas, which is affected by worldwide population growth, economic development and general economic and business conditions;\n\u2022 the levels and location of natural gas and oil supply and demand and expectations regarding supply and demand, including the potential long-term impact of an abundance of natural gas from shale plays in the United States on the global natural gas supply;\n\u2022 political and economic uncertainty and socio-political unrest;\n\u2022 the price and quality of foreign imports of oil and natural gas; political and economic conditions in oil and natural gas producing countries, especially the Middle East, Africa, Russia and South America;\n\u2022 the willingness and ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\"OPEC\") to set and maintain oil price and production controls;\n\u2022 the level of domestic and international exploration, drilling and production activity;\n\u2022 the level of global inventories;\n\u2022 the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u2022 the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering, transportation, processing and/or refining facilities in regional or localized areas that may affect the realized price for natural gas and oil;\n\u2022 weather conditions and changes in weather patterns;\n\u2022 the price and availability of, and demand for, competing energy sources, including coal, liquefied natural gas, and alternative energy sources;\n\u2022 the extent to which natural gas markets in the United States become integrated with global natural gas markets through the approval and development of infrastructure supporting the export of liquefied and other natural gas;\n\u2022 technological advances affecting energy consumption and production;\n\u2022 the nature and extent of governmental regulation and taxation, including environmental regulations affecting competing energy sources as well as natural gas;\n\u2022 risks associated with operating drilling rigs; and\n\u2022 variations between product prices at sales points and applicable index prices.\nAdditionally, continuance of the current lower natural gas price environment, further declines in natural gas prices and the lack of natural gas storage may have the following effects on our business:\n\u2022 reduction of our revenues, operating income and cash flows;\n\u2022 curtailment or shut-in of our natural gas production due to lack of transportation or storage capacity;\n\u2022 cause certain of our properties to become economically unviable;\n\u2022 cause material or significant reductions in our capital investment programs, resulting in a failure to develop our natural gas reserves; and\n\u2022 limit our financial condition, liquidity, and/or ability to finance planned capital expenditures and operations.\nThe long-term effects of these and other conditions on the prices of oil and natural gas are uncertain. Price volatility makes it difficult to budget and project the return on exploration and development projects involving our oil and natural gas properties and to estimate with precision the value of producing properties that we may own or propose to acquire. In addition, unusually volatile prices often disrupt the market for oil and natural gas properties as buyers and sellers have more difficulty agreeing on the purchase price of properties. Our cash flow and results of operations depend to a great extent on the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas. Our annual and quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of, among other things, variations in oil and natural gas prices and production performance. In recent years, oil and natural gas price volatility has become\nincreasingly severe, and continuing volatility may have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, among the assets that we acquired in 2014 from Citrus as part of our expansion into the Marcellus Shale is a natural gas supply agreement with a subsidiary of Procter and Gamble. During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, approximately 38% and 27.8%, respectively, of Citrus' production was sold pursuant to this agreement. During these same periods, the prices that Citrus received for production under this contract generally were higher than the prices Citrus received for natural gas from other third parties. The customer has elected to terminate the agreement effective June 10, 2015. While we are in discussions with the customer to renew or extend the agreement, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so or that the price secured under the contract will be advantageous compared to market pricing at the time of sale. If we are unable to renew or extend the agreement, or if we negotiate a price that is lower than what is ultimately available in the open market, our revenues may be unfavorably impacted.\nSignificant declines in oil and natural gas prices would adversely affect our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligation and financial commitments, and our financial results, cash flows, access to capital and ability to grow.\nOur revenues, operating results, cash flow, profitability and future rate of growth depend upon the prevailing prices of, and demand for, oil and natural gas. All of our operating revenues are derived from the sale of our oil and natural gas production. A continuing substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and commitments, our results of operations, our access to capital and the quantities of oil and natural gas that may be economically produced by us. A significant decrease in price levels for an extended period negatively affects us in several ways including:\n\u2022 our cash flow will be reduced, which will decrease funds available for capital investments employed to replace reserves, increase production and operate our properties;\n\u2022 certain reserves will no longer be economic to produce, resulting in lower proved reserves and cash flow and charges to earnings that impair the value of these assets; and\n\u2022 access to other sources of capital, such as bank loans and equity or debt markets, could be severely limited or unavailable.\nBased on oil and natural gas prices in recent years, our oil and natural gas revenues may from time to time decrease and negatively impact our liquidity. Our current plans to address lower oil and natural gas prices are primarily to reduce capital expenditures to a level equal to cash flow from operations, reduce operating expenses and seek additional capital financing. However, our plans may not be successful in improving our results of operations and liquidity. If oil or natural gas prices remain suppressed, or further decline, for extended periods of time, we might not be able to generate enough cash flow from operations to meet our obligations and make planned capital expenditures, which could impair our liquidity and our ability to develop and operate our properties.\nOur Credit Facility and the indenture governing our Senior Notes contain operating and financial restrictions that may restrict our business and financing activities.\nOur Credit Facility and the indenture governing our Senior Notes (the \"Indenture\") contain, and any future indebtedness we incur may contain, a number of restrictive covenants that will impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022 sell assets, including equity interests in our subsidiaries;\n\u2022 pay distributions on, redeem or repurchase our common stock or redeem or repurchase our subordinated debt;\n\u2022 incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock;\n\u2022 create or incur certain liens;\n\u2022 make certain acquisitions and investments;\n\u2022 redeem or prepay other debt;\n\u2022 enter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us;\n\u2022 consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022 engage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022 create unrestricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022 enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and\n\u2022 engage in certain business activities.\nAs a result of these covenants, we will be limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\nOur ability to comply with some of the covenants and restrictions contained in our Credit Facility and the Indenture may be affected by events beyond our control. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. For example, continuation of low oil and gas prices or their further deterioration could significantly reduce cash flow, which is critical to these covenants.\nAvailability under our Credit Facility depends on a borrowing base which is subject to redetermination by our lenders. If our borrowing base is reduced, we may be required to repay amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nUnder the terms of our Revolving Credit Facility, our borrowing base is subject to semi-annual redetermination by our lenders based on their evaluation of our proved reserves and their internal criteria. In addition, under certain circumstances, interim redeterminations may be conducted. The significant recent decline in oil and gas prices has resulted in banks reducing the price decks upon which borrowing bases are set. Our current borrowing base was set using a price deck significantly higher than the current price deck used by the lending institutions in our syndicate. Therefore, it is likely that our borrowing base will be reduced, perhaps significantly, in the regular semi-annual redetermination upcoming at the end of March 2015.\nA failure to comply with the covenants, ratios or tests in our Credit Facility, the Indenture or any future indebtedness could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If an event of default under our Credit Facility occurs and remains uncured, the lenders:\n\u2022 would not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;\n\u2022 could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable;\n\u2022 may have the ability to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings; or\n\u2022 may prevent us from making debt service payments under our other agreements.\nOur proved reserves are estimates based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nNo one can measure underground accumulations of oil and natural gas in an exact way. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves, including many factors beyond our control that could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated. Oil and natural gas reserve engineering requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil and natural gas and assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices, production levels, operating and development costs, drilling expenses, severance and excise taxes, capital expenditures, ownership and title matters, taxes and the availability of funds. The engineering process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex and is not an exact science. It requires interpretations of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Therefore, these estimates are inherently imprecise.\nEstimates of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of expected timing and future net cash flows prepared or audited by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary substantially. Because of the subjective nature of oil and natural gas reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the amounts or other factors estimated:\n\u2022 The amount and timing of oil and natural gas production;\n\u2022 The revenues and costs associated with that production; and\n\u2022 The amount and timing of future development expenditures.\nOver time, our independent petroleum engineering consultants may make material changes to reserve estimates by taking into account the results of actual drilling, testing, and production. Further, the potential for future reserve revisions, either upward or downward, is significantly greater than normal because a significant portion of our potential reserves are undeveloped.\nIn accordance with SEC requirements, our estimates of proved reserves for 2014 were determined based on a historical 12-month average price as of the first day of each month during the fiscal year. As a result, the full effect of falling prices during the second half of 2014 are not reflected. In a given year, actual prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than those used to calculate our estimated proved reserves. Significant variance from these prices and costs could greatly affect our estimates of reserves. In addition, proved undeveloped reserves locations may be limited to those scheduled to be drilled within the next five years.\nAs of December 31, 2014 and 2013, approximately 41% and 36%, respectively, of our estimated net proved reserves were undeveloped. Undeveloped reserves, by their nature, are less certain. Recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. Additionally, as oil and natural gas commodity prices become lower, the quantity of economically recoverable proved reserves declines. The reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop our reserves. We have prepared estimates of our oil and natural gas reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards. However, the estimated costs may not be accurate, development may not occur as scheduled, or the actual results may not be as estimated. We may not have, or be able to obtain, the capital we need to develop these proved reserves.\nActual oil and natural gas prices, future production, revenues, operating expenses, taxes, development expenditures and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will most likely vary from those estimated. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of future net revenues set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K. A reduction in oil and natural gas prices, for example, would reduce the value of proved reserves and reduce the amount\nof oil and natural gas that could be economically produced, thereby reducing the quantity of reserves. We may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net revenues referred to in this annual report on Form 10-K is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. The Standardized Measure is a reporting convention that provides a common basis for comparing oil and natural gas companies subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Our non-GAAP financial measure, PV-10 Value, is a similar reporting convention that we have disclosed in this annual report on Form 10-K. In accordance with SEC requirements, the standardized measure of estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on average twelve-month prices and costs as of the first day of each month during the fiscal year. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than such prices and costs. Any change in consumption by oil and natural gas purchasers or in governmental regulations or taxation will also affect actual future net cash flows. The timing of both the production and the expenses for the development and production of our oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor, nor does it reflect discount factors used in the marketplace for the purchase and sale of oil and natural gas properties. Conditions in the oil and natural gas industry and oil and natural gas prices will affect whether the 10% discount factor accurately reflects the market value of our estimated reserves.\nWe may not be able to drill wells on a substantial portion of our acreage.\nWe may not be able to drill on a substantial portion of our acreage for various reasons. We may not generate or be able to raise sufficient capital to do so. Deterioration in commodities pricing may also make drilling some acreage uneconomic. Our actual drilling activities and future drilling budget will depend on drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, lease expirations, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, regulatory approvals and other factors. In addition, any drilling activities we are able to conduct may not be successful or add additional proved reserves to our overall proved reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nOur exploration, development, production and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state and local levels. Under these laws and regulations, we could be held liable for personal injuries, property damage (including site clean-up and restoration costs), and other damages. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may also result in the suspension or termination of our operations, or subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties and damages.\nEnvironmental and other governmental laws and regulations also increase the costs to plan, permit, design, drill, install, operate and abandon oil and natural gas wells. Moreover, public interest in environmental protection has increased in recent years, and environmental organizations have opposed, with some success, certain drilling projects. Compliance costs are significant. The exploration and production of oil and gas involves many risks concerning equipment and human operational problems that could lead to leaks or spills of petroleum products. These laws and regulations, particularly in California, Pennsylvania and Wyoming, are extensive, involve severe penalties and could change in ways that substantially increase our costs and associated liabilities. As a result, there can be no assurance\nthat our anticipated production levels will be realized or that our estimates of proved reserves will not be negatively impacted.\nPart of the regulatory environment in which we operate includes, in some cases, federal and state requirements for performing or preparing environmental assessments, environmental impact statements, studies, reports and/or plans of development before commencing exploration and production activities. These regulations may impose significant costs and delays on our operations and, as a result, may hinder or limit the quantity of oil and natural gas we may ultimately be able to produce and sell.\nA major risk inherent in our drilling plans is the need to obtain drilling permits from applicable federal, state and local authorities. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or drilling permits for producing and water injection wells, the failure to obtain a drilling permit for a well, or the receipt of a permit with excessive conditions or costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to explore or develop our properties. Additionally, the oil and natural gas regulatory environment could change in ways that might substantially increase the financial and managerial costs to comply with the requirements of these laws and regulations and, consequently, adversely affect our profitability. Furthermore, we may be put at a competitive disadvantage to larger companies in our industry that can spread these additional costs over a greater number of wells and larger operating area. Any or all of these contingencies could delay or halt our drilling activities or the construction of ancillary facilities necessary for production, which would prevent us from developing our property interests as planned. Conditions, delays or restrictions imposed on the management of groundwater produced during drilling could severely limit our operations or make them uneconomic.\nWe cannot be certain that existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, or future laws or regulations will not harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our operations are subject to regulation and permitting in various aspects, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 drilling permits;\n\u2022 water discharge and disposal permits for drilling operations;\n\u2022 the amounts and types of substances and materials that may be released into the environment;\n\u2022 drilling and operating bonds;\n\u2022 environmental matters and reclamation;\n\u2022 spacing of wells;\n\u2022 the permitting and use of underground injection wells, which affects the disposal of water from our wells;\n\u2022 occupational safety and health;\n\u2022 unitization and pooling of properties;\n\u2022 air quality, noise levels and related permits;\n\u2022 rights-of-way and easements;\n\u2022 reports concerning operations to regulatory authorities;\n\u2022 calculation and payment of royalties;\n\u2022 gathering, transportation and marketing of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022 taxation; and\n\u2022 waste disposal.\nUnder these laws and regulations, we could be liable for:\n\u2022 personal injuries;\n\u2022 property damage;\n\u2022 oil spills;\n\u2022 discharge or disposal of hazardous materials;\n\u2022 well reclamation costs;\n\u2022 surface remediation and clean-up costs;\n\u2022 fines and penalties;\n\u2022 natural resource damages; and\n\u2022 other environmental protection and damages issues.\nSee \"Business-Regulations and Environmental Matters\" for a more detailed discussion of laws and regulations affecting our operations.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing as well as governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells and adversely affect our production.\nSome of our completion activities and our operations in Pennsylvania involve the use of hydraulic fracturing, which is an important and common process that creates a fracture extending from the well bore in a rock formation to enable oil or natural gas to move more easily through the rock pores to a production well. Fractures are typically created through the injection of water, sand or alternative proppant and chemicals under pressure into target geological formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We regularly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations in Pennsylvania. In California, our completion activities do not involve hydraulic fracturing, but do involve other technologies. Presently, hydraulic fracturing is regulated primarily at the state level, typically by state oil and natural gas commissions and similar agencies, however, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal, state and local government level where we operate have been made to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing and other technologies used to increase production. For example, the City of Los Angeles is currently considering whether to amend its zoning code to restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing and other completion activities. This and similar proposals, if adopted, would likely increase our costs and make it more difficult, or impossible, to pursue some of our development projects.\nIn addition, with increased public concern regarding the potential for hydraulic fracturing to adversely affect drinking water supplies, proposals have been made to enact federal, state and local legislation and regulations that would increase the regulatory burden imposed on hydraulic fracturing. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, or SDWA, over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels. The Safe Drinking Water Act regulates the underground injection of substances through the Underground Injection Control (\"UIC\") program and exempts hydraulic fracturing from the definition of \"underground injection\". However, Congress has from time to time considered legislation that would amend the SDWA to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of \"underground injection\" and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process. The U.S. Congress may consider similar SDWA legislation in the future.\nIn February 2014, the EPA asserted federal regulatory authority under the SDWA's UIC program over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives, and requested comments in May 2014 on a proposal to require disclosure of chemical ingredients in hydraulic fracturing fluids under the Toxic Substances Control Act. Because the EPA's Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking did not propose any actual regulation, it is unclear how any federal disclosure requirements that add to any applicable state disclosure requirements already in effect may affect our operations. Further, on October 21, 2011, the EPA announced its intention to propose federal Clean Water Act regulations governing wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and certain other natural gas operations, but has not yet proposed any such regulations. In addition, the U.S. Department of the Interior published a Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on May 16, 2013 that would update existing regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities on federal and Indian lands, including requirements for chemical disclosure, well bore integrity and handling of flowback water. This proposed rulemaking is currently pending. Studies by the EPA and other federal agencies are underway that focus on the environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing activities, with draft reports expected for public comment and peer review in 2015. These studies could spur further regulation. Additional regulations adopted at the federal or state level could result in permitting delays and cost increases.\nAlong with several other states, Pennsylvania has adopted laws and proposed regulations that require oil and natural gas operators to disclose chemical ingredients and water volumes used to hydraulically fracture wells, in addition to more stringent well construction and monitoring requirements. The chemical ingredient information is generally available to the public via online databases, and this may bring more public scrutiny to hydraulic fracturing operations. In addition, local governments may also adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing, in particular. In Pennsylvania, although the legislature passed legislation to make regulation of drilling uniform throughout the state, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in Robinson Township v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania struck down portions of that legislation. Following this decision, local governments in Pennsylvania may adopt ordinances regulating drilling and hydraulic fracturing activities, especially within residential areas. If new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nOur derivatives activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our income.\nIn order to achieve a more predictable cash flow, reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas, and comply with credit agreement requirements, we currently, and may in the future, enter into financial derivatives contracts affecting a portion of our oil and natural gas production. Financial derivatives contracts expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\n\u2022 production is less than expected;\n\u2022 the counterparty to the derivatives contract defaults on its contractual obligations; or\n\u2022 there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and the actual price received.\nIn addition, these types of derivatives arrangements limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas for the production affected by the financial derivatives contracts and may expose us to cash margin requirements or increased demands for collateral from our counterparties to such contracts.\nFinancial uncertainties in the broader economy as a whole may increase the risk that a counterparty may default on its obligations, as was demonstrated by the recent sub-prime mortgage losses incurred by many banks and other financial institutions (and which prompted the U.S. Congress to attempt to mitigate such risks in the future through the Dodd-Frank Act). Such losses, if they occur, may affect the ability of the counterparties to meet their obligations to us on derivatives transactions, which would reduce our revenues from derivatives at a time when we are also receiving a lower price for our oil and natural gas sales. As a result, our financial condition could be materially or adversely affected.\nWe have elected not to designate our commodity derivatives as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. Accordingly, such contracts are recorded at fair value on our Balance Sheet and changes in fair value are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as they occur.\nThe enactment of derivatives legislation, and the promulgation of regulations pursuant thereto, could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to hedge risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\") requires, among other things, that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\"CFTC\") enact regulations affecting financial derivatives contracts and the parties who enter into them (\"Swap Dealers\" and \"Major Swap Participants\"). The nature and scope of the regulations, which may result in additional capital or margin requirements or other limitations relating to our use of financial derivatives contracts to hedge commodity price risk, could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement and execute our hedging strategy. In particular, a requirement to post cash collateral in connection with our financial derivatives positions, which are currently collateralized on a non-cash basis by our oil and natural gas properties and other assets, would likely make it impracticable to implement our current hedging strategy or to meet the hedging requirements contained in our Third Amended and Restated Credit Facility (the \"Credit Facility\"). In addition, requirements and limitations imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act and the CFTC on our derivative counterparties could increase the costs of pursuing our hedging strategy. Finally, since the legislation was intended, in part, to decrease the volatility of commodity prices by restricting speculative trading in financial derivatives contracts our revenues could be negatively affected if the Dodd-Frank Act and CFTC regulations result in lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition and our results of operations.\nUnder current CFTC regulations, a party whose core business is the exploration, production and sale of oil, natural gas or other energy commodities, and who is trading in financial derivatives solely for the purpose of hedging commercial risks associated with its core business, and who is not trading in financial derivatives solely for the purpose of earning a profit in the trading of such derivatives as a business in-and-of-itself, is not a \"Swap Dealer\" or \"Major Swap Participant\" within the meaning of the Dodd-Frank Act (unless it has positions the notional value of which are in excess of $8 billion, which would bring in only the largest of companies). Hedging by use of financial derivatives in this manner and subject to these restrictions puts such activity outside the reach of the CFTC and the Dodd-Frank Act. Moreover, physical forward transactions (transactions calling for physical delivery of a commodity in the future, which are not financial derivatives contracts) are specifically exempt from the reach of the CFTC and the Dodd-Frank Act. We do not believe that we meet the definition of \"Swap Dealer\" or \"Major Swap Participant\" and that the financial derivatives contracts that we enter into do not fall within the reach of the CFTC or the Dodd-Frank Act, but we cannot predict action by the CFTC with respect to any of these definitions or its future regulations, how these regulations will be interpreted or applied by the CFTC, or the effect that any of these regulations, as modified or applied in the future, will have on our hedging activities, or our ability to hedge at all.\nOur hedging activities could result in the imposition of additional administrative burdens on us and expenses to us. Although we do not expect to be deemed to be, or to be regulated as, as \"Swap\nDealer\" or \"Major Swap Participant,\" our counterparties in financial derivatives contracts may be regulated as \"Swap Dealers\" or \"Major Swap Participants\" and, in order to comply with regulations applicable to them, these counterparties may require that we supply certain information to them from time-to-time, and may further require that we obtain a registration number to supply to the CFTC. Also, depending on the number and nature of our financial derivatives contracts that we may have open at any given time, the CFTC may require that we file with the CFTC certain reports. Compliance with these requests and requirements could result in increased administrative burdens upon and increased expenses to us.\nProposed changes to U.S. and state tax laws, if adopted, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPresident Obama has made proposals that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to United States tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. Legislation has been introduced in Congress that would implement many of President Obama's proposals. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain U.S. production activities for oil and gas production, and (iv) the increase in the amortization period from two years to seven years for geophysical costs paid or incurred in connection with the exploration for, or development of, oil or natural gas within the United States. It is unclear, however, whether any such changes will be enacted or how soon such changes could be effective. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could defer or eliminate certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development, and any such change could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe could also be adversely affected by future changes to applicable state tax laws and regulations. For example, proposals have been made to amend California State and local laws to impose \"windfall profits,\" severance or other taxes on oil and natural gas companies. If any of these proposals become law, our costs would increase, possibly materially. Significant financial difficulties currently facing the State of California and other localities may increase the likelihood that one or more of these proposals will become law. For example, in California, there have been proposals at the legislative and executive levels over the past several years for tax increases which have included a severance tax as high as 12.5% on all oil production in California. Although the proposals have not passed the California Legislature, the financial crisis in the State of California could lead to a severance tax on oil being imposed in the future.\nIn February 2012, the state legislature of Pennsylvania passed a new natural gas impact fee. The legislation imposes an annual fee on natural gas and oil operators for each well drilled for a period of fifteen years. The fee is on a sliding scale set by the Public Utility Commission and is based on two factors: changes in the Consumer Price Index and the average NYMEX natural gas prices from the last day of each month. There can be no assurance that the impact fee will remain as currently structured or that new or additional taxes will not be imposed. In addition, there is currently no severance tax imposed on natural gas or oil in Pennsylvania. However on February 11, 2015, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf proposed the Pennsylvania Education Reinvestment Act, a new severance tax targeting proceeds from production of unconventional natural gas wells within the state of Pennsylvania. The proposal includes a 5% tax on the value of the gas at the wellhead plus a 4.7cents per thousand cubic feet of volume severed. Additionally, no portion of the tax imposed in this legislation would be allowed to be deducted from royalty payments. The Governor's office has stated that this proposal would replace the existing impact fee. There is no assurance as to the final form of the proposal, or whether the proposal will be adopted. Changes to the current impact fee, or the imposition of a new severance\ntax, could negatively affect our future cash flows and financial condition; however, no assurance can be made until the severance tax is made final.\nOur operations are subject to environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nOur oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are subject to stringent and comprehensive federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing occupational health and safety aspects of our operations, the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations applicable to our operations, including the acquisition of a permit before conducting drilling or other regulated activities; restriction of types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment; limitation or prohibition of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; and imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the EPA, and analogous state agencies have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, oftentimes requiring difficult and costly compliance or corrective actions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations.\nThere is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of our operations, as a result of our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, because of air emissions and wastewater discharges related to our operations and due to historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Under certain environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to joint and several, strict liability for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination or if the operations were not in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. Private parties, including the owners of properties upon which our wells are drilled and facilities where our petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property or natural resource damages. In addition, the risk of accidental spills or releases could expose us to significant liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Environmental advocacy groups and others continue to raise questions and concerns about potential environmental issues that may be associated with hydraulic fracturing, horizontal drilling, and related operations that are key aspects of our business, including concerns about potential impacts on groundwater quality, seismic activity, and greenhouse gas emissions; any of these could lead to changes in regulations in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly well drilling, construction, completion or water management activities, or waste control, handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our own results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance.\nThe geographic concentration of our oil reserves in California exposes us to more risks and may have a greater effect on our ability to sell our oil production than if our reserves were more geographically diversified.\nA substantial portion of our revenues are generated from oil sales and all of our oil reserves are located in California. Any regional events, including price fluctuations, natural disasters and restrictive\nregulations that increase costs, reduce availability of equipment or supplies, reduce demand or limit our production may impact our operations more than if our reserves were more geographically diversified.\nOur California oil production is, on average, heavier than premium grade light oil and the margin (sales price minus production costs) is generally less than that of lighter oil sales due to the processes required to refine this type of oil and the transportation requirements. As such, the effect of material price decreases will more adversely affect the profitability of heavy oil production compared with lighter grades of oil.\nWe are subject to the full cost ceiling limitation which may result in a write-down of our estimated net reserves in the future.\nWe utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our oil and natural gas properties. Under the full cost method, we are subject to quarterly calculations of a \"ceiling\" or limitation on the amount of our oil and natural gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet. If the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties exceed the cost center ceiling, we are subject to a write-down of our net oil and natural gas properties to the extent of such excess. A capitalized cost ceiling test impairment also reduces earnings and impacts stockholders' equity in the period of occurrence and results in lower amortization expense in future periods. The discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments. The risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices are depressed or volatile.\nFor 2014, 2013 and 2012, there was no ceiling test impairment on our oil and natural gas properties; however, a write-down of proved oil and natural gas properties may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments in our estimated proved reserves. An expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher oil and natural gas prices may have increased the applicable ceiling in the subsequent period. This and other factors could cause us to write down our oil and natural gas properties or other assets in the future and incur a non-cash charge against future earnings.\nCertain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we own leasehold interests in approximately 73,355 shallow undeveloped net acres in the Washakie Basin of Wyoming that we believe may be prospective for CBM development and approximately 59,070 deep undeveloped net acres in areas we believe may be prospective for the Niobrara Shale and other deep formations. A large portion of our acreage in the Washakie Basin is not currently held by production. Unless production in paying quantities is established on units containing these leases, approximately zero net acres, 485 net acres and 506 net acres of these shallow leases will expire in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. If our leases expire, we will lose our right to develop the related properties, and could lose up to a total of 45,595 net acres of shallow rights and 39,229 total net acres of deep rights in 2017.\nOur drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, and regulatory approvals. Further, some of our acreage is located in areas where we do not hold the majority of the acreage and therefore it is likely that we will not be named the operator of these areas. As a non-operating leaseholder we have less control over the timing of drilling, and there is additional risk of expirations occurring in sections where we are not\nthe operator. Any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPart of our strategy involves using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques, which involve risks and uncertainties in their application.\nOur operations in Pennsylvania involve utilizing some of the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by us, other oil and gas exploration and production companies and our service providers. Risks that we face while drilling, including or as a result of the application of these techniques, include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 effectively controlling the level of pressure flowing from particular wells;\n\u2022 landing our wellbore in the desired drilling zone;\n\u2022 staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation;\n\u2022 running our casing the entire length of the wellbore; and\n\u2022 being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal wellbore.\nRisks that we face while completing our wells, including or as a result of the application of these techniques, include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 the ability to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages;\n\u2022 the ability to run tools the entire length of the wellbore during completion operations; and\n\u2022 the ability to successfully clean out the wellbore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur future success depends largely on the success of our exploration, exploitation, development and production activities. These activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that we will not find any commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs. Our decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit prospects or properties depends in part on the evaluation of geophysical and geological analyses, production data, and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. Our costs of drilling, completing, producing and operating wells are often uncertain before drilling commences. Drilling for oil and natural gas can be unprofitable, not only from dry holes, but from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to pay the costs or return a profit. In addition, our drilling and producing operations, may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of other factors, including:\n\u2022 delays in obtaining drilling permits from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022 unusual or unexpected geological formations;\n\u2022 unexpected drilling conditions, including ground shifting or quakes;\n\u2022 pressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u2022 equipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022 well blow-outs;\n\u2022 fires and explosions;\n\u2022 pipeline and processing interruptions or unavailability;\n\u2022 title problems;\n\u2022 objections from surface owners in the areas where we operate;\n\u2022 adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022 lack of market demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022 damage to natural resources due to underground migration of hydraulic fracturing fluids;\n\u2022 pollution and other environmental damage, including spills or mishandling of recovered hydraulic fracturing fluids;\n\u2022 delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with environmental and other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 shortages of or delays in the availability or delivery of drilling rigs and equipment; and\n\u2022 reductions in oil and natural gas prices.\nOur future drilling activities may not be successful. Our drilling success rate could decline generally or within a particular area and we could incur losses by drilling unproductive wells. Also, we may not be able to obtain sufficient contracts covering our lease rights in potential drilling locations. We cannot be sure that we will ever drill our identified potential drilling locations, or that we will produce natural gas or oil from them or from any other potential drilling locations. Shut-in wells, curtailed production and other production interruptions may negatively impact our business and result in decreased revenues.\nAll of our oil production in California is dedicated to one customer and as a result, our credit exposure to this customer is significant.\nWe have entered into an oil marketing arrangement with Phillips 66 Company (formerly ConocoPhillips) under which Phillips 66 Company purchases all of our net oil production in California. We generally do not require letters of credit or other collateral to support these trade receivables. Accordingly, a material adverse change in their financial condition or their unwillingness to enter into future purchase arrangements could adversely impact our ability to sell our California oil, and thereby adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur development and exploration operations require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. We spend and will continue to need a substantial amount of capital for the acquisition, exploration, exploitation, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. We have historically addressed our short and long-term liquidity needs through the use of cash flow provided by operating activities, borrowing under bank credit facilities, and the issuance of equity and debt securities. Without adequate financing we may not be able to successfully execute our operating strategy. The availability of these sources of capital will depend upon a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022 general economic, financial and market conditions;\n\u2022 oil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022 our market value and operating performance;\n\u2022 timely issuance of permits and licenses by governmental agencies;\n\u2022 the success of our CBM projects in the Washakie Basin;\n\u2022 the success of our waterflood recovery oil projects in the WTU and the NWU;\n\u2022 the success of our Marcellus Assets that we recently acquired;\n\u2022 our success in locating and producing new reserves;\n\u2022 amounts of necessary working capital and expenses; and\n\u2022 the level of production from existing and new wells.\nWe may not be able to execute our operating strategy if we cannot obtain adequate capital. If low oil and natural gas prices, lack of adequate gathering or transportation facilities, operating difficulties or other factors, many of which are beyond our control, cause our revenues and cash flows from operating activities to decrease, our borrowing base under our Credit Facility may be limited or reduced, and our ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations may also be limited.\nAdditional financing sources may be required in the future to fund our developmental and exploratory drilling. Financing may not be available in the future under existing or new financing arrangements, or we may not be able to obtain the necessary financing on acceptable terms, if at all. If sufficient capital resources are not available, we may be forced to curtail drilling, acquisition and other operations, or sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis. We would also face a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProducing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future success depends on our ability to find, develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Our proved reserves generally decline when production occurs, unless we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both. We may not be able to find, develop or acquire additional reserves on an economic basis. Furthermore, if oil and natural gas prices increase, our costs for additional reserves could also increase. Thus, our future oil and natural gas reserves and production, cash flow and income are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to find, finance, acquire or develop additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs.\nOur identified drilling location inventories are scheduled out over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.\nOur management has identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. These identified drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including the availability of capital, seasonal and weather conditions, regulatory approvals, oil and natural gas prices, costs and expenses, and drilling and production results. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled, or if we will be able to produce natural gas or oil from these or any other potential drilling locations. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face significantly increasing water injection and disposal regulations and costs in our drilling operations.\nWater is an essential component of oil and natural gas production during the drilling, and in particular, hydraulic fracturing, process. Our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of or recycle water used in our exploration and production operations, could adversely impact our operations.\nMoreover, the imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of natural gas. The Clean Water Act and similar state laws impose restrictions and strict controls on the discharge of produced waters and other natural gas and oil waste where such discharges could affect surface or ground waters. For example, state and federal regulations prohibit the discharge of produced water and sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the natural gas and oil industry into coastal waters. We must obtain permits for certain discharges into waters and wetlands and for construction activities that may affect regulated water resources. The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain natural gas and oil exploration and production facilities to obtain permits for storm water discharges. The Clean Water Act and similar state laws provide for civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharges of pollutants, reportable quantities of oil and other hazardous substances. Moreover, sending wastewater to publicly-owned treatment works in Pennsylvania requires certain levels of pretreatment that may effectively prohibit such disposal, and our continued ability to use injection wells as a disposal option not only will depend on federal or state regulations, but also on whether available injection wells have sufficient storage capacities. Compliance with current and future federal, state and local environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be accurately predicted.\nWe face increasing natural gas disposal regulations and costs in our Wilmington oil operations that could limit our oil production.\nThe State of California and the EPA have restrictive regulations for the disposition of natural gas produced from our Wilmington oil drilling operations. Natural gas production has continued to grow along with increasing oil production, particularly in the WTU. Because the gas volume from the WTU was historically too low to justify gas sales equipment, the gas has been flared for many years under a permit from the South Coast Air Quality Management District (\"SCAQMD\"). In late 2007, Warren entered into an agreement with the SCAQMD which allowed Warren to commission six microturbines to generate electrical power from the otherwise flared gas and resume full production. As oil production grew since that time, the excess gas produced but not consumed by our microturbines began to exceed our gas flare limitation. In March 2008, we presented our plan to the SCAQMD to seek approvals from regulatory authorities to dispose of our WTU produced gas by re-injection in underground formations or by selling it directly to a third party user. Warren also applied to the SCAQMD for a permit to construct a new high efficiency clean enclosed burner to replace the existing gas flare. Our filed applications for permits requested the authority to install and operate certain pieces of new best available control technology equipment. On July 19, 2011 the SCAQMD certified the Company's CEQA documents and issued all of the related permits, including gas handling equipment. These equipment upgrades will help increase the Company's oil processing capability to a ceiling of 5,000 barrels of oil per day at the Wilmington Townlot Unit. As requested by the SCAQMD, in 2012 the Company began preparing an additional analysis under CEQA to analyze and mitigate the potential air and other emissions that may be associated with pipeline connections and the installation of gas transportation, compression and related equipment that will be required to sell excess gas through a\nlocal gas utility company to third parties. This additional CEQA analysis was completed in late 2014, and construction permits were issued by the SCAQMD. Warren is currently constructing and installing the gas transportation, compression and related equipment, and will schedule governmental inspections of the system and its operating capabilities in late 2015. Any delays in obtaining equipment or constructing the system; any delays by regulatory agencies or public utilities in approving or inspecting the operation of the system or issuing permits in the future to operate the system or dispose of the natural gas, or our inability to locate a third party to purchase the excess gas could limit our future oil production levels until such matters are resolved.\nMarket conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production.\nMarket conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas processing or transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production. The marketability of our production depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities. This dependence is heightened in our CBM operations where this infrastructure is less developed than in our oil operations. For example, there is limited pipeline capacity in the southern portion of the Washakie Basin. Also, as production volumes grow in the Atlantic Rim area, additional pipeline capacity and gas compression will be required.\nWe deliver oil and natural gas through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own. These facilities may not be available to us in the future. Our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas is affected and may be harmed by:\n\u2022 the lack of pipeline transmission facilities or carrying capacity;\n\u2022 federal and state regulation of oil and natural gas production; and\n\u2022 federal and state transportation, taxation and energy policies.\nWe own 100% of the compression facilities and pipeline in the Atlantic Rim area of the Washakie Basin in Wyoming. Any significant change in pipeline or compression operations or other market factors affecting our overall infrastructure facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver the natural gas we produce to market in an efficient manner, or to obtain adequate natural gas prices. In some cases, we may be required to shut-in wells, at least temporarily, because of a lack of a market or the inadequacy or unavailability of transportation facilities. If that were to occur, we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until arrangements could be made to deliver our production to market.\nInsufficient takeaway capacity in the Marcellus Shale could cause significant fluctuations in our realized natural gas prices.\nThe Marcellus Shale natural gas business environment has historically been characterized by periods in which production has surpassed local takeaway capacity, sometimes resulting in curtailment of production or substantial discounts in the price received by producers. We expect that a significant portion of our production in the Marcellus Shale will be transported on pipelines that experience a negative differential to NYMEX Henry Hub prices. Should production growth in the Marcellus Shale continue to outpace the increases in takeaway capacity or if we are unable to secure firm takeaway capacity to accommodate our growing production, it could result in substantial discounts in the price we receive for our production, may limit our ability to market our production and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be affected by climate change and market or regulatory responses to climate change.\nClimate change, including the impact of global warming, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gasses, including exhaust from generators, engines and flaring of excess natural gas, could significantly increase our operating costs. Restrictions on emissions could also affect businesses that (a) use oil and natural gas to produce energy, or (b) manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels, including chemical producers, farmers and food producers, and automakers and other manufacturers. Significant cost increases, government regulation, or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the oil and natural gas commodities, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain of our oil and natural gas commodity purchasers and the markets for certain of the commodities in an unpredictable manner, including, for example, the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers and tax credits for wind turbine and solar power generation. We could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change. Finally, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, or GHGs in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. Any of these factors, individually or in conjunction with one or more of the other factors, or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could reduce the demand for oil and natural gas commodities and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. For a more detailed discussion, please see \"Business-Regulations and Environmental Matters-Climate Change Legislation and Greenhouse Gas Regulations.\"\nAcquired properties or businesses may not produce as projected, and we may be unable to determine reserve potential, identify liabilities associated with the properties or businesses or obtain protection from sellers against them, which could cause us to incur losses.\nOne of our growth strategies is to pursue selective acquisitions of oil and natural gas reserves. We perform a review of the target properties that we believe is consistent with industry practices. However, these reviews may not be completely accurate. Generally, it is not feasible to review in depth every individual property involved in each acquisition. Even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable, even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, a seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of those problems, and we often assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with the properties we acquire.\nIn addition, any acquisition involves, among other things, the following potential risks:\n\u2022 the risk that reserves expected to support the acquired assets may not be of the anticipated magnitude or may not be developed as anticipated;\n\u2022 the risk of title defects discovered after closing;\n\u2022 inaccurate assumptions about revenues and costs, including synergies;\n\u2022 significant increases in our indebtedness and working capital requirements;\n\u2022 an inability to transition and integrate successfully or timely the businesses we acquire;\n\u2022 the cost of transition and integration of data systems and processes;\n\u2022 the potential environmental problems and costs;\n\u2022 the assumption of unknown liabilities;\n\u2022 limitations on rights to indemnity from the seller;\n\u2022 the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022 increased demands on existing personnel and on our corporate structure;\n\u2022 disputes arising out of acquisitions;\n\u2022 customer or key employee losses of the acquired businesses; and\n\u2022 the failure to realize expected growth or profitability.\nThe scope and cost of these risks may ultimately be materially greater than estimated at the time of the acquisition. Further, our future acquisition costs may be higher than those we have achieved historically. Any of these factors could adversely impact our future growth and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSeasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.\nOil and natural gas operations in Wyoming can be adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations designed to protect various wildlife, the environment and related matters. Our operations in Wyoming are conducted in areas subject to extreme weather conditions and in difficult terrain. Primarily in the winter and spring, our operations are often curtailed because of cold, snow and wet conditions, as well as lease stipulations. In certain areas on federal lands, drilling and other oil and natural gas activities can only be conducted during limited times of the year. This limits our ability to operate in those areas and can intensify competition during those times for drilling rigs, oil field equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend to a large extent on the efforts and continued employment of our executive management team and other key personnel. The loss of the services of our key personnel could adversely affect our business, and we do not maintain key man insurance on the lives of these persons.\nOur drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists, engineers, landmen and other professionals. Competition for many of these professionals is intense. If we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel and professionals, our ability to compete could be significantly impaired.\nA payment default or an acceleration under our Credit Facility could result in an event of default and acceleration of indebtedness under the Senior Notes.\nIf the indebtedness under the Senior Notes were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that we would have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to repay such indebtedness in full. In addition, our obligations under our Credit Facility are collateralized by perfected first-priority liens and security interests on substantially all of the oil and gas assets of the Company and the Guarantors (as defined\nherein), and is guaranteed by the Guarantors, which are three wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company, and if we are unable to repay our indebtedness under the Credit Facility, the lenders could seek to foreclose on our assets.\nWe do not insure against all potential operating risks. We may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of various lawsuits, which may not be fully covered by our insurance.\nOur insurance coverage does not cover all potential risks, losses, costs, or liabilities. We ordinarily maintain insurance against various losses and liabilities arising from our operations in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that management believes to be prudent. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events or in excess of existing insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. Our operations could be subject to earthquakes, mudslides, fires, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, extreme weather conditions and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions, for which we are predominantly self-insured for these types of occurrences. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. A substantial portion of our oil properties and operations are located in southern California near major earthquake faults. Our revenues and income could be adversely affected if our operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters or environmental, public health, or political issues. The ultimate impact of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown, but our revenue, profitability and financial condition could suffer in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster.\nOur oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to numerous hazards and risks associated with drilling for, operating, producing and transporting oil and natural gas, and any of these risks can cause substantial losses resulting from:\n\u2022 environmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of natural gas, oil, brine water, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution being released into the environment;\n\u2022 abnormally pressured formations and ground subsidence;\n\u2022 mechanical difficulties, inadequate oil field drilling and service tools, and casing collapses;\n\u2022 fires and explosions;\n\u2022 personal injuries and death;\n\u2022 labor and employment issues;\n\u2022 regulatory investigations and penalties; and\n\u2022 natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods.\nAny of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us. Many of these risks are not insured because the cost of available insurance, if any, is excessive. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. If a significant accident or other event occurs that is not fully covered by insurance, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See \"Business-Operating Hazards and Insurance.\"\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, and many of our competitors have greater financial, technological and other resources than we do, which may adversely affect our ability to compete.\nWe operate in highly competitive areas of oil and natural gas exploration, exploitation, development and acquisition with a substantial number of other companies. We face intense competition from independent, technology-driven companies, as well as from both major and other independent oil and natural gas companies, in each of the following areas:\n\u2022 acquiring desirable producing properties or new leases for future exploration;\n\u2022 marketing our oil and natural gas production;\n\u2022 integrating new technologies; and\n\u2022 acquiring the equipment, personnel and expertise necessary to develop and operate our properties.\nMany of our competitors have financial, managerial, technological and other resources substantially greater than ours. These companies may be able to pay more for exploratory prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties, and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. To the extent our competitors are able to pay more for properties than we are, we will be at a competitive disadvantage. Further, many of our competitors may enjoy technological advantages and may be able to implement new technologies more rapidly than we can. Our ability to explore for oil and natural gas and to acquire additional properties in the future will depend upon our ability to successfully conduct operations, implement advanced technologies, evaluate and select suitable properties, and consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment.\nDefects in the title to any of our oil and natural gas interests could result in the loss of some of our oil and natural gas properties or portions thereof, or liability for losses resulting from defects in the assignment of leasehold rights.\nWe obtain interests in oil and natural gas properties with varying degrees of warranty of title, such as general, special or quitclaim or without any warranty. We acquired our interests in the WTU in 1999 and 2005 with no title opinion as to the interests we acquired, which may ultimately prove to be less than the interests we believe we own. The prior owner had acquired its interests from a third party that, in turn, had acquired its interest from Exxon Corporation with no warranty of title. Exxon had owned the WTU for over 25 years before its sale in 1997. Similarly, when we acquired our interest in the NWU in December 2005, we had no title opinion prepared as to the interests acquired. The prior owner had owned the NWU for over 15 years, acquired the NWU from Sun Oil Corporation, which had owned the NWU for over 20 years before its sale in 1990 without warranty of title. Losses of title to the WTU or the NWU may result from title defects or from ownership of a lesser interest than we believe we acquired. In other instances, title opinions may not be obtained if in our discretion it would be uneconomical or impractical to do so. Furthermore, in certain instances we may determine to purchase properties even though certain technical title defects exist if we believe it to be an acceptable risk under the circumstances. These situations increase the possible risk of loss and could potentially result in total loss of title to some or all of the properties we purchased.\nProspects that we decide to drill may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities.\nA prospect is a property on which we have identified what our geoscientists believe, based on available seismic and geological information, to be indications of oil or natural gas. Our prospects are in various stages of evaluation, and range from a prospect that is ready to drill to a prospect that will require substantial additional geological or seismic data processing and interpretation. However, the use of seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not\nenable us to know conclusively, prior to drilling and testing, whether natural gas or oil will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or be economically viable. If we drill wells in our current and future prospects that are identified as non-economic wells or dry holes, our drilling success rate may decline and materially harm our business. In sum, the cost of drilling, completing and operating any wells is often uncertain and new wells may not be productive.\nAs co-venturer in joint ventures, we are liable for various obligations of those joint ventures.\nWe have entered into joint ventures in the past and may do so again in the future. As a co-venturer, we are contingently liable for the obligations of the joint venture, including responsibility for day-to-day operations and liabilities which cannot be repaid from joint venture assets, insurance proceeds or indemnification by others. In the future, we might be exposed to litigation in connection with joint venture activities, or find it necessary to advance funds on behalf of joint ventures to protect the value of the oil and natural gas properties by drilling wells to produce undeveloped reserves or to pay lease operating expenses in excess of production. These activities may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations\nOur role as co-venturer in joint ventures may result in conflicts of interest, which may not be resolved in our best interests or the best interests of our noteholders.\nWe have entered into joint ventures in the past and may do so again in the future. Our role as co-venturer in joint ventures may result in conflicts of interest between the interests of those entities and our noteholders. Any resolution of these conflicts may not always be in our best interests and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have limited control over activities on properties we do not operate, which could reduce our production and revenues.\nA portion of our business activities is conducted through joint operating or other agreements under which we own partial ownership or working interests in oil and natural gas properties. We may not operate all of the properties in which we have an interest and may not have the ability to remove the operator in the event of poor performance. As a result, in such situations, we may be limited in our ability to influence normal operating procedures, expenditures or future development of underlying properties and their associated costs. The failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations, or an operator's breach of the applicable agreements, could reduce our revenues and production. Therefore, the success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others depends upon a number of factors outside of our control, including:\n\u2022 timing and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u2022 expertise and financial resources;\n\u2022 inclusion of other participants in drilling wells; and\n\u2022 use of technology.\nShortages of rigs, equipment, supplies and personnel could delay or otherwise adversely affect our cost of operations or our ability to operate according to our business plans.\nIf domestic drilling activity increases, particularly in the fields in which we operate a general shortage of drilling and completion rigs, field equipment and qualified personnel could develop. As a result, the costs and delivery times for rigs, equipment and personnel could be substantially greater than in previous years. From time to time, these costs have sharply increased and could do so again. The demand for and wage rates of qualified drilling rig crews generally rises in response to the\nincreasing number of active rigs in service and could increase sharply in the event of a shortage. Although we own a drilling rig for use in the WTU, shortages of drilling and completion rigs, field equipment or qualified personnel could delay, restrict or curtail our exploration and development operations, which could in turn harm our operating results.\nFailure of our internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results.\nThe management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the Company's transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of the financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely, or to detect and prevent fraud.\nWe make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements, and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn connection with the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors. Our most critical accounting estimates are described in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in this report. In addition, as discussed in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we make certain estimates, including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies. While we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, they are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nComputer security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data in our computer data centers and networks. This data includes intellectual property, our proprietary business information, lists of customers, suppliers and business partners, information concerning our oil and natural gas lessors and minerals, royalty and working interest owners, as well as our employees. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, a disruption of our operations, and damage to our reputation; all of which could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe number of shares eligible for future sale or which have registration rights could adversely affect the future market for our common stock.\nSales of substantial amounts of previously restricted shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline, or could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional common or preferred stock.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had 80,754,225 shares of common stock issued, 43,423 shares of common stock were issuable upon conversion of our convertible debt and convertible preferred stock, 1,987,159 shares of common stock were issuable upon exercise of outstanding options, and 689,370 shares of restricted stock are issuable upon vesting. Pursuant to a registration rights agreement to which we are party with Citrus, Citrus may require us to file one or more prospectus supplements to the registration statement on Form S-3 we have filed with the SEC for the resale of shares, and any shares sold pursuant to such prospectus supplements would become eligible for sale without restriction by persons other than our affiliates. Additionally, our directors and executive officers, beneficially hold approximately 8% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If our stockholders sell significant amounts of common stock in any public market that develops or exercise their registration rights and sell a large number of shares, the price of our common stock could be negatively affected. If we were to include shares held by those holders in a registration statement pursuant to the exercise of their registration rights, those sales could impair our ability to raise needed capital by depressing the price at which we could sell our common stock or impede such an offering altogether.\nOur stock price has been and may be volatile, and your investment in our stock could decline in value.\nIn recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. Our common stock has experienced and may continue to experience volatility that is not related to our operating performance for reasons that include:\n\u2022 domestic and worldwide supplies and prices of and demand for natural gas and oil;\n\u2022 political conditions in natural gas and oil producing regions;\n\u2022 the success of our operating strategy;\n\u2022 war and acts of terrorism;\n\u2022 demand for our common stock;\n\u2022 revenue and operating results failing to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in any particular quarter or period;\n\u2022 changes in expectations of our future financial performance, or changes in financial estimates, if any, of public market analysts;\n\u2022 investor perception of our industry or our prospects;\n\u2022 general economic trends;\n\u2022 limited trading volume of our stock;\n\u2022 changes in and compliance with environmental and other governmental rules and regulations;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated quarterly variations in our operating results;\n\u2022 our involvement in litigation;\n\u2022 conditions generally affecting the oil and natural gas industry;\n\u2022 the prices of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022 announcements relating to our business or the business of our competitors;\n\u2022 our liquidity; and\n\u2022 our ability to obtain or raise additional funds.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control, and we cannot predict their potential effects on the price of our common stock. We cannot assure that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. In addition, the stock markets in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations.\nIn particular, our stock price was very volatile during 2014, trading between $1.20 and $7.02 per share. In the event that the average closing price of our common stock does not equal or exceed $1.00 per share over a period of 30 consecutive trading days, we will be out of compliance with NASDAQ listing requirements and may become subject to delisting procedures. If our common stock is delisted from the NASDAQ Global Market, such delisting could negatively impact the market price of our common stock, reduce the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, and limit our ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future, and might negatively impact our reputation and, as a consequence, our business.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Maryland law may make it more difficult to effect a change in control, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Maryland law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. We may issue shares of preferred stock in the future without stockholder approval and upon such terms as our board of directors may determine. Our issuance of this preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring, a majority of our outstanding stock, and could potentially prevent the payment of a premium to stockholders in an acquisition.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay, defer or prevent a change in control of us or our management. These provisions include:\n\u2022 giving the board the exclusive right to fill all board vacancies;\n\u2022 providing that special meetings of stockholders may only be called by the board pursuant to a resolution adopted by\n\u2022 a majority of the members of the board, either upon a motion or written request by holders of at least 662/3% of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote, or\n\u2022 by our president;\n\u2022 a classified board of directors;\n\u2022 permitting removal of directors only for cause and with a super-majority vote of the stockholders; and\n\u2022 prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors.\nThese provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. As a result, these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, and could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nWe are also subject to provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law that prohibit business combinations with persons owning 10% or more of the voting shares of a corporation's outstanding stock, unless the combination is approved by the board of directors prior to the person owning 10% or more of the stock, for a period of five years after which the business combination would be subject to special stockholder approval requirements. This provision could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company, or may otherwise discourage a potential third party from attempting to obtain control from us, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe have not paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nUnder the terms of our convertible preferred stock, we may not pay dividends on our common stock unless all accrued dividends on our convertible preferred stock have been paid. We anticipate that we will retain all future earnings and other cash resources for the future operation and development of our business. Accordingly, we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account many factors, including our operating results, financial conditions, current and anticipated cash needs, and plans for expansion.", "PERMNO": 90492, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "WRESQ"}
