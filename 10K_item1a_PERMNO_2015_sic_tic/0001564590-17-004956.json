RISK FACTORS.\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before you invest in our securities, you should give careful consideration to the following risk factors, in addition to the other information included in this annual report, including our financial statements and related notes, before deciding whether to invest in our securities. The occurrence of any of the adverse developments described in the following risk factors could materially and adversely harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe expect that we will need substantial additional funding to expand our commercialization efforts for our C. diff and Group B Strep assay and other new assays.\nMolecular diagnostic development, which includes research and development, pre-clinical and human clinical trials, is a time-consuming and expensive process that takes years to complete. We expect that our expenses will increase substantially as we move new assays through human clinical trials, seek regulatory approvals, and pursue development of additional innovations. If we obtain marketing approval for the diagnostic tests that we develop, license, or acquire, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to regulatory compliance requirements, sales and marketing, manufacturing, and distribution. Net loss for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $89.1 million and $57.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $211.1 million. As discussed in Note 3 to the audited financial statements, our recurring operating losses from operations and our need for additional sources of capital to fund our ongoing operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future, and we anticipate these losses will increase as we continue our development and commercialization of our platform, and seek regulatory approval for additional assays. Accordingly, our ability to\ncontinue as a going concern depends on our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our operations, and there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us or that such financing, if available, will be available on favorable terms. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods.\nWe expect that we will need additional funding to manufacture analyzers to be used by potential customers during the sales evaluation phase.\nOur potential customers evaluate the performance of our products through the use of analyzers that we manufacture and provide at no cost. Our ability to grow our customer base depends upon our ability to obtain additional financing to fund the manufacturing of analyzers to deliver to such potential customers.\nOur inability to raise capital on acceptable terms in the future may cause us to delay, diminish, or curtail certain operational activities, including research and development activities, clinical trials, sales and marketing, and other operations, in order to reduce costs and sustain the business, and such inability would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe expect capital outlays and operating expenditures to increase over the next several years as we work to expand our commercial activities, expand our development activities, conduct clinical trials, expand manufacturing operations and expand our infrastructure. We may need to raise additional capital to, among other things:\n\u2022\nfund clinical trials and pre-clinical trials for our assays under development as requested or required by regulatory agencies;\n\u2022\nsustain commercialization of our C. diff, Group B Strep, e. coli, and Staph ID/R assays and assays under development or review by the FDA;\n\u2022\ncontinue the commercial launch and sale of our Staph ID/R assay;\n\u2022\nexpand and automate our manufacturing capabilities and reduce our cost of sales;\n\u2022\nincrease our sales and marketing efforts to drive market adoption and address competitive developments;\n\u2022\nfinance capital expenditures and our general and administrative expenses;\n\u2022\ndevelop new assays;\n\u2022\nmaintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022\nadd operational, financial and management information systems; and\n\u2022\nhire additional research and development, quality control, scientific, and general and administrative personnel.\nOur present and future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe progress and timing of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe level of research and development investment required to maintain and improve our technology position;\n\u2022\nthe cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights, if any;\n\u2022\nour efforts to acquire or license complementary technologies or acquire complementary businesses;\n\u2022\nchanges in product development plans needed to address any difficulties in commercialization or changing market conditions;\n\u2022\ncompeting technological and market developments;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory policies or laws that may affect our operations; and\n\u2022\nchanges in physician acceptance or medical society recommendations that may affect commercial efforts.\nWe may not be able to continue to operate as a going concern.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going concern in its report on our audited financial statements. Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon, among other factors, the release of restricted cash related to our convertible notes upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the terms of the convertible notes, refinance or existing debt arrangements or obtaining alternate financing. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital. If we are unable to secure additional capital, refinance our existing debt or gain access to the cash in the restricted accounts, we may be required to curtail our business plans and initiatives and take additional measures to reduce costs in order to conserve our cash in amounts sufficient to sustain operations and meet our obligations.\nWe have a history of highly dilutive financings and reverse stock splits which amplifies the dilutive effect of these financings on our stockholders. Any investment in our common stock will likely be highly diluted through the future conversion of our outstanding derivative securities and our likely future capital raising efforts.\nIn the past 12 months, the Company has conducted three (3) stock splits to address the Company\u2019s need to issue shares of common stock to raise capital to fund ongoing operations. These stock splits were as follows:\nThe multiple stock splits permitted the Company to issue a large number of shares of common stock pursuant to issued and outstanding convertible securities as well as conduct several public offerings to raise additional capital for operations. The conversion of these derivative securities resulted in the substantial dilution of stockholders over the course of the last 12 months. The following table sets forth the number of post-split shares that were issued upon conversion of these derivative securities, the post-split average conversion price, the number of pre-split shares (being the number of share equivalents prior to the three reverse stock splits, calculated by multiplying post-split shares by the cumulative ratio of 840,000 to 1) and the pre-split equivalent conversion prices.\nThe large number of pre-split equivalent shares of common stock issued is due primarily to three factors: (1) the conversion price of the 2015 Notes being tied to a discount to the market price on the date of the installment payments, (2) the continued decline in the price of the Company\u2019s shares of common stock following each of the reverse splits (3) the conversion of a large number of Series F Preferred Stock at the current post conversion price of $0.002 per $1,000 principal amount of each share of Series F Preferred Stock and (4) the conversion price of the 2016 Notes being tied to a discount to the market price on the date of conversion. Following each reverse split, the issuance of common stock pursuant to these derivative securities and other market factors resulted in a rapid decline in the market price of our common stock. This decline in market price resulted in a greater number of shares of common stock being issued to settle conversion of these derivative securities which was amplified over time by the cumulative effective of the reverse split ratios.\nIn order to maintain flexibility to settle our obligations under our convertible notes issued on July 1, 2016 (the \u201c2016 Notes\u201d), and our Series F Preferred Stock through the issuance of shares and to permit the Company to have available additional shares of common stock to pursue further financing for the Company as needed, our board of directors has unanimously determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders to amend the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation to effect the a reverse stock split at a ratio between 1-for-1,700 and 1-for-2,000 (the \u201c2017 Reverse Stock Split\u201d) and to the effect the Share Increase (the \u201cAuthorized Share Increase\u201d).\nAt a special meeting of stockholders held on March 9, 2017, our stockholders (i) approved a reverse split of our common stock at a ratio between 1-for-1,700 and 1-for-2,000, to be effective upon a date on or prior to May 31, 2017, such ratio and date to be determined by our Board and (ii) approved the increase to our authorized common stock from 1,500,000,000 shares to 3,000,000,000 shares.\nIt is anticipated that the Company will issue a majority of those shares of common stock primarily as follows (i) to settle conversion of the Company\u2019s outstanding Series F Preferred Stock, (ii) to settle conversion of the Company\u2019s outstanding $32.2 million of 2016 Notes outstanding as of March 17, 2017 and (iii) to raise additional capital through one or more offerings of equity or equity-linked securities.\nBoth the Series F Preferred Stock (beginning July 2017) and the 2016 Notes have conversion prices that are tied to a discount to the Company\u2019s recent average trading price. As a result, if after the 2017 Reverse Stock Split is effective and the stock price again declines, the number of post-split shares that must be issued to settle these securities will increase and the pre-split equivalent number of shares will increase rapidly due to the large proposed ratios of 1,700-for-1 and 2,000-for-1. The dilution to current stockholders will be substantial; similar to the effect of past stock splits.\nOur board of directors believes that the 2017 Reverse Stock Split could also facilitate our efforts to raise capital to fund our operations. We will need to raise additional capital and may elect to do so through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities. The 2017 Reverse Stock Split would reduce the number of shares of common stock outstanding without reducing the total number of authorized shares of common stock. As a result, we would have a larger number of authorized but unissued shares from which to issue additional shares of common stock, or securities convertible or exercisable into shares of common stock, in equity or convertible debt financing transactions. As of the date hereof, we have no specific plans, arrangements or understandings, whether written or oral, with respect to the increase in shares available for issuance as a result of the proposed reverse stock split or the increase in authorized shares.\nRaising additional capital will cause dilution to our existing stockholders, and restrict our operations or require us to relinquish certain intellectual property rights.\nWe will seek additional capital through a combination of public and private equity offerings, debt financings, strategic partnerships and alliances, licensing arrangements and grants. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders may be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt and receivables financings may be coupled with an equity component, such as warrants to purchase shares, which could also result in dilution of our existing stockholders\u2019 ownership. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. A failure to obtain adequate funds may cause us to curtail certain operational activities, including research and development, regulatory trials, sales and marketing, and manufacturing operations, in order to reduce costs and sustain the business, and would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nThe issuance of shares of our common stock pursuant to the Series D warrants, 2016 Notes and related Series H warrants and the Series F Preferred Stock will result in significant dilution to our stockholders.\nAt a special meeting of our shareholders held on March 9, 2017, our shareholders approved a reverse split of our common stock at a ratio between 1-for-1,700 and 1-for-2,000, to be effective upon a date on or prior to May 31, 2017, such ratio and date to be determined by our Board. This reverse split of our common stock will mean that our stockholders will experience significant dilution as a result of shares of common stock issued pursuant to our outstanding 2016 Notes, Series F Preferred Stock, Series D Warrants and Series H warrants. Under the Series D warrants, 2016 Notes and related Series H warrants and Series F Preferred Stock, we are required to have reserved or have designated for future issuance a number of shares of common stock necessary to effect the conversion of such convertible notes and preferred stock and the exercise of the Series D warrants and Series H warrants, subject to potential future anti-dilution adjustments.\nThe price at which the Company will convert the 2016 Notes installment amounts is equal to the lowest of (x) $0.50 per share, subject to adjustment as provided therein, (y) 85% of the lower of (I) the lowest volume weighted average price of the common stock and (II) the lowest closing bid price of the common stock, in each case, during the five (5) consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day on which the holder delivers a conversion notice to the Company (such trading prices to be appropriately adjusted for any share dividend, share split, share combination, reclassification or similar transaction during such five (5) consecutive trading day period), and (z) 85% of the volume weighted average price of the common stock during the period beginning at 9:30:01 a.m., New York time (or such other time as the principal market publicly announces the official opening of trading), and ending at 1:00:00 p.m., New York time, on the delivery date of the applicable conversion notice; provided however, during the period through and including January 24, 2017 to February 15, 2017, the conversion price shall not be lowered to an amount lower than 90% of the volume weighted average price of the common stock on the delivery date of the applicable conversion notice.\nFor conversions at the election of the holder that are not subject to a floor price pursuant to the terms of the 2016 Notes as originally issued, and at the current conversion price of $0.00068 per share as of March 17, 2017 for such conversions, the $32.2 million in principal amount of 2016 Notes would be convertible into 47.4 billion shares of our common stock. For conversions in relation to the 2016 Notes amortization payments on the convertible notes, if the stock price continues to decline, the number of pre-split equivalent shares of common stock issued could be significantly higher than 47.4 billion shares. If we don\u2019t have sufficient authorized capital to issue these shares we would need to seek another reverse stock split which would result in further substantial dilution to shareholders, an increase in our authorized share capital or settle the 2016 Notes in cash, if available.\nFurther, we issued Series D and 2015 Subordination warrants issuable to acquire 17.1% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a fully-diluted basis, which were subject to a one time reset on December 31, 2016 to 17.1% of our fully diluted shares of common stock on that date. As of March 17, 2017, following such adjustment, the Series D and 2015 Subordination warrants were exercisable to acquire 2,432,599 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.00068 per share, subject to adjustment for subsequent issuances.\nFurther in connection with the 2016 Note, the Series H warrants that were issued in July 2016 became exercisable as of January 1, 2017. The Series H warrants are exercisable into 2,346 shares of common stock at the current exercise price of $0.00068 per share, subject to adjustment for certain subsequent issuances.\nThe Series F Preferred Stock is currently convertible at the election of the holder into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to $0.00068, subject to adjustments. From and after July 3, 2017, the Series F Preferred Stock shall be convertible at a conversion price equal to 85% of the arithmetic average, in each case of the lower of (i) the three lowest daily weighted average prices of the our common stock during the twenty (20) consecutive trading day period ending on the trading day immediately preceding the date of determination and (iii) the weighted average price of the our common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the date of determination. On November 3, 2016, 2,098 Series F Preferred shares were mandatorily converted into 349,667 shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $6.00 per share. On November 3, 2018, so long as no Triggering Event then exists, any remaining Preferred Shares then outstanding shall be converted into shares of our common stock at a conversion\nprice of $6.00 per share. In each case, shares of our common stock will be held in abeyance to the extent necessary to satisfy limitations on beneficial ownership as described in the Certificate of Designations for the Series F Preferred Stock. As of March 17, 2017 we had converted 2,576 Series F Preferred Shares into 429,334 shares of common stock. As of March 17, 2017, based on 5,860 shares of Series F Preferred Stock issued and outstanding, at a conversion price of $0.00068 per share, we could potentially issue up to 8.6 billion shares of our common stock on conversion of Series F Preferred Stock. If the stock price declines following the Reverse Stock Split, the number of pre-split equivalent shares of Common Stock issued could be significantly higher than 8.6 billion.\nDue to the variable nature of the adjustments of the 2016 Notes and Series F Preferred Stock conversion prices and the formula which sets certain conversion prices of these securities based on a discount to the then current market price, the Company could issue substantially more shares of common stock upon conversion of these securities than anticipated above. This is especially the case when the Company conducts reverse stock splits which may increase the per share price in the market but the price may subsequently drop below the immediate post-split price. Although we have the option to settle the principal payments on the 2016 Notes in cash and certain conversion and exercise restrictions are placed upon the holders of the 2016 Notes, Series F Preferred Stock, Series D Warrants and Series H Warrants, the issuance of material amounts of common stock by us would cause our stockholders to experience significant dilution in their investment in the Company.\nWe may be at risk of securities class action litigation.\nWe may be at risk of securities class action litigation. This risk is especially relevant for us due to our dependence on positive clinical trial outcomes and regulatory approvals of our diagnostic tests. In the past, life science companies have experienced significant stock price volatility, particularly when associated with binary events such as clinical trials and product approvals. Additionally, due to our price volatility and our high demand for cash to fund operations, we have had to conduct a number of reverse stock splits and highly dilutive financings to continue as a going concern which exposes us to additional risk of securities class action litigation. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business and results in a decline in the market price of our common stock. If such lawsuits were successful we may not be able to pay awarded damages and we may be forced into bankruptcy which would likely result in the complete loss of your investment.\nMarket and economic conditions may negatively impact our business, financial condition and share price.\nIn recent years, concerns over inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the U.S. mortgage market and a declining real estate market, unstable global credit markets and financial conditions, and volatile oil prices have led to periods of significant economic instability, diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence and discretionary spending, diminished expectations for the global economy and expectations of slower global economic growth going forward, increased unemployment rates, and increased credit defaults. Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by any such economic downturns, volatile business environments and unstable or unpredictable economic and market conditions. If these conditions occur, deteriorate or do not improve, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to complete, more costly, and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, financial performance, and share price and could require us to delay or abandon development or commercialization plans. In addition, there is a risk that one or more of our current and future service providers, manufacturers, suppliers, hospitals and other medical facilities, our third party payors, and other partners could be negatively affected by these difficult economic times, which could adversely affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget or meet our business and financial objectives.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards is limited.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had federal income tax net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards of approximately $46.7 million and state income tax NOL carryforwards of approximately $41.6 million. These NOL carryforwards, if not previously used, will begin to expire in 2023. During 2015 we experienced a shift in our stock ownership within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, or under\napplicable state tax laws that currently subject our NOL carryforwards to an annual limitation. Accordingly, we were required to write off $23.2 million of net operating loss carryforwards. If we experience a shift in our stock ownership and earn net taxable income in the future, the limitations on our ability to use our NOL carryforwards to reduce U.S. federal and state tax liabilities will result in increased future tax liability to us.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that, if not properly remediated, could result in material misstatements in our financial statements in future periods.\nManagement identified the following material weakness that continues to be a material weakness as of December 31, 2016:\n\u2022\nWe did not design and maintain effective controls to analyze complex and non-routine transactions or adequately review the accounting and/or disclosure for these transactions. The nature of our financing agreements increases the complexity of our accounting for potential fair value liabilities. As we enter into additional equity or debt financing transactions, which may have contractual provisions different from those of our existing financing instruments, the accounting and valuation of these financial instruments may become increasingly complicated. This additional complexity could increase the chance that we experience additional errors in the future, particularly because we have a material weakness in our internal control.\nBecause of the material weakness described above, management concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nWith respect to the remediation of the material weakness, we have hired additional accounting and IT personnel to help improve our segregation of duties. We continue to engage third-party consultants to assist us with our evaluation of complex technical accounting matters, including the valuation and accounting for our complex derivative agreements. We also continue to engage consultants to advise us on making further improvements to our internal control over financial reporting. We believe that these additional resources will enable us to broaden the scope and quality of our controls relating to the oversight and review of financial statements and our application of relevant accounting policies. These remediation efforts are still in process and have not yet been completed. We cannot assure you that the steps taken will remediate such weakness, nor can we be certain of whether additional actions will be required or the costs of any such actions.\nWe may need to take additional measures to fully mitigate these issues, and the measures we have taken, and expect to take, to improve our internal controls may not be sufficient to address the issues identified, to ensure that our internal controls are effective or to ensure that the identified material weaknesses or significant deficiencies or other material weaknesses or deficiencies will not result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements. In addition, other material weaknesses or deficiencies may be identified in the future. If we are unable to correct material weaknesses or deficiencies in internal controls in a timely manner, our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information accurately and within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC will be adversely affected, and could result in material misstatements in our financial statements in future periods. This failure could negatively affect the market price and trading liquidity of our common stock, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, subject us to civil and criminal investigations and penalties, and generally materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Convertible Note Financings\nOur obligations to the holders of our 2016 Notes are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets, so if we default on those obligations, the convertible note holders could foreclose on our assets.\nOur obligations under the 2016 Notes and the transaction documents relating to those convertible notes are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets. As a result, if we default under our obligations under the 2016\nNotes or the transaction documents, the holders of such convertible notes, acting through their appointed agent, could foreclose on their security interests and liquidate some or all of these assets, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and could require us to reduce or cease operations.\nThe holders of the 2016 Notes have certain additional rights upon an event of default under such convertible notes which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and could require us to reduce or cease or operations.\nUnder the 2016 Notes, the holders have certain rights upon an event of default. Such rights include (i) the remaining principal amount of the convertible notes bearing interest at a rate of 10% per annum, (ii) during the event of default the conversion price being adjusted to the lowest of (a) the conversion price then in effect, (b) 75% of the lowest weighted average price of the common stock during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the trading day immediately preceding the date of the event of default conversion and (c) 75% of the weighted average price of the common stock on the date of the applicable event of default conversion, and (iii) the holder having the right to demand redemption of all or a portion of the convertible notes, as described below. At any time after certain notice requirements for an event of default are triggered, a holder of convertible notes may require us to redeem all or any portion of the convertible note by delivering written notice. Each portion of the convertible note subject to redemption would be redeemed by us in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds at a price equal to the greater of (x) 125% of the conversion amount being redeemed and (y) the product of (A) the conversion amount being redeemed and (B) the quotient determined by dividing (I) the greatest closing price of the shares of common stock during the period beginning on the date immediately preceding such event of default and ending on the date the holder delivers the redemption notice, by (II) the lowest conversion price in effect during such period. We may not have sufficient funds to settle the redemption price and, as described above, this could trigger rights under the security interest granted to the holders and result in the foreclosure of their security interests and liquidation of some or all of our assets.\nThe exercise of any of these rights upon an event of default could substantially harm our financial condition and force us to reduce or cease operations.\nThe Company is in default as of February 28, 2017 on the dollar value of daily trading and stock price requirement in the equity conditions under the 2016 Notes. If the Company does not obtain a waiver or an amendment to equity conditions to lower the stock price requirement, then the Company will not be able to convert amortization payments under the 2016 Notes and the restrictions on cash held in the Company\u2019s restricted accounts will not be released, either of which will harm our financial condition, could force us to declare bankruptcy and could result in the loss of your entire investment.\nThe release of restrictions on cash held in the Company\u2019s restricted accounts on certain dates under the terms of the 2016 Notes depends upon the Company\u2019s satisfaction of certain equity conditions as set forth in the 2016 Notes. If the Company does not meet these equity conditions, then the cash will not become available to the Company. Two of those equity conditions are that the Company\u2019s shares of common stock have a dollar value of daily trading volume of at least $800,000 and a 5-day weighted average price of $31,200 (adjusted for the Company\u2019s reverse stock splits) during certain equity condition measurement periods. The Company obtained a waiver on January 9, 2017, to these equity conditions which extended through February 28, 2017 and has now expired. As of March 17, 2017, the Company\u2019s common stock closed at $0.001 per share and the dollar value of daily trading volume was $17,172. If the Company does not receive a new waiver or an amendment to the 2016 Notes which amends these equity conditions, then the Company will not be able to convert amortization payments under the 2016 Notes, which would require settlement of the payments in cash. Further, the Company would not meet the requirements to receive the release of the restrictions on cash in the restricted accounts. If the Company does not have sufficient cash to pay the amortization payments when due and payable under the 2016, then an Event of Default (as defined in the 2016 Notes) would occur and the holders of the 2016 Notes would be able to exercise their rights under the 2016 Notes, including but not limited to demanding immediate payment of the entire aggregate principal amount of the 2016 Notes and exercising rights under the security agreement over the Company\u2019s assets.\nFurther, if the Company doesn\u2019t receive the release of restrictions on cash in the restricted accounts, then the Company likely would need to raise more capital to continue as a going concern. Any of the above events would substantially harm our financial position and could result in the Company declaring bankruptcy.\nRisk Related to Our Series F Preferred Stock\nHolders of our Series F Preferred Stock have certain additional rights upon the occurrence of certain triggering events which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and could require us to reduce or cease or operations.\nUnder the Certificate of Designations for the Series F Preferred Stock, the holders will have certain rights upon a \u201cTriggering Event\u201d (as defined in the Certificate of Designations for the Series F Preferred Stock). Such rights include (i) the remaining principal amount of the Series F Preferred Stock bearing interest at a rate of 10% per annum, (ii) during the Triggering Event the conversion price being adjusted to the lowest of (a) the conversion price then in effect, (b) 75% of the lowest weighted average price of the our common stock during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the trading day immediately preceding the date of the Triggering Event conversion and (c) 75% of the weighted average price of the our common stock on the date of the applicable Triggering Event conversion, and (iii) the holder having the right to demand redemption of all or any number of the preferred shares.\nAt any time after the earlier of the holder\u2019s receipt of a notice of an Triggering Event and the holder becoming aware of an Triggering Event and ending on the 15th trading day after the later of (x) the date such Triggering Event is cured and (y) the holder\u2019s receipt of an Triggering Event notice, the holder may require the Company to redeem all or any number of the preferred shares at a price equal to the greater of (x) 125% of the conversion amount being redeemed and (y) the product of (A) the conversion amount being redeemed and (B) the quotient determined by dividing (I) the greatest closing price of the shares of our common stock during the period beginning on the date immediately preceding such Triggering Event and ending on the date the holder delivers the redemption notice, by (II) the lowest conversion price in effect during such period.\n\u201cTriggering Event\u201d includes, but is not limited to (and subject to the ability to cure in certain instances): (i) (A) the suspension from trading for more than an aggregate of ten (10) trading days in any 365-day period or (B) the failure of the our common stock to be listed on an eligible market; (ii) the Company\u2019s (i) failure to convert the Series F Preferred Shares or related warrants by delivery of the required number of shares of our common stock within five (5) trading days after the applicable conversion or exercise date, (ii) notice of its intention not to comply with a request for conversion or exercise of the Series F Preferred Stock or related warrants or (iii) the Company fails to have sufficient authorized shares to convert the Series F Preferred Stock and related warrants in full for 75 consecutive days. (iii) any payment failure; (iv) any default under, redemption of or acceleration prior to maturity of more than $100,000, individually or in the aggregate, of Indebtedness of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; (v) certain bankruptcy events; (vii) a final judgment or judgments for the payment of money aggregating in excess of $250,000, individually or in the aggregate, are rendered against the Company or any of its subsidiaries and which judgments are not, within sixty (60) days after the entry thereof, bonded, discharged or stayed pending appeal, or are not discharged within seventy-five (75) days after the expiration of such stay; provided, however, that any judgment which is covered by insurance or an indemnity from a credit worthy party shall not be included in calculating the $250,000 amount set forth above so long as the Company provides each holder a written statement from such insurer or indemnity provider (which written statement shall be reasonably satisfactory to such holder) to the effect that such judgment is covered by insurance or an indemnity and the Company will receive the proceeds of such insurance or indemnity within forty-five (45) days of the issuance of such judgment; (viii) breaches of representations, warranties and covenants in the Certificate of Designations for the Series F Preferred Stock and related transaction documents; or (ix) the Company\u2019s failure for any reason after the date that is six (6) months immediately following the issuance date to satisfy the current public information requirement under Rule 144(c) of the Securities Act.\nThe triggering and exercise of any of these rights could substantially harm our financial condition and force us to reduce or cease operations.\nHolders of our Series F Preferred Stock have voting rights on an as converted basis. These rights permit the holders of the Series F Preferred Stock to vote up to certain percentage of our outstanding voting securities.\nThe holders of the Series F Preferred Stock may have interests in matters brought before the shareholders that are different than holders of common stock. The holders of Series F Preferred Stock have the right to vote with holders of shares of our common stock, voting together as one class on all matters, with each share of Series F Preferred share entitling the holder thereof to cast that number of votes per share as is equal to the aggregate number of stock of our common stock into which it is then convertible (without regard to any limitations on conversion set forth in the Certificate of Designations for the Series F Preferred Stock including without limitation, the maximum percentage and/or the failure to have a sufficient number of shares of common stock reserved or available for issuance pursuant to the Certificate of Designations for the Series F Preferred Stock) using the record date for determining the stockholders of the Company eligible to vote on such matters as the date as of which the conversion price is calculated; provided, that no holder (together with such holder\u2019s attribution parties) shall be permitted to have a number of votes in excess of such aggregate number of votes granted to the holders of 9.99% of the shares our common stock then outstanding (including any votes with respect to any shares of our common stock and preferred stock beneficially owned by the holder or such holder\u2019s attribution parties).\nThe holders of the Series F Preferred Stock may have interests in matters brought before the stockholders that are different than the interests of holders of our common stock. Specifically, the holders of our Series F Preferred Stock are also holders of our 2016 Notes and their interests in relation to stockholder matters that affect the 2016 Notes will be different than the interests of holders of our common stock. While the Series F Preferred Stock holders do not act as a group, in the instances where their interests are aligned, their ability to cast votes on an as converted basis may affect the outcome of any stockholder votes on such matters.\nRisks Related to Owning our Common Stock and Other Securities\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuation in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Some factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, in addition to the other risks mentioned in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this report, are:\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by our stockholders, executives, and directors;\n\u2022\nconversions of the 2016 Notes into shares of common stock and subsequent sales of such shares by such holders;\n\u2022\nvolatility and limitations in trading volumes of our shares of common stock or units;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u2022\nour ability to enter new markets;\n\u2022\nactual or unanticipated fluctuations in our annual and quarterly financial results;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain financings to continue and expand our commercial activities, expand our manufacturing operations, conduct and complete research and development activities including, but not limited to, our human clinical trials, and other business activities;\n\u2022\nour ability to secure resources and the necessary personnel to continue and expand our commercial activities, develop additional assays, conduct clinical trials and gain approval for our additional assays on our desired schedule;\n\u2022\ncommencement, enrollment or results of our clinical trials of our assays or any future clinical trials we may conduct;\n\u2022\nchanges in the development status of our assays;\n\u2022\nany delays or adverse developments or perceived adverse developments with respect to the FDA\u2019s review of our planned clinical trials;\n\u2022\nany delay in our submission for studies or test approvals or adverse regulatory decisions, including failure to receive regulatory approval for our assays;\n\u2022\nour announcements or our competitors\u2019 announcements regarding new assays, enhancements, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments;\n\u2022\nunanticipated safety concerns related to our assays;\n\u2022\nfailures to meet external expectations or management guidance;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure or dividend policy, including as a result of future issuances of securities and sales of large blocks of common stock by our stockholders;\n\u2022\nour cash position;\n\u2022\nannouncements and events surrounding financing efforts, including debt and equity securities;\n\u2022\nour inability to enter into new markets or develop new assays;\n\u2022\nreputational issues;\n\u2022\ncompetition from existing technologies and assays or new technologies and assays that may emerge;\n\u2022\nannouncements of acquisitions, partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures, new assays, capital commitments, or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic, political and market conditions in any of the regions in which we conduct our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in industry conditions or perceptions;\n\u2022\nchanges in valuations of similar companies or groups of companies;\n\u2022\nanalyst research reports, recommendations and changes in recommendations, price targets and withdrawals of coverage;\n\u2022\ndepartures and additions of key personnel;\n\u2022\ndisputes and litigations related to intellectual properties, proprietary rights and contractual obligations;\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable laws, rules, regulations, or accounting practices and other dynamics;\n\u2022\nannouncements or actions taken by our principal stockholders; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, many of which may be out of our control.\nIn addition, if any of the market for stocks in our industry or industries related to our industry, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management.\nCertain of our outstanding warrants and convertible securities have anti-dilution provisions triggered by the issuance of shares of common stock and securities exercisable for shares of our common stock at prices below the then current exercise prices for such warrants, pursuant to which the exercise price of such warrants or conversion price of such convertible securities will be adjusted downward and could make it more likely that such warrants are exercised or such convertible securities are converted and dilute our current stockholders.\nThe exercise price for each of the Class A Warrants, Class B Warrants, Series D Warrants, Series G Warrants, Series H Warrants, certain other warrants, 2015 Subordination Warrants and 2016 Subordination Warrants and the conversion price of the Series F Preferred Stock and 2016 Notes is subject to adjustment in the event we issue common stock or securities convertible into common stock at a price lower than the then-current exercise price or conversion price, as the case may be. The exercise price of the Series B Warrants is subject to adjustment in the\nevent we issue common stock or securities convertible into common stock at a price lower than the current market price.\nIf we issue shares of common stock or securities exercisable or convertible for shares of common stock that trigger these provisions, then the exercise price for these warrants and conversion price for the 2016 Notes and the Series F Preferred Stock will be reduced according to their provisions, in most cases, to the per share price of the triggering transaction. A reduction in the exercise price of these warrants and other securities will make it more likely that they are exercised or converted resulting in further dilution to our then current stockholders.\nBroker-dealers may be discouraged from effecting transactions in our shares of common stock because they are considered a penny stock and are subject to the penny stock rules.\nOur shares of common stock are currently considered a \u201cpenny stock.\u201d The SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. The shares of common stock are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and \u201caccredited investors.\u201d The term \u201caccredited investor\u201d refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer\u2019s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the shares of common stock. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade in the shares of common stock.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our share price to fall.\nWe expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations, including expanding research and development, funding clinical trials, purchasing of capital equipment, hiring new personnel, commercializing our diagnostic tests, and continuing activities as an operating public company. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our shares of common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our shares.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the increase, if any, of our share price.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and will be able to avail ourselves of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Investors may find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our IPO; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nWe have elected to use the extended transition periods for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\nWe have elected to use the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transaction period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B). As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nOur management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a newly formed entity. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, have imposed various new requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these new compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly. We expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage.\nProvisions of our Seventh Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, our Amended and Restated Bylaws and Delaware law could make an acquisition of our Company, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove the current members of our board of directors and management.\nCertain provisions of our Seventh Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or our Certificate, and our Amended and Restated Bylaws (our \u201cBylaws\u201d), could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change of control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. Furthermore, these provisions could prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our board of directors. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. Stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so. These provisions:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors, such that not all members of the board of directors may be elected at one time;\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue without stockholder approval up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred\nstock, the rights of which will be determined at the discretion of the board of directors that, if issued, could operate as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that is not approved by our board of directors;\n\u2022\nrequire that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting or by written consent of the stockholders if such action has been earlier approved by the board of directors;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to our board of directors or for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nlimit who may call stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of the holders of at least sixty percent of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote in order to amend certain provisions of our Certificate and at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock to amend certain provisions of our Bylaws.\nIn addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may, unless certain criteria are met, prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of the voting rights on our common stock, from merging or combining with us for a prescribed period of time.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have a limited commercial history upon which to base our prospects, have not generated profits and do not expect to generate profits for the foreseeable future. We may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe began operations in January 2005, and we have a limited operating history. We have not earned significant revenue to-date, and do not expect to earn significant revenue in the near future. We had a net loss for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 of approximately $89.1 million and $57.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $211.1 million. Investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by a new enterprise, many of which are beyond our control, including substantial risks and expenses in the course of developing new diagnostic tests, establishing or entering new markets, organizing operations and marketing procedures. The likelihood of our success must be considered in light of these risks, expenses, complications and delays, and the competitive environment in which we operate. There is, therefore, nothing at this time upon which to base an assumption that our business plan will prove successful, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue, raise additional capital or operate profitably. We will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by early commercial stage companies, including scaling up our infrastructure and headcount, and may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties or delays in connection with our growth. In addition, as a result of the start-up nature of our business, we can be expected to continue to sustain substantial operating expenses without generating sufficient revenues to cover expenditures. As discussed in Note 3 to the audited financial statements, our recurring operating losses from operations and our need for additional sources of capital to fund our ongoing operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Any investment in our Company is therefore highly speculative and could result in the loss of your entire investment.\nOur near-term success is dependent upon our ability to expand our customer base.\nOur current customer base is composed of hospitals and testing laboratories that use our C. diff, Group B Strep and other assays. Our success will depend, in part, upon our ability to expand our customer base and increase revenue by adding new products. Attracting new customers requires substantial time and expense. Any failure to expand our existing customer base would adversely affect our operating results. Many factors could affect the market acceptance and commercial success of our assays, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to convince our potential customers of the advantages and economic value of our analyzers and assays over competing technologies and diagnostic assays;\n\u2022\nthe breadth of our assay menu relative to competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges to policies, procedures or currently accepted best practices in clinical diagnostics;\n\u2022\nthe extent and success of our marketing and sales efforts;\n\u2022\nour ability to manufacture analyzers for use by potential customers during the sales evaluation phase; and\n\u2022\nour ability to manufacture our commercial diagnostic cartridges and meet demand in a timely fashion.\nIf we cannot successfully develop, maintain, commercialize, or obtain regulatory approvals for new and existing diagnostic assays, our financial results will be harmed and our ability to compete will be harmed.\nOur financial performance depends in part upon our ability to successfully develop and market new assays in a rapidly changing technological and economic environment, and to maintain and successfully commercialize previously cleared assays. If we fail to successfully introduce new assays or do not maintain approval for previously FDA-cleared assays, we could lose customers and market share. We could also lose market share if our competitors introduce new assays or technologies that render our assays less competitive or obsolete. In addition, delays in the introduction of new assays due to regulatory, developmental or other obstacles could negatively impact our revenue and market share, as well as our earnings. Factors that can influence our ability to introduce new assays, the timing associated with new product approvals and commercial success of these assays include:\n\u2022\nthe scope of and progress made in our research and development activities;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully initiate and complete clinical trial studies;\n\u2022\ntimely expansion of our menu of assays;\n\u2022\nthe results of clinical trials needed to support any regulatory approvals of our assays;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain and maintain requisite FDA or other regulatory clearances or approvals for our assays on a timely basis;\n\u2022\ndemand for the new assays we introduce;\n\u2022\nproduct offerings from our competitors; and\n\u2022\nthe functionality of new assays that address market requirements and customer demands.\nWe are subject to many laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.\nOur assays for C. diff, Group B Strep, Staph ID/R and STEC and any assays that we develop and commercialize in the future are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA and comparable foreign agencies. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of our assays. In particular, FDA regulations govern activities such as product development, product testing, product labeling, product storage, premarket clearance or approval, manufacturing, advertising, promotion, product sales, reporting of certain product failures and distribution. Our assays will require 510(k) clearance from the FDA prior to marketing. Clinical trials are required to support a 510(k) submission.\nWe may be unable to obtain marketing clearance for our assays in development. If such approval is obtained, it may:\n\u2022\ntake a significant amount of time;\n\u2022\nrequire the expenditure of substantial resources;\n\u2022\ninvolve stringent clinical and pre-clinical testing;\n\u2022\ninvolve modifications, repairs, or replacements of our assays; and/or\n\u2022\nresult in limitations on the proposed uses of our assays.\nOur facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies and conformance to the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation (the \u201cQSR\u201d) and current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements, as well as applicable foreign or international standards. The results of these inspections can include inspectional observations\nregarding potential violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the \u201cFDCA\u201d) and related laws, warning letters, restrictions on medical device sales and other forms of enforcement.\nSince 2009, the FDA has significantly increased its oversight of companies subject to its regulations, including medical device companies, by hiring new investigators and stepping up inspections of manufacturing facilities. The FDA has recently also significantly increased the number of warning letters issued to companies. If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could ban such medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such devices, refuse to grant pending pre-market approval applications or require certificates of foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees or us. The FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our diagnostic tests.\nForeign governmental regulations have become increasingly stringent and more common, and we may become subject to more rigorous regulation by foreign governmental authorities in the future. Penalties for a company\u2019s non-compliance with foreign governmental regulation could be severe, including revocation or suspension of a company\u2019s business license and criminal sanctions. Any domestic or foreign governmental law or regulation imposed in the future may have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur current and potential customers in the United States and elsewhere may also be subject, directly or indirectly, to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, transparency, health information privacy and security and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings.\nThe life sciences industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. If our competitors and potential competitors develop superior assays and technologies, our competitive position and results of operations would suffer.\nWe face intense competition from a number of companies that offer assays in our target markets, many of which have substantially greater financial resources and larger, more established marketing, sales and service operations than we do. The life sciences industry is characterized by rapid and continuous technological innovation. We may need to develop new technologies for our existing product and our assays to be competitive. One or more of our current or future competitors could render our existing products or assays under development obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances. We may also encounter other problems in the process of delivering new assays to the marketplace, such as problems related to FDA clearance or regulations, design, development or manufacturing of such assays, and as a result we may be unsuccessful in selling such assays. Our future success depends on our ability to compete effectively against current technologies, as well as to respond effectively to technological advances by developing and marketing assays that are competitive in the continually changing technological landscape.\nIf our assays do not perform as expected or the reliability of the technology on which our assays are based is questioned, we could experience delayed or reduced market acceptance of our assays, increased costs and damage to our reputation.\nOur success depends on the market\u2019s confidence that we can provide reliable, high-quality analyzers and diagnostic cartridges. We believe that customers in our target markets are likely to be particularly sensitive to product defects and errors. Our reputation and the public image of our assays or technologies may be impaired if our assays fail to perform as expected or our assays are perceived as difficult to use. Despite quality control testing, defects or errors could occur in our assays or technologies.\nIn the future, if our assays experience a material defect or error, this could result in loss or delay of revenues, delayed market acceptance, product recalls, damaged reputation, diversion of development resources, legal claims, increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs, any of which could harm our business. Such defects or errors could also prompt us to amend certain warning labels or narrow the scope of the use of our assays, either of which could hinder our success in the market. Even after any underlying concerns or problems are resolved, any widespread concerns regarding our technology or any manufacturing defects or performance errors in our assays could result in lost revenue, delayed market acceptance, damaged reputation, increased service and warranty costs and claims against us.\nIf our international distributor relationships are not successful, our ability to market and sell our assays will be harmed and our financial performance will be adversely affected.\nOutside of the United States, we depend on relationships with distributors for the marketing and sales of our assays in various geographic regions, and we have a limited ability to influence their efforts. Relying on distributors for our sales and marketing could harm our business for various reasons, including:\n\u2022\nagreements with distributors may terminate prematurely due to disagreements or may result in litigation between the partners;\n\u2022\nour distributors may not devote sufficient resources to the sale of our assays;\n\u2022\nour distributors may be unsuccessful in marketing our assays; and\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to negotiate future distributor agreements on acceptable terms.\nIf any of our products, or the malfunctioning of our products, causes or contributes to a death or a serious injury, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions.\nUnder the FDA medical device reporting regulations, medical device manufacturers are required to report to the FDA information that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device were to recur. If we fail to report these events to the FDA within the required timeframes, or at all, FDA could take enforcement action against us. Any such adverse event involving our assays could also result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nOur assays may in the future be subject to product recalls. A recall of our products, either voluntarily or at the direction of the FDA or another governmental authority, including a third-country authority, or the discovery of serious safety issues with our products, could have a significant adverse impact on us.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. In the case of the FDA, the authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is reasonable probability that the device would cause serious injury or death. In addition, foreign governmental bodies have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. The FDA requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the FDA within ten working days after the recall is initiated. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our international distributors could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, malfunctions, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of any of our assays would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition, which could impair our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet our customers\u2019 demands. We may also be subject to liability claims, be required to bear other costs, or take other actions that may have a negative impact\non our future sales and our ability to generate profits. Companies are required to maintain certain records of recalls, even if they are not reportable to the FDA or another third-country competent authority. We may initiate voluntary recalls involving our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA or another third-country competent authority. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, it could require us to report those actions as recalls. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales. In addition, the FDA could take enforcement action for failing to report the recalls when they occur. We are also required to follow detailed recordkeeping requirements for all Company-initiated medical device corrections and removals. In addition, in December 2012, the FDA issued a draft guidance intended to assist the FDA and industry in distinguishing medical device recalls from product enhancements. Per the guidance, if any change or group of changes to a device that addresses a violation of the FDCA, that change would generally constitute a medical device recall and require submission of a recall report to the FDA.\nIf we become subject to claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of hazardous materials, we could incur significant cost and time to comply.\nOur research and development processes involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials, including biological hazardous materials. We are subject to foreign, federal, state and local regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of materials and waste products. We may incur significant costs complying with both existing and future environmental laws and regulations. In particular, we are subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, and the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, and to regulation under the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in the United States. OSHA or the EPA may adopt additional regulations in the future that may affect our research and development programs. The risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous materials cannot be eliminated completely. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and any liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the coverage of our workers\u2019 compensation insurance. We may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, if at all.\nOur diagnostic cartridges have not been manufactured on a high volume scale and are subject to unforeseen scale-up risks.\nAlthough we have developed a process to manufacture diagnostic cartridges for our current volume of sales, there can be no assurance that we can manufacture our diagnostic cartridges at a scale that is adequate for our future commercial needs. We may face significant or unforeseen difficulties in manufacturing our diagnostic cartridges, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\ntechnical issues relating to manufacturing components of our diagnostic cartridges on a high volume commercial scale at reasonable cost, and in a reasonable time frame;\n\u2022\ndifficulty meeting demand or timing requirements for orders due to excessive costs or lack of capacity for part or all of an operation or process;\n\u2022\nlack of skilled labor or unexpected increases in labor costs needed to produce or maintain our analyzers or perform certain required operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulations or in quality or other requirements that lead to additional manufacturing costs or an inability to supply product in a timely manner, if at all; and\n\u2022\nincreases in raw material or component supply cost or an inability to obtain supplies of certain critical supplies needed to complete our manufacturing processes.\nThese and other difficulties may only become apparent when scaling up to the manufacturing process of our diagnostic cartridges to a more substantive commercial scale. If our diagnostic cartridges cannot be manufactured in sufficient commercial quantities or manufacturing is delayed, our future prospects could be significantly impacted and our financial prospects would be materially harmed.\nWe or our suppliers may experience development or manufacturing problems or delays that could limit the growth of our revenue or increase our losses.\nWe may encounter unforeseen situations in the manufacturing of our diagnostic cartridges that could result in delays or shortfalls in our production. Our suppliers may also face similar delays or shortfalls. In addition, our or our suppliers\u2019 production processes may have to change to accommodate any significant future expansion of our manufacturing capacity, which may increase our or our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing costs, delay production of our diagnostic cartridges, reduce our product gross margin and adversely impact our business. If we are unable to satisfy demand for our diagnostic cartridges by successfully manufacturing and shipping our diagnostic cartridges in a timely manner, our revenue could be impaired, market acceptance for our assays could be adversely affected and our customers might instead purchase our competitors\u2019 assays. In addition, developing manufacturing procedures for assays under development may require developing specific production processes for those assays. Developing such processes could be time consuming and any unexpected difficulty in doing so can delay the introduction of a product.\nWe are dependent on single source suppliers for some of the components and materials used in our assays, and supply chain interruptions could negatively impact our operations and financial performance.\nOur assays are manufactured by us and we obtain supplies from a limited number of suppliers. In some cases, critical components required to manufacture our assays may only be available from a sole supplier or limited number of suppliers, any of whom would be difficult to replace. The supply of any of our manufacturing materials may be interrupted because of poor vendor performance or other events outside our control, which may require us, among other things, to identify alternate vendors and result in lost sales and increased expenses. Even if the manufacturing materials that we source are available from other parties, the time and effort involved in validating the new supplies and obtaining any necessary regulatory approvals for substitutes could impede our ability to replace such components in a timely manner or at all.\nWe expect to rely on third parties to conduct studies of our assays under development that will be required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct the field trial studies or other studies that may be required to obtain FDA and other regulatory clearances or approvals for our assays. Accordingly, we expect to rely on third parties, such as independent testing laboratories and hospitals, to conduct such studies. Our reliance on these third parties will reduce our control over these activities. These third-party contractors may not complete activities on schedule or conduct studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our study design. We cannot control whether they devote sufficient time, skill and resources to our studies. Our reliance on third parties that we do not control will not relieve us of any applicable requirement to prepare, and ensure compliance with, various procedures required under good clinical practices. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if the third parties need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our studies may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for additional assays.\nAny clinical trials that we may conduct may not begin on time, or at all, may not be completed on schedule, or at all, or may be more expensive than we expect, which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our assays or impair our financial position.\nThe commencement or completion of any clinical trials that we may conduct may be delayed or halted for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe FDA or other regulatory authorities suspend or place on hold a clinical trial, or do not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial;\n\u2022\nthe data and safety monitoring committee or applicable hospital institutional ethics review board recommends that a trial be placed on hold or suspended;\n\u2022\nfewer patients meet our clinical study criteria and our enrollment rate is lower than we expected;\n\u2022\nclinical trial sites decide not to participate or cease participation in a clinical trial;\n\u2022\nthird-party clinical investigators do not perform our clinical trials on schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol and good clinical practices, or other third-party organizations do not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u2022\nwe fail regulatory inspections of our manufacturing facilities requiring us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninterim results of the clinical trial are inconclusive or negative;\n\u2022\npre-clinical or clinical data are interpreted by third parties in unanticipated ways; or\n\u2022\nour trial design is inadequate to demonstrate safety and/or efficacy.\nOur clinical trial costs will increase if we have material delays in those trials or if we need to perform more or larger trials than planned. Adverse events during a clinical trial could cause us to repeat a trial, terminate a trial or cancel an entire program. Should our clinical development plan be delayed, this could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nProduct liability claims could adversely impact our financial condition and our earnings and impair our reputation.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices. Device failures, manufacturing defects, design flaws, or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information with respect to our assays could result in an unsafe condition regarding, injury to, or death of, a patient. The occurrence of such a problem could result in product liability claims or a recall of, or safety alert relating to, one or more of our assays. Product liability claims or product recalls in the future, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers for our assays.\nHealthcare policy changes, including U.S. healthcare reform legislation signed in 2010, may have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, or PPACA, were signed into law. The legislation imposes a 2.3% excise tax on medical device manufacturers. This significant tax burden on our industry could have a material, negative impact on our results of operations and our cash flows. Other elements of this legislation, such as comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, payment system reforms, including shared savings pilots, and other provisions, could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered, and may materially impact numerous aspects of our business.\nIn addition, we expect that the new presidential administration and U.S. Congress will seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Affordable Care Act. Since taking office, President Trump has continued to support the repeal of all or portions of the Affordable Care Act. In January 2017, the House and Senate passed a budget resolution that authorizes congressional committees to draft legislation to repeal all or portions of the Affordable Care Act and permits such legislation to pass with a majority vote in the Senate. President Trump has also recently issued an executive order in which he stated that it is his administration\u2019s policy to seek the prompt repeal of the Affordable Care Act and directed executive departments and federal agencies to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act to the maximum extent permitted by law. There is still uncertainty with respect to the impact President Trump\u2019s administration and the U.S. Congress may have, if any, and any changes will likely take time to unfold, and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the Affordable Care Act. However, we cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us.\nAdverse changes in reimbursement policies and procedures by payors may impact our ability to market and sell our assays that are subject to reimbursement.\nHealthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade, and there have been and continue to be proposals by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to decrease costs. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and instituting cost containment measures to control or significantly influence the purchase of medical products and services. For example, the PPACA, among other things, reduced and/or limited Medicare reimbursement to certain providers. The Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by subsequent legislation, further reduces Medicare\u2019s payments to providers by 2 percent through fiscal year 2024. These reductions may reduce providers\u2019 revenues or profits, which could affect their ability to purchase new technologies. Furthermore, the healthcare industry in the United States has experienced a trend toward cost containment as government and private insurers seek to control healthcare costs by imposing lower payment rates and negotiating reduced contract rates with service providers. Legislation could be adopted in the future that limits payments for our products from governmental payors. In addition, commercial payors such as insurance companies, could adopt similar policies that limit reimbursement for medical device manufacturers\u2019 products. Therefore, we cannot be certain that those of our assays that will be subject to reimbursement will be reimbursed at a cost-effective level. We face similar risks relating to adverse changes in reimbursement procedures and policies in other countries where we market or intend to market our assays. Reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly among international markets. Our inability to obtain international reimbursement approval, or any adverse changes in the reimbursement policies of foreign payors, could negatively affect our ability to sell our assays and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nMany healthcare industry companies, including healthcare systems, are consolidating to create new companies with greater market power. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense. These industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price concessions or reductions for diagnostic tests. If we are forced to reduce our prices because of consolidation in the healthcare industry, our projected revenues would decrease and our earnings, financial condition, and/or cash flows would suffer.\nIf we or our distributors do not comply with the U.S. federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including anti-kickback laws for any products approved in the U.S., or with similar foreign laws where we market our products, we could face significant liability.\nThere are numerous United States federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws, false claims, and physician transparency laws. Our relationships with physicians and surgeons, hospitals and our independent distributors are subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including significant fines, damages and monetary penalties and in some instances, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including the Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs.\nHealthcare fraud and abuse regulations are complex, and even minor irregularities can potentially give rise to claims that a statute or prohibition has been violated. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u2022\nthe federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\nfederal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment of government funds that are false or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an\nobligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act of 2009, which, among other things, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nHIPAA also created federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n\u2022\nthe Federal Trade Commission Act and similar laws regulating advertisement and consumer protections;\n\u2022\nthe federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1997, which makes it illegal to offer or provide money or anything of value to officials of foreign governments, foreign political parties, or international organizations with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage; and\n\u2022\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians. Some states, such as California, Massachusetts, Nevada, and Vermont mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs and/or impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. To enforce compliance with the federal laws, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, has recently increased its scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Dealing with investigations can be time and resource consuming and can divert management\u2019s attention from the business. In addition, settlements with the DOJ or other law enforcement agencies have forced healthcare providers to agree to additional onerous compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement. Any violations of these laws, or any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial condition.\nMany foreign countries have enacted similar laws addressing fraud and abuse in the healthcare sector. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance requirements in multiple jurisdictions increases the possibility that we may run afoul of one or more of the requirements.\nThe implementation of the reporting and disclosure obligations of the Physician Payments Sunshine Act/Open Payments provisions of the Health Care Reform Law could adversely affect our business upon commercialization of our product in the U.S.\nThe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires device manufacturers to engage in extensive tracking of payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as physician ownership and investment interests, and public reporting of such data to the\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services annually. Although we have and expect to continue to have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the Physician Payments Sunshine Act requirements and similar state and foreign laws, our compliance with the Physician Payments Sunshine Act and similar state and foreign transparency laws imposes additional costs on us. Additionally, failure to comply with the Physician Payment Sunshine Act or similar state or foreign laws may subject us to monetary penalties.\nOur ability to compete depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.\nOur future success depends on our ability to identify, attract, train, integrate and retain highly qualified technical, development, sales and marketing, managerial and administrative personnel. Competition for highly skilled individuals is extremely intense and we face difficulty identifying and hiring qualified personnel in many areas of our business. We may not be able to hire and retain such personnel at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure. Many of the companies with which we compete for hiring experienced employees have greater resources than we have. If we fail to identify, attract, train, integrate and retain highly qualified and motivated personnel, our reputation could suffer and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur future success also depends on the continued service and performance of our senior management team. The replacement of members of our senior management team likely would involve significant time and costs, and the loss of any these individuals may delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.\nChanges in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Changes in existing tax laws, treaties, regulations or policies or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, or the enactment or adoption of new tax laws, treaties, regulations or policies could materially impact our effective tax rate.\nIf we do not achieve, sustain or successfully manage our anticipated growth, our business and prospects will be harmed.\nIf we are unable to obtain or sustain adequate revenue growth, our financial results could suffer. Furthermore, significant growth will place strains on our management and our operational and financial systems and processes and our operating costs may escalate even faster than planned. If we cannot effectively manage our expanding operations and our costs, we may not be able to grow effectively or we may grow at a slower pace. Additionally, if we do not successfully forecast the timing of regulatory authorization for our additional tests, marketing and subsequent demand for our diagnostic tests or manage our anticipated expenses accordingly, our operating results will be harmed.\nOther companies or institutions have commercial assays or may develop and market novel or improved methods for infectious disease diagnostics, which may make our diagnostic platform less competitive or obsolete.\nThe market for diagnostics is large and established, and our competitors may possess significantly greater financial resources and have larger development and commercialization capabilities than we do. We may be unable to compete effectively against these competitors either because their diagnostic platforms are superior or because they may have more expertise, experience, financial resources or stronger business relationships.\nDemand for our assays depends in part on the operating budgets and hospital-acquired infection rates of our customers, a reduction in which could limit demand for our assays and adversely affect our business.\nIn the near term, we expect that our revenue will be derived primarily from sales of our C. diff, Group B Strep, Staph ID/R and STEC diagnostic assays to hospitals. The demand for our assays will depend in part upon the prevalence\nof C. diff and Group B Strep at the hospitals of these customers and impacted by other factors beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022\nglobal macroeconomic conditions;\n\u2022\ntotal bed days;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory environment;\n\u2022\ndifferences in budgetary cycles;\n\u2022\nmarket-driven pressures to consolidate operations and reduce costs; and\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of new technologies.\nOur operating results may fluctuate due to reductions and delays in expenditures by our customers. Any decrease in our customers\u2019 budgets or expenditures, or in the size, scope or frequency of operating expenditures, could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nNew technologies, techniques or assays could emerge that might offer better combinations of price and performance than our current C. diff, Group B Strep, Staph ID/R and e. coli assays or future assays and analyzers.\nIt is critical to our success that we anticipate changes in technology and customer requirements and to successfully introduce, on a timely and cost-effective basis, new, enhanced and competitive technologies that meet the needs of current and prospective customers. If we do not successfully innovate and introduce new technology into our product lines or manage the transitions to new product offerings, our revenues, results of operations and business will be adversely impacted. Competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as existing companies and competitors develop new or improved diagnostic tests and as new companies enter the market with new technologies.\nDue to our fixed overhead costs and the depreciation of our analyzers at customer sites included in cost of sales and the costs associated with our current hand-build cartridge manufacturing process we have in the past experienced substantial negative gross margins. We will need to increase our sales volumes significantly and automate our cartridge manufacturing process in order to achieve profitability.\nWe had negative gross margins of 164.5% and 124.7% during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The components of our cost of sales include cost of materials, supplies, labor for manufacturing, equipment and facility expenses associated with manufacturing. Facility expenses include allocated overhead comprised of rent, equipment depreciation and utilities. Due to our fixed overhead costs we will continue to experience negative gross margins unless and until we are able to significantly increase our sales volume. In addition, we currently hand-build our diagnostic cartridges. We are working to automate portions of our manufacturing and assembly process, which we believe will reduce our cartridge manufacturing costs. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful in automating our manufacturing process, and our failure to do so will materially limit our ability to reduce our cost of sales in the future.\nIf we experience a significant disruption in our information technology systems or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on information systems to manufacture products, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and respond to customer inquiries. If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers and suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers, which could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nThe extent to which we can protect our business and technologies through intellectual property rights that we own, acquire or license is uncertain.\nWe employ a variety of proprietary and patented technologies and methods in connection with the assays that we sell or are developing. We license some of these technologies from third parties. We cannot provide any assurance that the intellectual property rights that we own or license provide effective protection from competitive threats or that we would prevail in any litigation in which our intellectual property rights are challenged. In addition, we may not be successful in obtaining new proprietary or patented technologies or methods in the future, whether through acquiring ownership or through licenses from third parties.\nOur currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents, and we cannot predict how long it may take for a patent to issue on any of our pending patent applications, assuming a patent does issue.\nOther parties may challenge patents issued or exclusively licensed to us, or courts or administrative agencies may hold our patents or the patents we license on an exclusive basis to be invalid or unenforceable. We may not be successful in defending challenges made against our patents and other intellectual property rights. Any third-party challenge to any of our patents could result in the unenforceability or invalidity of some or all of the claims of such patents and could be time consuming and expensive.\nThe extent to which the patent rights of life sciences companies effectively protect their diagnostic tests and technologies is often highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved.\nNo consistent policy regarding the proper scope of allowable claims of patents held by life sciences companies has emerged to date in the United States. Various courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have rendered decisions that impact the scope of patentability of certain inventions or discoveries relating to diagnostic tests or genomic diagnostic testing. These decisions generally stand for the proposition that inventions that recite laws of nature are not themselves patentable unless they have sufficient additional features that provide practical assurance that the processes are genuine inventive applications of those laws rather than patent drafting efforts designed to monopolize a law of nature itself. What constitutes a \u201csufficient\u201d additional feature for this purpose is uncertain. Although we do not generally rely on gene sequence patents, this evolving case law in the United States may adversely impact our ability to obtain new patents and may facilitate third-party challenges to our existing owned and exclusively licensed patents.\nWe cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in patents we own or in those to which we have exclusive license rights. For example:\n\u2022\nthe inventor(s) named in one or more of our patents or patent applications might not have been the first to have made the relevant invention;\n\u2022\nthe inventor (or his assignee) might not have been the first to file a patent application for the claimed invention;\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative diagnostic tests and technologies or may successfully replicate our product and technologies;\n\u2022\nit is possible that the patents we own or in which have exclusive license rights may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties and found to be invalid or unenforceable;\n\u2022\nany patents we obtain or exclusively license may expire before, or within a limited time period after, the assays and services relating to such patents are commercialized;\n\u2022\nwe may not develop or acquire additional proprietary assays and technologies that are patentable; and\n\u2022\nothers may acquire patents that could be asserted against us in a manner that could have an adverse effect on\nour business.\nChanges in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States or other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property rights.\nOn September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art, may affect patent litigation and switch the U.S. patent system from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system. Under a first-to-file system, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application generally will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether another inventor had made the invention earlier. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, including the first-to-file provisions in particular, only became effective on March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our owned and licensed patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents that we own or license, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nPatent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are not published until at least eighteen months after filing and it is possible for a patent application filed in the United States to be maintained in secrecy until a patent issues on the application. In addition, publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries. We therefore cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications that cover inventions that are the subject of pending applications that we own or exclusively license or that we were the first to invent the technology (if filed prior to the Leahy-Smith Act) or first to file (if filed after the Leahy-Smith Act). Our competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering technology that is similar to or the same as our technology. Any such patent application may have priority over patent applications that we own and, if a patent issues on such patent application, we could be required to obtain a license to such patent in order to carry on our business. If another party has filed a U.S. patent application covering an invention that is similar to, or the same as, an invention that we own, we may have to participate in an interference or other proceeding in the USPTO or a court to determine priority of invention in the United States, for applications and patents made prior to the enactment of the Leahy-Smith Act. For applications and patents made following the enactment of the Leahy-Smith Act, we may have to participate in a derivation proceeding to resolve disputes relating to inventorship. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful, resulting in our inability to obtain or retain any U.S. patent rights with respect to such invention.\nIn addition, the laws of foreign jurisdictions may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than U.S. law does. Publications of discoveries in scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. Moreover, the USPTO might require that the term of a patent issuing from a pending patent application be disclaimed and limited to the term of another patent that is commonly owned or names a common inventor. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, term, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Recent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and product candidates. We seek to protect our proprietary\nposition by filing in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions patent applications related to our novel technologies and product candidates that are important to our business.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. In addition, we may not pursue or obtain patent protection in all major markets. Moreover, in some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing or prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from third parties. In some circumstances, our licensors may have the right to enforce the licensed patents without our involvement or consent, or to decide not to enforce or to allow us to enforce the licensed patents. Therefore, these patents and patent applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If any of our licensors fail to maintain such patents, or lose rights to those patents, the rights that we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated and our right to develop and commercialize any of our product candidates that are the subject of such licensed rights could be adversely affected.\nOur pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. In particular, during prosecution of any patent application, the issuance of any patents based on the application may depend upon our ability to generate additional nonclinical or clinical data that support the patentability of our proposed claims. We may not be able to generate sufficient additional data on a timely basis, or at all. Moreover, changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States or other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nMoreover, we may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the USPTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings or other patent office proceedings or litigation, in the United States or elsewhere, challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission or proceeding could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights; allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us; or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our owned and licensed patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends upon compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent prosecution process and following the issuance of a patent. There are situations in which noncompliance with these requirements can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case if our patent were in force.\nOur intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to protect our competitive position and to prevent others from manufacturing, using or selling competing assays.\nThe scope of our owned and exclusively licensed intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to prevent others from manufacturing, using or selling competing assays. Competitors could purchase our product and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts, willfully infringe our intellectual property rights, design around our protected technology or develop their own competitive technologies and thereby avoid infringing our intellectual property rights. If our intellectual property is not sufficient to\neffectively prevent our competitors from developing and selling similar diagnostic tests, our competitive position and our business could be adversely affected.\nOur platform depends on certain technologies that are licensed to us. We do not control these technologies and any loss of our rights to them could prevent us from manufacturing our assays.\nWe rely on licenses to various proprietary technologies that are material to our business, including the development of certain future assays. We have entered into non-exclusive licenses with Biohelix Corp., or Biohelix, a subsidiary of Quidel Corporation and a license with Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. that has certain exclusive and non-exclusive fields. Our rights to use these technologies will be subject to the continuation of and our compliance with the terms of those licenses.\nWe may become involved in disputes relating to our intellectual property rights, and may need to resort to litigation in order to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights.\nExtensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights has been common in the medical diagnostic testing industry. Litigation may be necessary to assert infringement claims, protect trade secrets or know-how and determine the enforceability, scope and validity of certain proprietary rights. Litigation may even be necessary to resolve disputes of inventorship or ownership of proprietary rights. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property lawsuits, USPTO interference or derivation proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings (e.g., a re-examination) in the United States and internationally involve complex legal and factual questions. As a result, such proceedings are costly and time consuming to pursue, and their outcome is uncertain.\nEven if we prevail in such a proceeding in which we assert our intellectual property rights against third parties, the remedy we obtain may not be commercially meaningful or adequately compensate us for any damages we may have suffered. If we do not prevail in such a proceeding, our patents could potentially be declared to be invalid, unenforceable or narrowed in scope, or we could otherwise lose valuable intellectual property rights. Similar proceedings involving the intellectual property we exclusively license could also have an impact on our business. Further, if any of our other owned or exclusively licensed patents are declared invalid, unenforceable or narrowed in scope, our competitive position could be adversely affected.\nWe could face claims that our activities or the manufacture, use or sale of our assays infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which could cause us to pay damages or licensing fees and limit our ability to sell some or all of our assays and services.\nOur research, development and commercialization activities may infringe or be claimed to infringe patents or other intellectual property rights owned by other parties of which we may be unaware because the relevant patent applications may have been filed but not yet published. Certain of our competitors and other companies have substantial patent portfolios, and may attempt to use patent litigation as a means to obtain a competitive advantage or to extract licensing revenue. In addition to patent infringement claims, we may also be subject to other claims relating to the violation of intellectual property rights, such as claims that we have misappropriated trade secrets or infringed third party trademarks. The risks of being involved in such litigation may also increase as we gain greater visibility as a public company and as we gain commercial acceptance of our diagnostic tests and move into new markets and applications for our assays.\nRegardless of merit or outcome, our involvement in any litigation, interference or other administrative proceedings could cause us to incur substantial expense and could significantly divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. Any public announcements related to litigation or interference proceedings initiated or threatened against us could cause our share price to decline. An adverse determination, or any actions we take or agreements we enter into in order to resolve or avoid disputes, may subject us to the loss of our proprietary position or to significant liabilities, or require us to seek licenses that may include substantial cost and ongoing royalties. Licenses may not be available from third parties, or may not be obtainable on satisfactory terms. An adverse determination or a failure to obtain necessary licenses may restrict or prevent us from manufacturing and selling our diagnostic tests and offering our services. These outcomes could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property outside of the United States.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to medical devices, diagnostic testing and biotechnology, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents and for licensors, if they were to seek to do so, to stop infringement of patents that are licensed to us. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Additionally, prosecuting and maintaining intellectual property (particularly patent) rights are very costly endeavors, and for these and other reasons we may not pursue or obtain patent protection in all major markets. We do not know whether legal and government fees will increase substantially and therefore are unable to predict whether cost may factor into our global intellectual property strategy.\nIn addition to the risks associated with patent rights, the laws in some foreign jurisdictions may not provide protection for our trade secrets and other intellectual property. If our trade secrets or other intellectual property are misappropriated in foreign jurisdictions, we may be without adequate remedies to address these issues. Additionally, we also rely on confidentiality and assignment of invention agreements to protect our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions. These agreements may provide for contractual remedies in the event of misappropriation, but we do not know to what extent, if any, these agreements, and any remedies for their breach, will be enforced by a foreign court. If our intellectual property is misappropriated or infringed upon and an adequate remedy is not available, our future prospects will likely diminish. The sale of diagnostic tests that infringe our intellectual property rights, particularly if such diagnostic tests are offered at a lower cost, could negatively impact our ability to achieve commercial success and may materially and adversely harm our business.\nOur failure to secure trademark registrations could adversely affect our business and our ability to market our assays and product candidates.\nOur trademark applications in the United States and any other jurisdictions where we may file may not be allowed for registration, and our registered trademarks may not be maintained or enforced. During trademark registration proceedings, we may receive rejections. Although we are given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may be unable to overcome such rejections. In addition, in the USPTO and in corresponding foreign agencies, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our applications and/or registrations, and our applications and/or registrations may not survive such proceedings. Failure to secure such trademark registrations in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect our business and our ability to market our diagnostic tests and product candidates.\nWe may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information, or the misappropriation of the intellectual property we regard as our own.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary know how and technological advances, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. Nevertheless, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, third party contractors, third party collaborators and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements generally require that the other party to the agreement keep confidential and not disclose to third parties all confidential information developed by us or made known to the other party by us during the course of the other party\u2019s relationship with us. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Monitoring unauthorized disclosure is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to prevent such disclosure are, or will be, adequate. If we were to seek to pursue a claim that a third party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets, it would be expensive and time consuming, and the outcome would be\nunpredictable. Further, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information and therefore be free to use such trade secrets and proprietary information. Costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. In addition, our trade secrets and proprietary information may be misappropriated as a result of breaches of our electronic or physical security systems in which case we may have no legal recourse. Failure to obtain, or maintain, trade secret protection could enable competitors to use our proprietary information to develop assays that compete with our assays or cause additional, material adverse effects upon our competitive business position.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is common in our industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other companies in our industry or in related industries, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may be subject to claims that we or these employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.", "PERMNO": 15010, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "GBSNQ"}
