{"cik": "1626199", "company": "Nivalis Therapeutics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS\nOur business faces significant risks and uncertainties. Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations, and you should carefully consider them. Accordingly, in evaluating our business, we encourage you to consider the following discussion of risk factors, in its entirety, in addition to other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other public filings with the SEC. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Evaluation of Strategic Alternatives and Our Business\nOur exploration and pursuit of strategic alternatives may not be successful.\nFollowing the failure of cavosonstat to achieve the primary endpoint in a Phase 2 trial of patients with CF, we determined to cease all further development of cavosonstat and our other product candidates and implemented operating cost reductions and organizational restructurings, including a recent reduction in our workforce, to preserve our cash resources and better align our organization with our current operating plan. Our strategic focus has shifted to the identification and evaluation of a range of potential strategic alternatives designed to maximize stockholder value. Potential strategic alternatives that may be explored or evaluated as part of this process include the potential for an acquisition, merger, business combination, licensing and/or other strategic transaction involving the Company. Despite devoting significant efforts to identify and evaluate potential strategic transactions, the process may not result in any definitive offer to consummate a strategic transaction, or, if we receive such a definitive offer, the terms may not be as favorable as anticipated or may not result in the execution or approval of a definitive agreement. Even if we enter into a definitive agreement, we may not be successful in completing a transaction or, if we complete such a transaction, it may not enhance stockholder value or deliver expected benefits.\nIf we do not successfully consummate a strategic transaction, our board of directors may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation of our company. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such liquidation as well as the amount of cash that will need to be reserved for commitments and contingent liabilities.\nThere can be no assurance that the process to identify a strategic transaction will result in a successfully consummated transaction. If no transaction is completed, our board of directors may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation of our company. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such decision and, ultimately, such liquidation, since the amount of cash available for distribution continues to decrease as we fund our operations while we evaluate our strategic alternatives. In addition, if our board of directors were to approve and recommend, and our stockholders were to approve, a dissolution and liquidation of our company, we would be required under Delaware corporate law to pay our outstanding obligations, as well as to make reasonable provision for contingent and unknown obligations, prior to making any distributions in liquidation to our stockholders. Our commitments and contingent liabilities may include (i) regulatory and clinical obligations remaining under our Phase 2 trial for cavosonstat; (ii) obligations under our employment and related agreements with certain employees that provide for severance and other payments following a termination of employment occurring for various reasons, including a change in control of our company; and (iii) potential investigations or litigation against us, and other various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. As a result of this requirement, a portion of our assets may need to be reserved pending the resolution of such obligations. In addition, we may be subject to litigation or other claims related to a dissolution and liquidation of our company. If a dissolution and liquidation were pursued, our board of directors, in consultation with its advisors, would need to evaluate these matters and make a determination about a reasonable amount to reserve. Accordingly, holders of our common stock could lose all or a significant portion of their investment in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company.\nIf we are successful in completing a strategic transaction, we may be exposed to other operational and financial risks.\nAlthough there can be no assurance that a strategic transaction will result from the process we have undertaken to identify and evaluate strategic alternatives, the negotiation and consummation of any such transaction will require significant time on the part of our management, and the diversion of management\u2019s attention may disrupt our business.\nThe negotiation and consummation of any such transaction may also require more time or greater cash resources than we anticipate and expose us to other operational and financial risks, including:\n\u00b7\nincreased near-term and long-term expenditures;\n\u00b7\nexposure to unknown liabilities;\n\u00b7\nhigher than expected acquisition or integration costs;\n\u00b7\nincurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities to fund future operations;\n\u00b7\nwrite-downs of assets or goodwill or incurrence of non-recurring, impairment or other charges;\n\u00b7\nincreased amortization expenses;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired business with our operations and personnel;\n\u00b7\nimpairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired business due to changes in management and ownership; and\n\u00b7\ninability to retain key employees of our company or any acquired business.\nAny of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may not realize any additional value in a strategic transaction for our portfolio of GSNOR inhibitors.\nThe market capitalization of our company is significantly below the value of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Although our most advanced product candidate, cavosonstat, failed to meet its primary endpoint and a key secondary endpoint in CF, we believe that data from preclinical studies of cavosonstat and the other GSNOR inhibitors in our portfolio support potential further investigation of these candidates in other therapeutic indications, which may include inflammatory lung and bowel diseases, and certain cardiovascular diseases. Potential counterparties in a strategic transaction involving our company may place minimal or no value on these assets, however, given the limited data regarding their potential application in these diseases. Further, the development and any potential commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund the costs associated with conducting the necessary preclinical and clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval. Consequently, any potential counterparty in a strategic transaction involving our company may choose not to spend additional resources and continue development of our product candidates and may attribute little or no value, in such a transaction, to those product candidates.\nWe may become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management\u2019s attention and harm the company\u2019s business, and insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all costs and damages.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often followed certain significant business transactions, such as the sale of a company or announcement of any other strategic transaction, or the announcement of negative events, such as negative results from clinical trials. These events may also result in investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We may be exposed to such litigation or investigation even if no wrongdoing occurred. Litigation and investigations are usually expensive and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business and cash resources and our ability to consummate a potential strategic transaction or the ultimate value our stockholders receive in any such transaction.\nWe may experience difficulties, delays or unexpected costs and not achieve anticipated benefits and savings from our recently announced corporate restructuring plans, and our restructuring activities may adversely affect our ability to consummate a strategic transaction that enhances stockholder value.\nFollowing the failure of our Phase 2 trial of cavosonstat to meet its primary endpoint in patients with CF in November 2016, we implemented a plan in January 2017 to reduce our workforce by approximately 84%, leaving approximately five employees remaining after March 31, 2017 in order to better align our resources with our operational needs going forward. As part of this corporate restructuring and our focus on the identification and evaluation of strategic alternatives, we also discontinued all of our research activities and focused on the completion and close-out of\nany ongoing clinical trial activities. These reductions in force resulted in or will result in the loss of numerous long-term employees, the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, and the reallocation of certain job responsibilities, all of which could negatively affect operational efficiencies and increase our operating expenses such that we may not fully realize anticipated savings from the restructuring, and could significantly impair our ability to successfully complete a potential strategic transaction on terms that are favorable to our stockholders, or at all.\nWe are substantially dependent on our remaining employees to facilitate the consummation of a strategic transaction.\nOur ability to successfully complete a strategic transaction depends in large part on our ability to retain certain of our remaining personnel, particularly R. Michael Carruthers, our Interim President and Chief Financial Officer, and Janice Troha, our Chief Operating Officer. Despite our efforts to retain these employees, one or more may terminate their employment with us on short notice. The loss of the services of any of these employees could potentially harm our ability to evaluate and pursue strategic alternatives, as well as fulfill our reporting obligations as a public company.\nRisks Associated with Our Limited Operating History, Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred significant net losses in each year since our inception, including net losses of $31.5 million, $22.8 million, and $15.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $180.3 million. We expect to continue to incur operating expenses and anticipate that we will continue to have losses in the foreseeable future as we evaluate and potentially act on strategic alternatives. Moreover, even if our Board of Directors determines to pursue a specific strategic alternative, we expect that significant expenses will be involved in completing any resulting transaction or transactions, which will further reduce our existing capital.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nour ability to identify and successfully consummate a strategic transaction involving our company;\n\u00b7\nthe timing, complexity and costs required for completion of any transaction that may result from our review of strategic alternatives;\n\u00b7\nthe timing and resources required for completion and close-out of our cavosonstat clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe costs associated with archiving company records related to our research and development, and general and administrative activities;\n\u00b7\nthe costs of storing drug substance and drug product in compliance with cGMP requirements;\n\u00b7\nthe costs of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing, and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n\u00b7\nthe extent to which we may elect to resume drug research and development activities in the future, if at all; and\n\u00b7\ncosts that may be incurred in responding to disruptive actions by activist stockholders.\nOur losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital. Further, because of uncertainties relating to the outcome of the process we have undertaken to identify and evaluate strategic alternatives and the risks and uncertainties inherent in the biotechnology industry, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or whether we will become profitable.\nOur recurring losses from operations may raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have had recurring losses from operations since inception and will likely not generate revenue for the foreseeable future. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and interest thereon will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements under our current operating plan. However, if our operating\nplans change and our projected operating requirements increase, we may be unable to continue as a going concern. In this event, the perception that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may have an adverse impact on our business due to concerns about our ability to meet our contractual obligations. Further, if we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets, and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation and dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements and an investor could lose all or part of their investment in our company.\nAlthough we have ceased all further development of cavosonstat and our other potential product candidates, if we were to resume research and development activities, we would require substantial additional funding. Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or to a product candidate.\nWe currently do not have any committed external source of funds and do not expect to generate any revenue in the foreseeable future. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and interest thereon will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements under our current operating plan. We have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect if our operating plans change. If our current operating plans change and we determine to pursue further research and development activities, we will require substantial additional funding to operate, and would expect to finance these cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government or other third-party funding and licensing or collaboration arrangements.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt, the ownership interests of our stockholders will be diluted. In addition, the terms of any equity or convertible debt we agree to issue may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Convertible debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, and declaring dividends, and may impose limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.\nAdditional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to curtail or cease our operations or we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nOur inability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards before they expire may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2016 we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $75.7 million and $83.0 million, respectively, which may be utilized against future federal and state income taxes. In general, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders, generally stockholders beneficially owning five percent or more of our common stock, applying certain look-through and aggregation rules, increases by more than 50% over such stockholders\u2019 lowest percentage ownership during the testing period, generally three years. Purchases of our common stock in amounts greater than specified levels, which will be beyond our control, could create a limitation on our ability to utilize our NOLs for tax purposes in the future. In addition, the closing of a strategic transaction may result in the limitation of our NOLs, which may affect the value we receive in such a strategic transaction. Limitations imposed on our ability to utilize NOLs could cause us to pay U.S. federal and state income taxes earlier than we would otherwise be required if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such NOLs to expire unused. Furthermore, we may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our NOLs before they expire beginning in 2032. In addition, at the state level there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which would accelerate or may permanently increase state taxes owed. If any of these events occur, we may not derive some or all of the expected benefits from our NOLs, and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected as a result. As of December 31, 2016, we have not performed a formal study to determine whether limitations to our NOLs have occurred or whether such limitations could result from the sale of shares in our initial public offering in June 2015. Such limitations could be significant.\nRisks Relating to Development and Regulatory Approval\nCavosonstat did not achieve its primary endpoint in a Phase 2 trial with CF patients, and our previous findings from preclinical studies in other potential disease areas may not be predictive of a benefit for cavosonstat or any other of our GSNOR inhibitors.\nWe have ceased all research and development activities for cavosonstat and all of our GSNOR inhibitors and we currently have no plans to pursue such development ourselves as we identify and evaluate potential strategic alternatives for the company. If our operating plans change, however, and we are successful in completing a transaction following which further development of cavosonstat or our other GSNOR inhibitors is resumed, these development activities may not result in drugs that are approved by regulatory authorities. Regulatory agencies, including the FDA, ultimately must approve any product candidate before it can be promoted, marketed or commercially distributed. Cavosonstat and any other potential product candidate we may develop will be subject to extensive and rigorous review and regulation by governmental authorities. We have never obtained approval for or commercialized a product candidate, and our portfolio of GSNOR inhibitors outside of CF is at an early stage of development and unproven. The timing of the drug development process is lengthy and can be unpredictable and may include post-marketing studies and surveillance. Any such development of our GSNOR inhibitors would require the expenditure of additional resources beyond our existing cash, cash equivalents or marketable securities. Of the large number of drugs in development for approval in the United States, only a small percentage successfully complete the regulatory approval process and are commercialized. The success of any of our potential product candidates depends on, among other things:\n\u00b7\nour ability to complete clinical trials and other product research and development activities;\n\u00b7\nwhether clinical trials demonstrate statistically significant and clinically meaningful efficacy not outweighed by safety issues;\n\u00b7\nmeeting FDA and other regulatory agencies\u2019 requirements to obtain approval for a product candidate; and\n\u00b7\nensuring that the manufacturing processes and facilities of the third parties with which we contract to manufacture a product candidate are in compliance with all relevant regulatory requirements, including those of the FDA.\nIf we are not successful with respect to one or more of these factors either in a timely manner or at all, significant delays in obtaining regulatory approval, including, but not limited to, denial of a new drug application, or NDA, could result. We have never applied for, and have never received, regulatory approval for a drug. If we are unable to successfully complete the clinical development of a product candidate and meet other related regulatory requirements, we will be unable to obtain approval of an NDA from the FDA. It is possible that, even if we successfully complete clinical development, the FDA may refuse to accept our NDA for substantive review or may conclude after review of our data that our application is insufficient. If the FDA does not accept or approve our NDA, it may require that we conduct additional clinical, nonclinical or manufacturing studies or analyses and submit that data to it before it will reconsider our application. Depending on the extent of these or any other FDA requirements, approval of any NDA or application that we submit may be delayed by several years, or may require us to expend more resources than we have available. It is also possible that additional studies, if performed and completed, may not be considered sufficient by the FDA to approve our NDA.\nIn addition, the regulatory agencies may not complete their review processes in a timely manner, or additional delays may result if a potential drug candidate is brought before an FDA advisory committee, which could recommend restrictions on approval or recommend non-approval of the product candidate. In addition, delays or rejections could result based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action, or changes in regulatory agency policy during the period of product development, clinical studies and the review process. As a result, we cannot predict when, if at all, we will receive regulatory approval of any product candidate.\nAny delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing a product candidate, generating revenue and achieving and sustaining profitability. If any of these outcomes occur, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and could potentially cause us to cease operations. These factors could materially harm our business, and the value of our common stock would likely decline.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time-consuming and inherently unpredictable.\nWe are not permitted to market any of our potential product candidates in the United States or outside the United States until we receive approval of an NDA from the FDA or approval of a marketing application from the comparable regulatory authority in other countries. Should we determine to resume development of any of our GSNOR inhibitors, prior to submitting an NDA to the FDA for approval, we will need to complete our preclinical studies in the applicable indication, as well as all necessary clinical trials. Successfully initiating and completing clinical programs and obtaining approval of an NDA is a complex, lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may delay, limit or deny approval of a potential product candidate for many reasons, including, among others:\n\u00b7\nthe results of our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistically significant and clinically meaningful efficacy with an acceptable safety profile as required by FDA, or other comparable regulatory authorities in other countries, for marketing approval;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA or other comparable regulatory authorities in other countries may disagree with the number, design, size, conduct or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA or other comparable regulatory authorities may find the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials insufficient to demonstrate that the potential clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA or other comparable regulatory authorities in other countries may disagree with our interpretation of data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA or other comparable regulatory authorities in other countries may not accept data generated at one or more of our clinical trial sites;\n\u00b7\nif our NDAs or similar applications, if and when submitted, are reviewed by FDA or other comparable regulatory authorities, as applicable, the regulatory authorities may have difficulties scheduling the necessary review meetings in a timely manner, may recommend against approval of our application or may recommend that the FDA or other comparable regulatory authorities, as applicable, require, as a condition of approval, additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, limitations on approved labeling or distribution and restrictions on use;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA may determine that our NDAs, if and when submitted, must follow a different regulatory pathway than we have attempted, and there may be potentially extended standards, timelines, and/or costs in order to pursue approval;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA may require development of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy as a condition of approval or post-approval, and other comparable regulatory authorities may grant only conditional approval or impose specific obligations as a condition for marketing authorization, or may require us to conduct post-authorization safety studies;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA or other comparable regulatory authorities may determine that the manufacturing processes or facilities of third party manufacturers with which we contract are not in compliance with all relevant regulatory requirements, including current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements; or\n\u00b7\nthe FDA or other comparable regulatory authorities may change their approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nAny of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, could jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and successfully market any of our potential product candidates, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nIf we were to resume research and development activities on our potential product candidates, we would depend on the successful completion of clinical trials for any potential product candidate. The positive clinical results, if any, obtained by us in future clinical trials may not be repeated in later-stage clinical trials.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of a potential product candidate, extensive clinical trials are required to demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans. We have not completed the clinical trials necessary to support an application for approval to market cavosonstat or any other potential product candidate. Successful completion of such clinical trials is a prerequisite to submitting an NDA to the FDA and, consequently, the ultimate approval and commercial marketing of any of our potential product candidates. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. Further, the outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later preclinical testing or clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. For example, despite positive preclinical and early stage clinical results, cavosonstat did not achieve the primary endpoint in a recently completed Phase 2 clinical trial in CF that was announced in November 2016. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval for their products.\nShould we choose to resume development of any of our potential candidates, we may experience a number of unforeseen events during, or as a result of, any future clinical trials of that may be conducted on any of our potential product candidates that could adversely affect the completion of those clinical trials, including:\n\u00b7\nregulators, and/or institutional review boards or other reviewing bodies may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial, or to conduct or continue a clinical trial at a prospective or specific trial site;\n\u00b7\nclinical trials of a potential product candidate may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u00b7\nthe number of subjects required for clinical trials of a potential product candidate may be larger than anticipated, enrollment in these clinical trials may be insufficient or slower than anticipated or subjects may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than anticipated;\n\u00b7\nthird party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u00b7\nclinical trials of a potential product candidate may be suspended or terminated for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u00b7\nregulators, institutional review boards or data monitoring committees may require or recommend that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including safety signals or noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of clinical trials of a potential product candidate may be greater than anticipated;\n\u00b7\nthe supply or quality of a potential product candidate or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of a product candidate may be insufficient or inadequate; and\n\u00b7\na potential product candidate may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics.\nNegative or inconclusive results of any future clinical trials of our potential product candidates could mandate repeated or additional clinical studies. Despite the safety results reported in earlier clinical trials for cavosonstat, we do not know whether any other clinical trials we may conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety to result in regulatory approval to market cavosonstat in any other indications or any other potential product candidate. If later stage clinical trials do not produce favorable results, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for a potential product candidate may be adversely impacted.\nShould we resume research and development activities, delays in clinical trials are common and have many causes, and any delay could have a material adverse effect on our business, such as increased costs and delays in our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commence product sales. In this event, we may be required to suspend, repeat or terminate our clinical trials if they are not conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, the results are negative or inconclusive or the trials are not well designed.\nClinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations or other applicable foreign government regulations, and are subject to oversight by the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities and institutional review boards at the medical institutions where the clinical trials are conducted. In addition, clinical trials must be conducted with product candidates produced under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and may require large numbers of test subjects.\nIf we resume research and development activities relating to our GSNOR inhibitors, we may experience delays in clinical trials at any stage of development and testing of any such potential product candidate.\nEvents which may result in a delay or unsuccessful completion of clinical trials for any of our GSNOR inhibitors include:\n\u00b7\ninability to secure a collaborative partner to undertake future development of any of our GSNOR inhibitors raise funding necessary to initiate or continue a trial;\n\u00b7\ndelays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u00b7\ndelays in reaching agreement with FDA or regulatory authorities in other countries on final trial design;\n\u00b7\nimposition of a clinical hold based on the submission of results of clinical and preclinical studies or following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\ndelays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites;\n\u00b7\ndelays in obtaining required institutional review board approval at each site;\n\u00b7\ndelays in recruiting and retaining suitable subjects to participate in a trial;\n\u00b7\ndelays in having subjects complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u00b7\ndelays caused by subjects dropping out of a trial due to side effects or otherwise;\n\u00b7\nclinical sites dropping out of a trial to the detriment of enrollment;\n\u00b7\nstudy personnel may administer the wrong version of a potential product candidate or assign study therapy to the wrong treatment group, resulting in disqualification of subjects from data analysis;\n\u00b7\nstudy personnel may not perform in accordance with good clinical practices;\n\u00b7\na potential product candidate may have unforeseen adverse side effects;\n\u00b7\ntime required to add new clinical sites; and\n\u00b7\ndelays by our contract manufacturers to produce and deliver sufficient supply of clinical trial materials.\nIf initiation or completion of any of our clinical trials are delayed for any of the above reasons, our development may be arrested, development costs may increase, our approval process could be delayed, any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize a potential product candidate may be reduced and our competitors may have more time to bring products to market before we do or otherwise delay us. Any of these events could impair our ability to generate revenue from product sales and impair our ability to generate regulatory and commercialization milestones and royalties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur potential product candidates may cause adverse events or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the scope of any approved label or market acceptance.\nIf we were to resume research and development activities relating to our GSNOR inhibitors, undesirable adverse events caused by our potential product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay, halt or terminate clinical trials and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications. It is possible that during the course of the clinical development of a potential product candidate, results of our clinical trials could reveal an unacceptable severity and prevalence of adverse events. In addition, our remaining preclinical testing may produce inconclusive or negative safety results, which may require us to conduct additional preclinical testing or to abandon a potential product candidate. Also, a potential product candidate may have unfavorable pharmacology or toxicity characteristics, or cause undesirable side effects.\nUndesirable adverse events caused by a potential product candidate could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete a clinical trial or result in potential product liability claims. In addition, adverse events that occur in our trials as a consequence of the serious disease that is being studied may negatively affect the profile of the potential product candidate. The FDA or other regulatory authorities may determine that additional safety testing is required for a potential product candidate, which would cause a delay in our clinical development of such product candidate.\nAdditionally, if any potential product candidate receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable adverse events caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may withdraw approval of the potential product candidate or impose restrictions on their distribution in the form of a modified risk evaluation and mitigation strategy;\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may require additional labeling, such as warnings or contraindications;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to change the way the product is administered or to conduct additional clinical studies;\n\u00b7\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u00b7\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects. Any such events would increase our costs and could delay or prevent our ability to commercialize our product candidates should we resume development activities, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCavosonstat and any other potential product candidate based on our GSNOR inhibitor portfolio are based on a novel technology, which may raise development issues we may not anticipate or be able to resolve, and regulatory issues that could delay or prevent approval.\nCavosonstat and any other potential product candidate based on our GSNOR inhibitor technology platform are based on a novel technology, and there can be no assurance that unforeseen development problems related to our novel technology will not arise in the future and cause significant delays should we determine to resume research and development activities relating to our GSNOR inhibitors. We may be unable to resolve any such unforeseen problems.\nRegulatory approval of novel product candidates can be more expensive and take longer than other, more well-known or extensively studied pharmaceutical product candidates due to our and regulatory agencies\u2019 lack of experience with them. There are no GSNOR inhibitors that we know of in clinical development and none have been approved to date. Should we resume research and development activities relating to our GSNOR inhibitors, the novelty of our platform may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to conduct additional studies or clinical trials, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of cavosonstat or any other potential product candidate based on our GSNOR inhibitor technology platform or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. For example, the FDA could require additional studies or characterization that may be difficult or impossible to perform.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for a potential product candidate, we will still face extensive ongoing regulatory requirements.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval in the United States, the FDA may still impose significant future restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of a potential product candidate, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance, including Phase 4 clinical trials. Should we obtain regulatory approval, we will be subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing the labeling, manufacturing, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, record-keeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information. The holder of an approved NDA is obligated to monitor and report adverse events and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA. The holder of an approved NDA must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules and are subject to FDA review, in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws.\nIn addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to payment of user fees and continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMPs, and adherence to commitments made in the NDA. If we, or a regulatory agency, discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as quality issues or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions relative to that product or the manufacturing facility, including necessitating recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable ongoing regulatory requirements following approval of a product candidate, a regulatory agency may:\n\u00b7\nissue an untitled or warning letter asserting that we are in violation of the law;\n\u00b7\nseek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u00b7\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u00b7\nsuspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nrefuse to approve a pending NDA or supplements to an NDA submitted by us; or\n\u00b7\ndemand recall and/or seize product.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit the commercialization of any potential product candidate and inhibit our ability to generate revenue.\nThe approval of a potential product candidate in any given market does not ensure approval in any other market.\nIn order to market any product candidate, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements on a country-by-country basis regarding safety and efficacy. Approval in the United States by the FDA or by a regulatory agency in another country does not ensure approval by the regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or ensure approval for the same conditions of use. In addition, clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not guarantee regulatory approval in any other country. Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs for us and require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials which could be costly and time-consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our product candidates in those countries. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale in any jurisdiction, including international markets, and we do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approval in international markets. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, or if regulatory approvals in international markets are delayed, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates will be unrealized.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nIf we attempt to form strategic alliances or collaborations in the future with third parties for the development and commercialization of any of our product candidates, we may not be successful in establishing these alliances or collaborations.\nWe may seek to form strategic alliances or collaborations for the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. We may not be successful in entering into any such transaction on favorable terms or at all. Our potential product candidates may be considered to be too early in development for a collaborative effort or may be perceived as being too risky or without sufficient market potential or otherwise as insufficient for clinical, market or other reasons. If we were successful in entering into a strategic alliance or collaboration, our ability to generate revenue from the alliance or collaboration will depend on our collaborators\u2019 abilities to establish the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, to obtain regulatory approvals and to achieve market acceptance. Strategic alliances and collaborations involving our product candidates pose many risks to us, including:\n\u00b7\nstrategic alliances and collaborations may not lead to development of product candidates or commercialization of products in the most efficient manner or at all;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators have significant discretion in determining the amount and timing of efforts and resources that they will apply to these alliances\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may interpret clinical trial or non-clinical study results differently than we do, may pursue further development and commercialization of our product candidates for indications that we do not believe are optimal, may not pursue further development and commercialization of our product candidates at all or may elect not to continue or renew research and development programs based on nonclinical or clinical trial results, changes in their strategic focus or available funding, or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit enough resources to their marketing and distribution;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u00b7\ndisputes may arise between us and collaborators that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates, that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources or that, if resolved unfavorably to us, result in adverse financial consequences for us under the terms of the applicable agreements; and\n\u00b7\nstrategic alliances and collaborations may be terminated, either in their entirety or as to particular product candidates or programs, which may result in a need for a reallocation of internal funds or additional capital to pursue further development of the applicable product candidates.\nOur employees, consultants or CROs may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, consultants and other third parties, such as principal investigators, CROs and vendors, if any. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless or negligent conduct, and/or failures to comply with FDA regulations, provide accurate information to the FDA, comply\nwith manufacturing standards we have established, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Misconduct by these parties could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nRisks Relating to Protecting Our Intellectual Property\nIt is difficult and expensive to protect our intellectual property rights and we cannot ensure that they will prevent third parties from competing against us.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property rights, both in the United States and other countries, successfully defend this intellectual property against third party challenges and successfully enforce this intellectual property to prevent third party infringement. We rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements.\nOur ability to protect any of our product candidates and technologies from unauthorized or infringing use by third parties depends in substantial part on our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents in both the United States and other countries. Patent matters in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Changes in either the patent laws, implementing regulations or in interpretations of patent laws may diminish the value of our patent rights.\nThere can be no assurance that we will discover or develop patentable products or processes or that patents will issue from any pending patent applications owned or licensed by us or any patent applications we may own or license in the future, or if issued, that the breadth of such patent coverage will be sufficient. We cannot guarantee that claims of issued patents owned or licensed to us, either now or in the future, are or will be held valid or enforceable by the courts or, even if unchallenged, will provide us with exclusivity or commercial value for our product candidates or technology or any significant protection against competitive products or prevent others from designing around our claims. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market our product candidates under patent protection could be reduced. Our patent rights also depend on our compliance with technology and patent licenses upon which our patent rights are based and upon the validity of assignments of patent rights from consultants and other inventors that were, or are, not employed by us.\nPatent applications are generally maintained in confidence until publication. In the United States, for example, patent applications are maintained in secrecy for up to 18 months after their filing. Similarly, publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lag behind actual discoveries. Consequently, we cannot be certain that we were the first to invent, or the first to file patent applications on our product candidates. There is also no assurance that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found, which could be used by a third party to challenge validity of our patents or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application.\nIn addition, even if patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge any patent we own or license through adversarial proceedings in the issuing offices, which could result in the invalidation or unenforceability of some or all of the relevant patent claims. If a third party asserts a substantial new question of patentability against any claim of a United States patent we own or license, the USPTO may grant a request for reexamination, which may result in a loss of scope of some claims or a loss of the entire patent. The adoption of the America Invents Act has established additional opportunities for third parties to invalidate United States patent claims, including inter partes review and post-grant review, on the basis of a lower legal standards than reexamination and additional grounds.\nWe will incur significant ongoing expenses in maintaining our patent portfolio. Should we lack the funds to maintain our patent portfolio or to enforce our rights against infringers, we could be adversely impacted. Even if claims of infringement are without merit, any such action could divert the time and attention of management and impair our ability to access additional capital and/or cost us significant funds to defend.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on all of our product candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may manufacture and sell our potential products in those foreign countries where we have not filed for patent protection or where patent protection may be unavailable, not obtainable or ultimately not enforceable. Our competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets and, further, may be able to export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.\nOur patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications in countries outside of the United States, including Europe, Canada, Japan and Australia. The scope of coverage provided by these patents varies from country to country. Moreover, the laws of some foreign jurisdictions do not provide intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the United States and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in obtaining such rights in foreign jurisdictions. Outside of the United States, patents we own or license may become subject to patent opposition in the European Patent Office or similar proceedings, which may result in loss of scope of some claims or loss of the entire patent. Participation in adversarial proceedings is very complex, expensive, and may divert our management\u2019s attention from our core business and may result in unfavorable outcomes that could adversely affect our ability to prevent third parties from competing with us.\nMany companies have also encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to pharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. For example, an April 2014 report from the Office of the United States Trade Representative identified a number of countries, including India and China, where challenges to the procurement and enforcement of patent rights have been reported. Several countries, including India and China, have been listed in the report every year since 1989. If we encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions, the value of our proprietary technology could be substantially harmed. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in certain foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u00b7\nOthers may be able to make compounds that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u00b7\nWe or our licensors or strategic collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u00b7\nWe or our licensors or strategic collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u00b7\nOthers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nIt is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n\u00b7\nIssued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n\u00b7\nOur competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u00b7\nWe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and\n\u00b7\nThe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nShould any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nRecent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nOn September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business, our current and pending patent portfolio and future intellectual property strategy. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, the European Patent Office, or EPO, and other foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign national or international patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of patent rights include, but are not limited to, failure to timely file national and regional stage patent applications based on our international patent application, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or our licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product candidates, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSome of our intellectual property is licensed to us by a third party. If we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreement under which we license intellectual property rights from that third party, or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensor, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe have a license under certain patents and/or know-how to develop and commercialize certain of our potential product candidates. Our existing license agreements impose, and we expect that any future license agreements will impose on us, various obligations. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license. If any of our licenses are terminated and we are not able to negotiate other agreements for use of the intellectual property protections underlying these product candidates, we would not be able to manufacture and market these potential products, which would adversely affect our business prospects and financial condition.\nThe patent protection and patent prosecution for some of our potential product candidates is dependent or may be dependent in the future on third parties.\nWhile we normally seek and gain the right to fully prosecute the patents relating to our potential product candidates, there may be times when platform technology patents or product-specific patents that relate to our potential\nproduct candidates are controlled by our licensors. In addition, our licensors and/or licensees may have back-up rights to prosecute patent applications in the event that we do not do so or choose not to do so, and our licensees may have the right to assume patent prosecution rights after certain milestones are reached. If any of our licensing partners fail to appropriately prosecute and maintain patent protection for patents covering any of our potential product candidates, our ability to develop and commercialize those potential product candidates may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products.\nWe may be subject to litigation alleging that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties or litigation or other adversarial proceedings seeking to invalidate our patents or other proprietary rights, and we may need to resort to litigation to protect or enforce our patents or other proprietary rights, all of which will be costly to defend or pursue and uncertain in its outcome and may prevent or delay any future development and commercialization efforts or otherwise affect our business.\nOur success also will depend, in part, on our refraining from infringing patents or otherwise violating intellectual property owned or controlled by others. Numerous patents and pending applications are owned by third parties in the fields in which we are or may develop product candidates, both in the United States and elsewhere. It is difficult for industry participants, including us, to identify all third party patent rights that may be relevant to any of our potential product candidates because patent searching is imperfect due to differences in terminology among patents, incomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the meaning of patent claims. Moreover, because some patent applications are maintained in secrecy until the patents publish, we cannot be certain that third parties have not filed patent applications that cover our potential product candidates and technologies. Pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, universities, research institutions and others may have filed patent applications or have received, or may obtain, issued patents in the United States or elsewhere relating to aspects of our technology, including our potential product candidates, processes for manufacture or methods of use, including combination therapy. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third party patents will require us to alter our potential product candidates or processes, obtain licenses, or cease certain activities.\nIf patents issued to third parties contain blocking, dominating or conflicting claims and such claims are ultimately determined to be valid, we may be required to obtain licenses to these patents or to develop or obtain alternative non-infringing technology and cease practicing those activities, including potentially manufacturing or selling any products deemed to infringe those patents. If any licenses are required, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such licenses on commercially favorable terms, if at all, and if these licenses are not obtained, we might be prevented from pursuing the development and commercialization of certain of our potential product candidates. Even if a license can be obtained on acceptable terms, the rights may be non-exclusive, which could give our competitors access to the same technology or intellectual property rights licensed to us. Our failure to obtain a license to any technology that we may require to commercialize our potential product candidates on favorable terms may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to, or threatened with, future litigation by third parties having patent or other intellectual property rights alleging that our technologies, including our potential product candidates, processes for manufacture or methods of use, including combination therapy, or other proprietary technologies infringe their intellectual property rights. Parties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our potential product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful infringement or other intellectual property claim against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, pay royalties or redesign our affected products, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. We cannot predict whether any such license would be available at all or whether it would be available on commercially reasonable terms. Parties making successful claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our potential product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that third party patents do not exist which might be enforced against our products or potential product candidates, resulting in either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation to third parties.\nLitigation, which could result in substantial costs to us (even if determined in our favor), may also be necessary to enforce any patents issued or licensed to us. The cost to us in initiating any litigation or other proceeding relating to\npatent or other proprietary rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and litigation would divert our management\u2019s attention. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could delay our research and development efforts and limit our ability to continue our operations.\nIf we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our potential product candidates or our technology, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States and in most European countries, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, for example, lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on one or more of our products or certain aspects of our platform technology. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business. Patents and other intellectual property rights also will not protect our technology if competitors design around our protected technology without legally infringing our patents or other intellectual property rights.\nIn addition, if a third party has filed patent applications in the United States prior to March 16, 2013 that claim technology also claimed by us, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention. Such proceedings can be lengthy, are costly to defend and involve complex questions of law and fact the outcomes of which are difficult to predict. Moreover, we may have to participate in adversarial proceedings in the USPTO or foreign patent offices. An adverse decision relating to our patent rights could require us to cease using such technology, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If initiated, adversarial proceedings could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us.\nIf we are not able to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information, the value of our technology and products could be significantly diminished.\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect technology, especially where patent protection is not believed to be appropriate or obtainable or where patents have not issued. We attempt to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, with confidentiality agreements and assignment of invention agreements with our employees and confidentiality agreements with our consultants and certain contractors. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. We may fail in certain circumstances to obtain the necessary confidentiality agreements, or their scope or term may not be sufficiently broad to protect our interests.\nIf our trade secrets or other intellectual property become known to our competitors, it could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To the extent that we or our consultants or research collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in work for us, disputes may also arise as to the rights to related or resulting know-how and inventions.\nWe may be subject to claims that we or our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our employees\u2019 or consultants\u2019 former employers or their clients. These claims may be costly to defend and if we do not successfully do so, we may be required to pay monetary damages and may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel.\nMany of our current or former employees were previously employed at universities or biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key research personnel or their work product could compromise our ability to commercialize, or prevent us from commercializing, our product candidates, which could severely harm our\nbusiness. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nRisks Relating to Our Business Operations and Industry\nFollowing our recent reduction in force, we will not have resources or the required expertise to develop any of our potential product candidates, which may impair their value.\nBecause of the specialized scientific nature of our business and the unique properties of our GSNOR inhibitor platform, our ability to develop and commercialize any of our potential product candidates is highly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and technical personnel, consultants and advisors. Our recent reduction in force resulted in the departure of Mr. Jon Congleton, our CEO, Dr. David Rodman, our CMO, and Dr. Sherif Gabriel, our VP of Research and Discovery. Additionally, the reduction in force resulted in, or soon will result in, the elimination of all of our research and development staff. The loss of their services will significantly delay or prevent any resumption of the research and development of our GSNOR inhibitors should we choose to resume those activities in the future.\nShould we need to recruit additional personnel in order to resume research and development activities, we will need to hire additional qualified scientific personnel to perform research and development, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical testing, government regulation, manufacturing, marketing and sales, which may strain our existing managerial, operational, regulatory compliance, financial and other resources. We also rely on consultants and advisors to assist in formulating our research and development strategy and adhering to complex regulatory requirements. We face competition for qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities and other research institutions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such individuals in the future, on acceptable terms, if at all. Additionally, our facilities are located in Colorado, which may make attracting and retaining qualified scientific and technical personnel from outside of Colorado difficult. The failure to attract and retain qualified personnel, consultants and advisors could delay or prevent our ability to commercialize any of our potential product candidates based on our GSNOR inhibitor portfolio, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our research and development activities resume, we are exposed to potential product liability or similar claims, and insurance against these claims may not be available to us at a reasonable rate in the future or at all.\nDrug development involves potential liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of human therapeutic products. Clinical trials involve the testing of product candidates on human subjects or volunteers under a research plan, and carry a risk of liability for personal injury or death to patients due to unforeseen adverse side effects, improper administration of the product candidate, or other factors. Many of these patients are already seriously ill and are therefore particularly vulnerable to further illness or death.\nWe currently carry clinical trial liability insurance in the amount of $10.0 million in the aggregate, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such insurance or that the amount of such insurance will be adequate to cover claims. We could be materially and adversely affected if we were required to pay damages or incur defense costs in connection with a claim outside the scope of indemnity or insurance coverage, if the indemnity is not performed or enforced in accordance with its terms, or if our liability exceeds the amount of applicable insurance. In addition, there can be no assurance that insurance will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all, or that if obtained, the insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover any potential claims or liabilities. Similar risks would exist upon the commercialization or marketing of any products by us or our collaborators.\nRegardless of their merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7\ndecreased demand for any products that may eventually be approved;\n\u00b7\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7\ncosts of litigation;\n\u00b7\ndistraction of management; and\n\u00b7\nsubstantial monetary awards to plaintiffs.\nShould any of these events occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe may become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management\u2019s attention and adversely affect our business and could subject us to significant liabilities.\nThe stock markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the common stock of pharmaceutical companies. These broad market fluctuations as well a broad range of other factors, including the realization of any of the risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report and the consummation of any transaction resulting from our review of various strategic alternatives, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally experience significant stock price volatility. We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation typically is expensive and diverts management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business. Any adverse determination in any such litigation or any amounts paid to settle any such actual or threatened litigation could require that we make significant payments.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price is likely to be volatile and an active, liquid and orderly trading market may not develop for our common stock. As a result, stockholders may not be able to resell shares at or above their purchase price.\nPrior to our initial public offering, which was completed in June 2015, there was no public market for shares of our common stock. Although our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Market, an active trading market for our common stock may not develop or, if it develops, may not be sustained. The lack of an active market may impair the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares at the time they wish to sell them or at a price that they consider reasonable, which may reduce the fair market value of their shares. Further, an inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling our common stock should we determine additional funding is required and may impair our ability to enter into strategic transaction.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially as a result of many factors, some of which are beyond our control. For example, shares of our common stock have traded as high as $20.43 and as low as $2.04 in the eighteen-month period following the effective date of our IPO. These fluctuations could cause an investor to lose all or part of the value of his, her or its investment in our common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following:\n\u00b7\nthe announcement of a strategic transaction, including the acquisition or our company or its assets;\n\u00b7\nthe development status of our potential product candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe results of preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nresults of operations that vary from those of our competitors and the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;\n\u00b7\nour announcement of significant contracts, acquisitions, or capital commitments;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by our competitors of competing products or other initiatives;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us;\n\u00b7\nregulatory and reimbursement developments in the United States and abroad;\n\u00b7\nlack of an active, liquid or orderly market in our common stock;\n\u00b7\nfuture sales of our common stock or of debt securities;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral domestic and international economic conditions unrelated to our performance.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance of individual companies. These broad market factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in significant liabilities and, regardless of the outcome, could result in substantial costs and the diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur common stock may be delisted from the NASDAQ Global Market if we are unable to maintain compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing standards.\nNASDAQ imposes, among other requirements, continued listing standards including minimum bid and public float requirements. The price of our common stock must trade at or above $1.00 to comply with NASDAQ's minimum bid requirement for continued listing on the NASDAQ. If our stock trades at bid prices of less than $1.00 for a period in excess of 30 consecutive business days, the NASDAQ could send a deficiency notice to us for not remaining in compliance with the minimum bid listing standards. Our common stock has never traded below $1.00. However, if the closing bid price of our common stock fails to meet NASDAQ's minimum closing bid price requirement, or if we otherwise fail to meet any other applicable requirements of the NASDAQ and we are unable to regain compliance, NASDAQ may make a determination to delist our common stock. Any delisting of our common stock could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and the market price of our common stock could decrease. Furthermore, if our common stock were delisted it could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations and/or result in the loss of confidence by investors, customers, suppliers and employees.\nOur principal stockholders will have a controlling influence over our business affairs and may make business decisions with which stockholders disagree and which may adversely affect the value of their investment.\nOur principal stockholders, which consist of entities affiliated with Deerfield Management Company, L.P., Wellington Management Company LLP, the Estate of Arnold H. Snider, III, and BVF Partners L.P., and certain of their affiliates, beneficially own or control, directly or indirectly, approximately 55% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, if some of these persons or entities act together, they will have the ability to exercise significant influence over matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors, amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the approval of any strategic transaction requiring the approval of our stockholders. These actions may be taken even if they are opposed by other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares, which could prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares. Some of these persons or entities who make up our principal stockholders may have interests different from other stockholders.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, of a substantial amount of our common shares could depress the trading price of our common stock.\nAs of February 13, 2017, we have 200,000,000 shares of common stock authorized and 15,656,251 shares of common stock outstanding. Of these shares, the 6,325,000 shares sold during our IPO are freely tradable and, without giving effect to the purchase of shares by entities affiliated with certain of our existing stockholders, approximately 5.6 million shares are freely tradable under Rule 144 under the Securities Act by non-affiliates, and approximately 3.7 million shares are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, subject to the volume, manner of sale, holding period and other limitations of Rule 144. In addition, we have registered on a registration statement on Form S-3 that has been declared effective, (i) the sale of up to $125,000,000 in the aggregate of an indeterminate number of shares of common stock and preferred stock, an indeterminate principal amount of debt securities and an indeterminate number of warrants and (ii) the resale of up to 3,732,412 shares of common stock that are freely tradable by selling stockholders pursuant to a base prospectus that forms a part. The registration statement also registers the offering, issuance and sale of common stock having up to a maximum aggregate offering price of $20,000,000 that we may issue and sell in an at-the-market offering under a sales agreement we entered into with Cowen and Company, LLC on July 5, 2016 pursuant to a sales agreement prospectus that forms a part of the registration statement. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $19.8 million in shares of common stock remain for sale under the sales agreement.\nIf we or our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our shares of common stock in the public market or if the market perceives that these sales could occur, the market price of shares of our common stock could decline. These sales may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate, or to use equity as consideration for future acquisitions.\nThe JOBS Act allows us to postpone the date by which we must comply with certain laws and regulations intended to protect investors and to reduce the amount of information we provide in our reports filed with the SEC. We cannot be certain if this reduced disclosure will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nThe JOBS Act is intended to reduce the regulatory burden on \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d As defined in the JOBS Act, we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and could remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until as late as December 31, 2020. For so long as we are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we will, among other things:\n\u00b7\nnot be required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley;\n\u00b7\nnot be required to hold a nonbinding advisory stockholder vote on executive compensation pursuant to Section 14A(a) of the Exchange Act;\n\u00b7\nnot be required to seek stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved pursuant to Section 14A(b) of the Exchange Act;\n\u00b7\nbe exempt from any rule adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplemental auditor discussion and analysis; and\n\u00b7\nbe subject to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements.\nWe have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of an extended transition period under the JOBS Act that permits an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. As a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other companies.\nFurthermore, if we take advantage of some or all of the reduced disclosure requirements above, investors may find our common stock less attractive, which may result in a less active trading market for our common stock and greater stock price volatility.\nWe first became subject to rules and regulations established by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, regarding our internal control over financial reporting in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. If our internal controls are not determined to be effective, it may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the market price of our common stock and a stockholder\u2019s investment in our stock.\nAs a public reporting company, we are subject to the rules and regulations established from time to time by the SEC and the PCAOB. These rules and regulations require, among other things, that we establish and periodically evaluate procedures with respect to our internal controls over financial reporting. Reporting obligations as a public company place a considerable strain on our financial and management systems, processes and controls, as well as on our personnel, particularly following our reduction in force, which will result in approximately five employees remaining with the company after March 31, 2017.\nIn addition, as a public company we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley so that our management can certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Maintaining and monitoring these internal controls may be more difficult with fewer resources available to perform the necessary documentation and testing, and our internal controls may be found to be deficient. Likewise, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at such time as we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, although, as described in the preceding risk factor, we could potentially qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until December 31, 2020. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating.\nIf our senior management is unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, or to certify the effectiveness of such controls, or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an unqualified opinion on management\u2019s assessment and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our stock price. In addition, if we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, we may not be able to manage our business effectively or accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis, which could cause a decline in our common stock price and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures as well as internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are and will be met. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our remaining management team will be required to devote substantial time to compliance efforts.\nWe will continue to incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses as a result of being a public company. The Dodd-Frank Act and Sarbanes-Oxley as well as related rules implemented by the SEC and The NASDAQ Global Market, have imposed corporate governance requirements on public companies. In addition, rules that the SEC is implementing or is required to implement pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act are expected to require additional changes. We expect that compliance with these and other similar laws, rules and regulations, including compliance with Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, will substantially increase our expenses, including our legal and accounting costs, and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. Although the JOBS Act may for a limited period of time somewhat lessen the cost of complying with these additional regulatory and other requirements, we nonetheless expect to incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and certain other expenses in the future, which will negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur corporate documents and the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, contain provisions that may enable our Board of Directors to resist a change in control of our company even if a change in control were to be considered favorable by our stockholders. These provisions:\n\u00b7\nstagger the terms of our Board of Directors and require 662/3% stockholder voting to remove directors, who may only be removed for cause;\n\u00b7\nauthorize our Board of Directors to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of those shares, which may be senior to our common stock, without prior stockholder approval;\n\u00b7\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominating directors and proposing matters to be voted on by stockholders at stockholders meetings;\n\u00b7\nprohibit our stockholders from calling a special meeting and prohibit stockholders from acting by written consent;\n\u00b7\nrequire 662/3% stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws; and\n\u00b7\nprohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates.\nThese provisions could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions our stockholders desire.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third party claims against us and may reduce the amount of our available cash.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will indemnify our directors to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.\nIn addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL, our amended and restated bylaws and our indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our directors and officers provide that:\n\u00b7\nWe will indemnify our directors and officers for serving us in those capacities or for serving other business enterprises at our request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person\u2019s conduct was unlawful.\n\u00b7\nWe may, in our discretion, indemnify other employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law.\n\u00b7\nWe are required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or officers shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.\n\u00b7\nWe will not be obligated pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws to indemnify any director or officer in connection with any proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless the proceeding was authorized in the specific case by our Board of Directors or such indemnification is required to be made pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws.\n\u00b7\nThe rights conferred in our amended and restated bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons.\n\u00b7\nWe may not retroactively amend our amended and restated bylaw provisions to reduce our indemnification obligations to our directors or officers.\nAs a result, if we are required to indemnify one or more of our directors or officers, it may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third party claims against us, may reduce the amount of our available cash and may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to the Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein and the claim not being one which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery or for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. Any person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to this provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This choice of forum provision may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees and agents even though an action, if\nsuccessful, might benefit our stockholders. Stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. The Court of Chancery may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe do not expect to pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently expect to retain all future earnings, if any, for future operations and expansion, and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. As a result, stockholders may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless stockholders sell our common stock for a price greater than that which they paid for it.", "PERMNO": 15432, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ALPN"}
