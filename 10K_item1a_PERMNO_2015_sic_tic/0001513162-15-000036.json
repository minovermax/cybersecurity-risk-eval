{"cik": "715446", "company": "ITUS Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-01-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our business involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty, including the following risks and uncertainties:\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Operations\nWe have a history of losses and may incur additional losses in the future.\nOn a cumulative basis we have sustained substantial losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception. As of October 31, 2014, our accumulated deficit was approximately $144,770,000. As of October 31, 2014, we had approximately $5,861,000 in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, and working capital of approximately $4,512,000. We incurred losses of approximately $9,606,000 in fiscal year 2014. We expect to continue incurring significant legal and general and administrative expenses in connection with our operations. As a result, we anticipate that we will incur losses in the future.\nWe may need additional funding in the future which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and, if available, may result in dilution to our stockholders.\nBased on currently available information as of January 29, 2015, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable and expected cash flows from patent licensing and enforcement, and other potential sources of cash flows will be sufficient to enable us to continue our business activities for at least 12 months. However, our projections of future cash needs and cash flows may differ from actual results. If current cash on hand, cash equivalents, short term investments, accounts receivable and cash that may be generated from our business operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell equity securities or obtain loans from various financial institutions where possible. The sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt could result in dilution to our stockholders. Additionally, the sale of equity securities or issuance of debt securities may be subject to certain security holder approvals or may result in the downward adjustment of the exercise or conversion price of our outstanding securities. We can give no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flows in the future (through licensing and enforcement of patents, or otherwise) to satisfy our liquidity requirements or sustain future operations, or that other sources of funding, such as sales of equity or debt, would be available or would be approved by our security holders, if needed, on favorable terms or at all. If we cannot obtain such funding if needed or if we cannot sufficiently reduce operating expenses, we would need to curtail or cease some or all of our operations.\nIf we encounter unforeseen difficulties with our business or operations in the future that require us to obtain additional working capital, and we cannot obtain additional working capital on favorable terms, or at all, our business will suffer.\nOur consolidated cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand totaled approximately $5,861,000 and $898,000 at October 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. To date, we have relied primarily upon cash from the public and private sale of equity and debt securities to generate the working capital needed to finance our operations.\nAlthough we received aggregate gross proceeds of $4,000,000 from the registered direct offering that closed on July 15, 2014 (the \u201cRegistered Direct Offering\u201d), we may need substantial additional capital to continue to operate our business.\nWe may encounter unforeseen difficulties with our business or operations in the future that may deplete our capital resources more rapidly than anticipated. As a result, we may be required to obtain additional working capital in the future through bank credit facilities, public or private debt or equity financings, or otherwise. Other than as disclosed in this Annual Report, we have not identified other sources for additional funding and cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are required to raise additional working capital in the future, such financing may be unavailable to us on favorable terms, if at all, or may be dilutive to our existing stockholders. If we fail to obtain additional working capital as and when needed, such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, such lack of funds may inhibit our ability to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital needs, or may force us to reduce operating expenses, which would significantly harm the business and development of operations.\nFailure to effectively manage our potential growth could place strains on our managerial, operational and financial resources and could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur business strategy and potential growth is expected to place a strain on managerial, operational and financial resources and systems. Further, as our business grows, we will be required to manage multiple relationships as well as multiple patented technologies. Any growth by us, or an increase in the number of our strategic relationships or litigation, may place additional strain on our managerial, operational and financial resources and systems. Although we may not grow as we expect, if we fail to manage our growth effectively or to develop and expand our managerial, operational and financial resources and systems, our business and financial results will be materially harmed.\nRisks Related to Patent Monetization and Patent Assertion Activities\nWe may not be able to monetize our patent portfolios which may have an adverse impact on our future operations.\nThe primary operations of the Company are patent monetization. We expect to generate revenues and related cash flows from the licensing and enforcement of patents that we currently own and from the rights to license and enforce additional patents we have obtained, and may obtain in the future, from third parties. However, we can give no assurances that we will be able to identify opportunities to exploit such patents or that such opportunities, even if identified, will generate sufficient revenues to sustain future operations.\nOur revenues are unpredictable, may come from a small number of licensees, and may harm our financial condition and the market price of our stock.\nIn the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014, our revenue from patent assertion activities was derived from 27 license and/or settlement agreements, and a substantial portion of this revenue was derived from four of the agreements. It is likely that going forward, a substantial portion of our revenue in each reporting period may come from a small number of licensees, and that one licensee may account for a substantial portion of our revenue. As a result, our revenues may be unpredictable and may vary from period to period.\nIf we are unable to retain top legal counsel on a contingency basis or otherwise at a reasonable fee to represent us in patent enforcement litigation, it may adversely affect our business.\nThe success of our licensing business depends in part upon our ability to retain top legal counsel on a contingency fee basis or otherwise at a reasonable fee to represent us in patent infringement litigation. If our patent enforcement actions increase, it may become more difficult to find top legal counsel to handle all of our cases because many of the top law firms may have a conflict of interest that prevents their representation of us. In addition, the terms of retention of such firms may be unacceptable to us.\nWe, in certain circumstances, rely on representations, warranties and opinions made by third parties that, if determined to be false or inaccurate, may expose us to certain material liabilities.\nFrom time to time, we may rely upon the opinions of purported experts. In certain instances, we may not have the opportunity to independently investigate and verify the facts upon which such opinions are made. By relying on these opinions, we may be exposed to liabilities in connection with the licensing and enforcement of certain patents and patent rights which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIn connection with patent enforcement actions conducted by certain of our subsidiaries, a court that has ruled unfavorably against us may also impose sanctions or award attorney\u2019s fees, exposing us and our operating subsidiaries to certain material liabilities.\nIn connection with any of our patent enforcement actions, it is possible that a court that has ruled against us may also impose sanctions or award attorney\u2019s fees to defendants, exposing us or our operating subsidiaries to material liabilities, which could materially harm our operating results and our financial condition.\nNew legislation, regulations, rules and case-law related to obtaining patents or enforcing patents could significantly increase our operating costs and decrease our revenue.\nWe may obtain the rights to patents and may spend a significant amount of resources to enforce those patents. If new legislation, regulations or rules are implemented either by Congress, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d), or the courts, that impact the patent enforcement process or the rights of patent holders, these changes could negatively affect our expenses and revenue. For example, new rules regarding the burden of proof in patent enforcement actions could significantly increase the cost of our enforcement actions, new standards or limitations on liability for patent infringement could negatively impact our revenue derived from such enforcement actions, and potential new rules requiring that the losing party pay legal fees of the prevailing party could also significantly increase the cost of our enforcement actions.\nUnited States patent laws were recently amended with the enactment of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the America Invents Act, which took effect on March 16, 2013. The America Invents Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. In general, the legislation attempts to address issues surrounding the enforceability of patents and the increase in patent litigation by, among other things, establishing new procedures for patent litigation. For example, the America Invents Act changes the way that parties may be joined in patent infringement actions, increasing the likelihood that such actions will need to be brought against individual parties allegedly infringing by their respective individual actions or activities. The America Invents Act and its implementation increases the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of our patented technologies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) has conducted reviews of the patent system to evaluate the impact of patent assertion entities on industries in which those patents relate. It is possible that the findings and recommendations of the DOJ could impact the ability to effectively license and enforce standards-essential patents and could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of any such patented technologies.\nFurther, in various pending litigation and appeals in the United States Federal courts, various arguments and legal theories are being advanced to potentially limit the scope of damages a patent licensing company such as the Company might be entitled to. Any one of these pending cases could result in new legal doctrines that could make our existing or future patent portfolios less valuable or more costly to enforce.\nMore patent applications are filed each year resulting in longer delays in getting patents issued by the USPTO.\nWe hold a number of pending patents. We have identified a trend of increasing patent applications each year, which we believe is resulting in longer delays in obtaining approval of pending patent applications. The application delays could cause delays in recognizing revenue, if any, from these patents and could cause us to miss opportunities to license patents before other competing technologies are developed or introduced into the market.\nU.S. Federal courts are becoming more crowded, and as a result, patent enforcement litigation is taking longer.\nPatent enforcement actions are almost exclusively prosecuted in U.S. Federal court. Federal trial courts that hear patent enforcement actions also hear criminal cases. Criminal cases always take priority over patent enforcement actions. As a result, it is difficult to predict the length of time it will take to complete an enforcement action. Moreover, we believe there is a trend in increasing numbers of civil lawsuits and criminal proceedings before United States Judges, and as a result, we believe that the risk of delays in patent enforcement actions will have a significant effect on our business in the future unless this trend changes.\nTable of Contents Any reductions in the funding of the USPTO could have an adverse impact on the cost of processing pending patent applications and the value of those pending patent applications.\nOur primary asset is our patent portfolios, including pending patent applications before the USPTO. The value of our patent portfolios is dependent upon the issuance of patents in a timely manner, and any reductions in the funding of the USPTO could negatively impact the value of our assets. Further, reductions in funding from Congress could result in higher patent application filing and maintenance fees charged by the USPTO, causing an unexpected increase in our expenses.\nCompetition is intense in the industries in which we do business and as a result, we may not be able to grow or maintain our market share for our technologies and patents.\nOur licensing business may compete with venture capital firms and various industry leaders for technology licensing opportunities. Many of these competitors may have more financial and human resources than we do. As we become more successful, we may find more companies entering the market for similar technology opportunities, which may reduce our market share in one or more technology industries that we currently rely upon to generate future revenue.\nOur patented technologies have an uncertain market value.\nMany of our patents and technologies are in the early stages of adoption in the commercial and consumer markets. Demand for some of these technologies is untested and is subject to fluctuation based upon the rate at which our licensees will adopt our patents and technologies in their products and services.\nAs patent enforcement litigation becomes more prevalent, it may become more difficult for us to voluntarily license our patents.\nWe believe that the more prevalent patent enforcement actions become, the more difficult it will be for us to voluntarily license our patents. As a result, we may need to increase the number of our patent enforcement actions to cause infringing companies to license the patent or pay damages for lost royalties. This may increase the risks associated with an investment in our company.\nWe may choose to further develop our patented technologies or invest in new patented technologies which are in need of development.\nEarly stage technologies involve a high degree of risk, and the development of early stage technologies can be capital intensive. Should we decide to further develop our patented technologies, or invest in new patented technologies, we may not have the capital necessary to continually fund the development of the technologies, and the likelihood of achieving commercial success with any early stage technology is highly speculative.\nWeak global economic conditions may cause infringing parties to delay entering into licensing agreements, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nOur business plan depends significantly on economic conditions, and the United States and world economies are only beginning to emerge from weak economic conditions. Uncertainty about global economic conditions poses a risk as businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and declines in income or asset values. This response could have a material negative effect on the willingness of parties infringing on our patent assets to enter into licensing or other revenue generating agreements voluntarily which could cause material harm to our business.\nWe are dependent upon a few key personnel and the loss of their services could adversely affect us.\nOur future success to monetize our patent portfolios will depend on the efforts of our President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert A. Berman, and our Senior Vice President - Engineering, John Roop, and our strategic advisor, Dr. Amit Kumar. While we maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance on Mr. Berman, we do not maintain such \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance on Messrs. Roop or Dr. Kumar. The loss of the services of any such persons could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe availability of shares for sale in the future could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may issue securities to raise cash for operations and acquisitions of patents and/or companies. We have and in the future may issue securities convertible into our common stock. Any of these events may dilute stockholders' ownership interests in our company and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nIn addition, sales of a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could reduce the market price of our common stock. This could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our securities.\nAny actual or anticipated sales of shares by our stockholders or by Aspire Capital Fund, LLC (\u201cAspire Capital\u201d) may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. Additional issuances of shares to Aspire Capital may result in dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by our stockholders including Aspire Capital, or anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales.\nDelaware law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover of our company that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares.\nProvisions of Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d) and our certificate of incorporation, as amended (the \u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d) and by-laws (\u201cBy-Laws\u201d) could make the acquisition of our company by means of a tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, and the removal of incumbent officers and directors, more difficult. These provisions include:\n\u00b7 Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits a merger with a 15%-or-greater stockholder, such as a party that has completed a successful tender offer, until three years after that party became a 15%-or-greater stockholder;\n\u00b7 The authorization in our Certificate of Incorporation of undesignated preferred stock, which could be issued without stockholder approval in a manner designed to prevent or discourage a takeover; and\n\u00b7 Provisions in our By-Laws regarding stockholders' rights to call a special meeting of stockholders limit such rights to stockholders holding together at least a majority of shares of the Company entitled to vote at the meeting, which could make it more difficult for stockholders to wage a proxy contest for control of our Board of Directors or to vote to repeal any of the anti-takeover provisions contained in our Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws.\nTogether, these provisions may make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that could otherwise involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nWe may fail to meet market expectations because of fluctuations in quarterly operating results, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nOur reported revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future. It is possible that in future periods, revenues could fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. The following are among the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period:\n\u00b7 the dollar amount of agreements executed in each period, which is primarily driven by the nature and characteristics of the technology being licensed and/or the magnitude of infringement associated with a specific licensee;\n\u00b7 the specific terms and conditions of agreements executed in each period and/or the periods of infringement contemplated by the respective payments;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in the total number of agreements executed;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in the sales results or other royalty-per-unit activities of our licensees that impact the calculation of license fees due;\n\u00b7 the timing of the receipt of periodic license fee payments and/or reports from licensees;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in the net number of active licensees period to period;\n\u00b7 costs related to acquisitions, alliances, licenses and other efforts to expand our operations;\n\u00b7 the timing of payments under the terms of any customer or license agreements into which we may enter;\n\u00b7 expenses related to, and the timing and results of, patent filings and other enforcement proceedings relating to intellectual property rights, as more fully described in this section; and\n\u00b7 the outcome of any of our patent infringement lawsuits.\nTechnology company stock prices are especially volatile, and this volatility may depress the price of our common stock.\nThe stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, and the market prices of technology companies have been highly volatile. We believe that various factors may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including, among others, the following:\n\u00b7 announcements of developments in our patent enforcement actions;\n\u00b7 developments or disputes concerning our patents;\n\u00b7 our or our competitors' technological innovations;\n\u00b7 developments in relationships with licensees;\n\u00b7 variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7 our failure to meet or exceed securities analysts' expectations of our financial results;\n\u00b7 a change in financial estimates or securities analysts' recommendations;\n\u00b7 changes in management's or securities analysts' estimates of our financial performance;\n\u00b7 changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u00b7 the current sovereign debt crises affecting several countries in the European Union and concerns about sovereign debt of the United States;\n\u00b7 announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, new technologies, or patents; and\n\u00b7 the timing of or our failure to complete significant transactions.\nIn addition, we believe that fluctuations in our stock price during applicable periods can also be impacted by court rulings and/or other developments in our patent licensing and enforcement actions. Court rulings in patent enforcement actions are often difficult to understand, even when favorable or neutral to the value of our patents and our overall business, and we believe that investors in the market may overreact, causing fluctuations in our stock prices that may not accurately reflect the impact of court rulings on our business operations and assets.\nIn the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the objects of securities class action litigation. If our common stock was the object of securities class action litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources, which could materially harm our business and financial results.\nOur common stock is subject to the SEC\u2019s penny stock rules which may make our shares more difficult to sell.\nOur common stock fits the definition of a penny stock and therefore is subject to the rules adopted by the SEC regulating broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. The SEC rules may have the effect of reducing trading activity in our common stock making it more difficult for investors to sell their shares. The SEC\u2019s rules require a broker or dealer proposing to effect a transaction in a penny stock to deliver the customer a risk disclosure document that provides certain information prescribed by the SEC, including, but not limited to, the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker or dealer must also disclose the aggregate amount of any compensation received or receivable by him in connection with such transaction prior to consummating the transaction. In addition, the SEC\u2019s rules also require a broker or dealer to make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction before completion of the transaction. The existence of the SEC\u2019s rules may result in a lower trading volume of our common stock and lower trading prices.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on our common stock which may adversely impact the market price of our stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not plan to pay any cash dividends in the near future. Our current policy is to retain all funds and any earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. If we do not pay dividends, our stock may be less valuable to you because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.\nTable of Contents The securities issued in our private placements and registered direct offering may dilute your percentage ownership interest and may also result in downward pressure on the price of our common stock.\nIn connection with our private placements in February 2011, January 2013 and November 2013 and our registered direct offering in July 2014, we have outstanding shares of preferred stock (following the conversion of the Debenture issued in November 2013) and warrants which are convertible into or exercisable for an aggregate of 25,623,281 shares of our common stock, at prices ranging from $0.1786 to $0.40 per share. In addition, as we are required to register these shares for resale by the holders, it is possible that a significant number of shares could be sold at the same time. Because the market for our common stock is thinly traded, the sales and/or the perception that those sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, the mere existence of a significant number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the debentures or the exercise of warrants may be perceived by the market as having a potential dilutive effect, which could lead to a decrease in the price of our common stock.\nThe sale of our common stock to Aspire Capital may cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and the sale, actual or anticipated, of the shares of common stock acquired by Aspire Capital could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe have the right to sell up to $10 million of our shares of common stock to Aspire Capital, including the 5,380,000 shares sold to Aspire Capital since April 23, 2013, and have issued 3,500,000 shares to Aspire Capital as a commitment fee. We were obligated to register these shares with the SEC. The registration statement declared effective by the SEC on June 19, 2013 (post-effective amendment no. 1 of the registration statement updating the registration statement was declared effective on February 5, 2014) registers 20,000,000 shares for issuance and sale to Aspire Capital under the Purchase Agreement. It is anticipated that these shares will be sold by Aspire Capital pursuant to a registration statement or sold in reliance on an exemption from registration in Rule 144 of the Securities Act.\nAny actual or anticipated sales of shares by Aspire Capital may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. Additional issuances of shares to Aspire Capital may result in dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock. However, we have the right to control the timing and amount of sales of our shares to Aspire Capital, and the purchase agreement may be terminated by us at any time at our discretion without any penalty or cost to us.\nWe may not have access to the full amount available under the Stock Purchase Agreement with Aspire Capital.\nIn order for us to receive the full $10 million proceeds under the Stock Purchase Agreement it is unlikely that the 20,000,000 shares registered will be sufficient. Accordingly, our ability to have access to the full amount under that certain common Stock Purchase Agreement (the \"Stock Purchase Agreement\") with Aspire Capital will likely be subject to our ability to prepare and file one or more additional registration statements registering the resale of additional shares. These subsequent registration statements may be subject to review and comment by the staff of the SEC, and will require the consent of our independent registered public accounting firm. Therefore, the timing of effectiveness of these subsequent registration statements cannot be assured. The effectiveness of these subsequent registration statements is a condition precedent to our ability to sell the shares of common stock subject to these subsequent registration statements to Aspire Capital under the Stock Purchase Agreement.\nRaising funds by issuing equity or debt securities could dilute the value of the common stock and impose restrictions on our working capital.\nIf we were to raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, including sales of shares of common stock to Aspire Capital, the value of the then outstanding common stock would be reduced, unless the additional equity securities were issued at a price equal to or greater than the market value of the common stock at the time of issuance of the new securities. If the additional equity securities were issued at a per share price less than the per share value of the outstanding shares, then all of the outstanding shares would suffer a dilution in value with the issuance of such additional shares. Further, the issuance of debt securities in order to obtain additional funds may impose restrictions on our operations and may impair our working capital as we service any such debt obligations.", "PERMNO": 27167, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ANIX"}
