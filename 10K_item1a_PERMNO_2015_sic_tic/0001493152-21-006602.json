RISK FACTORS.\nThe following risk factors, together with all of the other information included or incorporated in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, should be carefully considered. If any of the following risks, either alone or taken together, or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to not be significant, develop into actual events, then our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected. If that happens, the market price of our common stock could decline, and stockholders may lose all or part of their investment.\nRisk Factor Summary\nWe are providing the following summary of the risk factors contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to enhance the readability and accessibility of our risk factor disclosures. We encourage you to carefully review the full risk factors contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in their entirety for additional information regarding the material factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf We have a history of net losses and may experience future losses;\n\u25cf We will need to raise additional capital to meet our business requirements in the future and such capital raising may be costly or difficult to obtain and could dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership interests;\n\u25cf We are a clinical development stage biotechnology company and have never been profitable;\n\u25cf All of our product candidates are still under development, and there can be no assurance of successful commercialization of any of our products;\n\u25cf Drug development is a long, expensive, and inherently uncertain process with a high risk of failure at every stage of development, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results;\n\u25cf If our collaborators are not successful, we may not effectively develop and market some of our therapeutic candidates;\n\u25cf We face substantial competition in the development of our product candidates and may not be able to compete successfully, and our product candidates may be rendered obsolete by rapid technological change;\n\u25cf If the third parties on which we rely to conduct our clinical trials and to assist us with preclinical development do not perform as contractually required or expected, we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for, or to commercialize, our products;\n\u25cf Our failure to successfully acquire, develop and market additional drug candidates or approved drug products could impair our ability to grow;\n\u25cf We may be subject to claims that our employees, independent consultants or agencies have wrongfully used or inadvertently disclosed confidential information of third parties;\n\u25cf The COVID-19 pandemic has caused interruptions or delays of our clinical studies and may have a significant adverse effect on our business;\n\u25cf Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations;\n\u25cf Our product candidates must undergo rigorous nonclinical and clinical testing, and we must obtain regulatory approvals, which could be costly and time-consuming and subject us to unanticipated delays or prevent us from marketing any products;\n\u25cf We cannot be certain that any of our current and future product candidates will receive regulatory approval, and without regulatory approval we will not be able to market our product candidates;\n\u25cf We have limited experience in filing and pursuing applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals, which may impede our ability to obtain timely approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) or foreign regulatory agencies, if at all;\n\u25cf We and our third-party manufacturers are, and will be, subject to regulations of the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our rights to intellectual property, causing us to lose valuable rights. Loss of patent rights may lead us to lose market share and anticipated profits;\n\u25cf Legal proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement and other challenges may require us to spend substantial time and money and could prevent us from developing or commercializing our product candidates;\n\u25cf The price of Company Common Stock is subject to fluctuation and has been, and may, continue to be volatile;\n\u25cf Financial reporting obligations of being a public company in the United States are expensive and time-consuming, and our management may be required to devote substantial time to compliance matters;\n\u25cf Anti-takeover provisions under Delaware corporate law may make it difficult for our stockholders to replace or remove our board of directors and could deter or delay third parties from acquiring us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders; and\n\u25cf Protective provisions in our charter and bylaws could prevent a takeover which could harm our stockholders.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of net losses and may experience future losses.\nWe have yet to establish any history of profitable operations. We reported a net loss of $19.3 million and $20.6 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $234.5 million. We expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve sufficient revenues throughout the year or be profitable in the future.\nWe will need to raise additional capital to meet our business requirements in the future and such capital raises may be costly or difficult to obtain and could dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership interests.\nOur current capital will be sufficient to enable us to continue operations for at least 12 months following the filing date of this Annual Report. In order to continue our operations and to fully realize all of our business objectives, absent any non-dilutive funding from a strategic partner or some other strategic transactions, we will need to raise additional capital, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. For instance, we will need to raise additional funds to accomplish the following:\n\u25cf advancing the research and development of our therapeutic candidates;\n\u25cf investing in protecting and expanding our intellectual property portfolio, including filing for additional patents to strengthen our intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf hiring and retaining qualified management and key employees;\n\u25cf responding to competitive pressures; and\n\u25cf maintaining compliance with applicable laws.\nAny additional capital raised through the sale of equity or equity backed securities will dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership percentages and could also result in a decrease in the market value of our equity securities.\nThe terms of any securities issued by us in future financing transactions may be more favorable to new investors, and may include preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect on the holders of any of our securities then outstanding.\nFurthermore, any additional capital financing that we may need in the future may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we are unable to obtain such additional financing on a timely basis, we may have to curtail our development activities and growth plans and/or be forced to sell assets, perhaps on unfavorable terms, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately could be forced to discontinue our operations and liquidate, in which event it is unlikely that stockholders would receive any distribution on their shares. Further, we may not be able to continue operating if we do not generate sufficient revenues from operations needed to stay in business.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which may adversely impact our financial condition and cause further dilution to our stockholders.\nWe are a clinical development stage biotechnology company and have never been profitable. We expect to incur additional losses in the future and may never be profitable.\nWe are a clinical development stage biotechnology company. We have not commercialized any product candidates or recognized any revenues from our product sales. All of our product candidates are still in the preclinical or clinical development stage, and none have been approved for marketing or are currently being marketed or commercialized. Our product candidates will require significant additional development, clinical studies, regulatory clearances and additional investments of time and capital before they can be commercialized. We cannot be certain when or if any of our product candidates will obtain the required regulatory approval.\nWe have never been profitable and have incurred net losses each year since our inception. Our losses are principally a result of research and development and general administrative expenses in support of our operations. We may incur significant additional losses as we continue to focus our resources on prioritizing, selecting and advancing our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends mainly upon our ability, alone or with others, to successfully develop our product candidates, obtain the required regulatory approvals in various territories and commercialize our product candidates. We may be unable to achieve any or all of these goals with regard to our product candidates. As a result, we may never be profitable or achieve significant and/or sustained revenues.\nAll of our product candidates are still under development, and there can be no assurance of successful commercialization of any of our products.\nAll of our research and development programs are in developmental stages. One or more of our product candidates may fail to meet safety and efficacy standards in human testing, even if those product candidates are found to be effective in animal studies. To develop and commercialize inhaled therapeutic treatment for ABPA, acute migraine, and other iSPERSE-based product candidates, we must provide the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities with human clinical and non-clinical animal data that demonstrate adequate safety and effectiveness. To generate these data, we will have to subject our product candidates to significant additional research and development efforts, including extensive non-clinical studies and clinical testing. Our approach to drug discovery may not be effective or may not result in the development of any drug. Currently our development efforts are primarily focused on Pulmazole, PUR1800, and PUR3100. Even if Pulmazole, PUR1800, PUR3100 or our other product candidates are successful when tested in animals, such success would not be a guarantee of the safety or effectiveness of such product candidates in humans. It can take several years for a product to be approved and we may not be successful in bringing any therapeutic candidates to the market. A new drug may appear promising at an early stage of development or after clinical trials and never reach the market, or it may reach the market and not sell, for a variety of reasons. For example, the drug may:\n\u25cf be shown to be ineffective or to cause harmful side effects during preclinical testing or clinical trials;\n\u25cf fail to receive regulatory approval on a timely basis or at all;\n\u25cf be difficult to manufacture on a large scale;\n\u25cf not be economically viable;\n\u25cf not be prescribed by doctors or accepted by patients;\n\u25cf fail to receive a sufficient level of reimbursement from government, insurers or other third-party payors; or\n\u25cf infringe on intellectual property rights of any other party.\nIf our delivery platform technologies or product development efforts fail to generate product candidates that lead to the successful development and commercialization of products, our business and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.\nOn December 26, 2019, we entered into the Johnson & Johnson Enterprise Innovation, Inc. (\u201cJJEI\u201d) License Agreement. Under the terms of the JJEI License Agreement, we have granted JJEI an option to acquire (1) JJEI\u2019s rights to an intellectual property portfolio of materials and technology related to narrow spectrum kinase inhibitor compounds and (2) an exclusive, worldwide, royalty bearing license to PUR1800. JJEI will have three months from the later of the completion of a Phase 1b clinical study for PUR1800 and JJEI\u2019s receipt of audited draft reports for a toxicology study of PUR1800 to exercise the option. We will be conducting the Phase 1b clinical study and the chronic toxicology program. If our Phase 1b clinical study or the chronic toxicology program is not successful, we may jeopardize the fulfillment of the option to JJEI under the JJEI License Agreement, thereby hurting our product development efforts and potential to earn royalty payments, which will in turn negatively influence our financial condition. Furthermore, JJEI may terminate the JJEI License Agreement for any reason upon 90 days advance written notice. We cannot predict JJEI\u2019s decision to terminate the JJEI License Agreement. The termination of the JJEI License Agreement may negatively influence our financial condition.\nDue to delays in patient enrollment in the Pulmazole Phase 2 clinical study, exacerbated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Cipla Technologies, LLC (\u201cCipla\u201d), with whom we entered into a development and commercialization agreement (the \u201cCipla Agreement\u201d) on April 15, 2019 for the development and commercialization of Pulmazole, informed us that it desired to amend the Cipla Agreement. In connection with our renegotiation of the Cipla Agreement, on July 10, 2020, the joint steering committee established by us and Cipla terminated the Phase 2 study in order to facilitate the commencement of a newly designed Phase 2b study that would supersede the prior Phase 2 study. We have not agreed to any amendments to the Cipla Agreement as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report. However, we expect that discussions regarding amendments to the Cipla Agreement will continue. No assurance can be given that we will be able to reach a mutually acceptable arrangement with Cipla for the conduct of any proposed Phase 2b clinical study in the future. Accordingly, if we are unable to agree with Cipla on such matters such as cost sharing for the new study, we may be forced to suspend further development of Pulmazole.\nDrug development is a long, expensive and inherently uncertain process with a high risk of failure at every stage of development, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nWe have a number of proprietary drug candidates in research and development ranging from the early discovery research phase through preclinical testing and clinical trials. Preclinical testing and clinical trials are long, expensive and highly uncertain processes. It will take us several years to complete clinical trials and we may not have the resources to complete the development and commercialization of any of our proposed drug candidates. The start or end of a clinical trial is often delayed or halted due to changing regulatory requirements, manufacturing challenges, required clinical trial administrative actions, slower than anticipated patient enrollment, changing standards of care, availability or prevalence of use of a competitor drug or required prior therapy, clinical outcomes, or financial constraints of us and our partners.\nDrug development is a highly uncertain scientific and medical endeavor, and failure can unexpectedly occur at any stage of preclinical and clinical development. Typically, there is a high rate of attrition for drug candidates in preclinical and clinical trials due to scientific feasibility, safety, efficacy, changing standards of medical care and other variables. The risk of failure is heightened for our drug candidates that are based on new technologies, such as the application of our dry powder delivery platform, iSPERSE, including Pulmazole, PUR1800, PUR3100 and other iSPERSE-based drug candidates currently in discovery research or preclinical development. The failure of one or more of our iSPERSE-based drug candidates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials of previously published iSPERSE-based products may not necessarily be indicative of the results of our future clinical trials. The design of our clinical trials is based on many assumptions about the expected effects of inhaled drugs used historically in the industry and if those assumptions are incorrect, the trials may not produce statistically significant results. Preliminary results may not be confirmed upon full analysis of the detailed results of an early clinical trial. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show safety and efficacy sufficient to support intended use claims despite having progressed through initial clinical trials. The data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere. Because of the uncertainties associated with drug development and regulatory approval, we cannot determine if, or when, we may have an approved product for commercialization or whether we will ever achieve sales of or profits on our product candidates or those we may pursue in the future.\nIf our collaborators are not successful, we may not effectively develop and market some of our therapeutic candidates.\nWe have entered into co-development agreements regarding two of our therapeutic candidates and, as a result, we no longer have complete control over the development of these candidates. If our collaborators do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be delayed or may not obtain regulatory approval for, or commercialize, our product candidates. If our relationships with these collaborators terminate, we believe that we would be able to enter into arrangements with alternative third parties. However, replacing any of these collaborators could delay our clinical trials and could jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approvals and commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis, if at all.\nWe may not be able to attract, retain, or manage highly qualified personnel, which could adversely impact our business.\nOur future success and ability to compete in the biotechnology industry is substantially dependent on our ability to identify, attract, and retain highly qualified key managerial, scientific, medical, and operations personnel. The market for key employees in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is competitive. The loss of the services of any of our principal members of management or key employees without an adequate replacement or our inability to hire new employees as needed could delay our product development efforts, harm our ability to sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business.\nThe scientific, research and development personnel upon whom we rely to operate our business have expertise in certain aspects of drug development and clinical development, and it may be difficult to retain or replace these individuals. We conduct our operations at our facilities in Lexington, Massachusetts, within the greater Boston area, and this region is headquarters to many other biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and medical technology companies, as well as many academic and research institutions, and, therefore, we face increased competition for technical and managerial personnel in this region.\nIn addition, we have scientific, medical and clinical advisors who assist us in designing and formulating our products and with development and clinical strategies. These advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us, or may have arrangements with other companies to assist in the development of products that may compete with ours.\nDespite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management and scientific and development teams may terminate their employment with us at any time. Although we have written employment offer letter agreements with our executive officers, our executive officers can leave their employment at any time, for any reason, with 30 days\u2019 notice. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or our other key employees and our inability to find suitable replacements could potentially harm our business, financial condition and prospects. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies on the lives of these individuals or the lives of any of our other employees.\nWe face substantial competition in the development of our product candidates and may not be able to compete successfully, and our product candidates may be rendered obsolete by rapid technological change.\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is highly competitive, and we face significant competition from many pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are researching and marketing products designed to address the indications for which we are currently developing therapeutic candidates or for which we may develop product candidates in the future.\nMany of our existing or potential competitors have, or have access to, substantially greater financial, research and development, production, and sales and marketing resources than we do and have a greater depth and number of experienced managers. As a result, our competitors may be better equipped than us to develop, manufacture, market and sell competing products. In addition, gaining favorable reimbursement is critical to the success of our product candidates. We are aware of many established pharmaceutical companies in the United States and other parts of the world that have or are developing technologies for inhaled drug delivery for the prevention and treatment of respiratory diseases, including GlaxoSmithKline, Mereo BioPharma, Mylan, Savara, Insmed, Satsuma, Bristol-Meyers, TFF Pharmaceuticals, Zambon Pharma and Pulmocide, which we consider our potential competitors in this regard. If we are unable to compete successfully with these and other potential future competitors, we may be unable to grow or generate revenue.\nThe rapid rate of scientific discoveries and technological changes could result in one or more of our product candidates becoming obsolete or noncompetitive. Our competitors may develop or introduce new products that render our iSPERSE delivery technology and other product candidates less competitive, uneconomical or obsolete. Some of these technologies may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing similar therapeutic effects compared to our drug candidates. Our future success will depend not only on our ability to develop our product candidates but to improve them and keep pace with emerging industry developments. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so.\nWe also expect to face increasing competition from universities and other non-profit research organizations. These institutions carry out a significant amount of research and development in the areas of respiratory diseases. These institutions are becoming increasingly aware of the commercial value of their findings and are more active in seeking patent and other proprietary rights as well as licensing revenues.\nThe potential acceptance of therapeutics that are alternatives to ours may limit market acceptance of our product candidates, even if commercialized. Respiratory diseases, including our targeted diseases and conditions, can also be treated by other medication or drug delivery technologies. These treatments may be widely accepted in medical communities and have a longer history of use. The established use of these competitive drugs may limit the potential for our product candidates to receive widespread acceptance if commercialized.\nIf the third parties on which we rely to conduct our clinical trials and to assist us with preclinical development do not perform as contractually required or expected, we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for, or to commercialize, our products.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct our preclinical and clinical trials for our products and we must rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct such trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if these third parties need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our preclinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, our products on a timely basis, if at all, and our business, operating results and prospects may be adversely affected. Furthermore, our third-party clinical trial investigators may be delayed in conducting our clinical trials for reasons outside of our control.\nWe rely on third party contract vendors to manufacture and supply us with high quality active pharmaceutical ingredients and manufacture our therapeutic candidates in the quantities we require on a timely basis.\nWe currently do not manufacture any active pharmaceutical ingredients (\u201cAPIs\u201d). Instead, we rely on third-party vendors for the manufacture and supply of our APIs that are used to formulate our therapeutic candidates. We also do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities and therefore rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to manufacture clinical and commercial quantities of our therapeutic candidates and for quality assurance related to regulatory compliance. If these suppliers or manufacturers are incapable or unwilling to meet our current or future needs at our standards or on acceptable terms, if at all, we may be unable to locate alternative suppliers or manufacturers on acceptable terms, if at all, or produce necessary materials or components on our own.\nWhile there may be several alternative suppliers of API in the market, changing API suppliers or finding and qualifying new API suppliers can be costly and can take a significant amount of time. Many APIs require significant lead time to manufacture. There can also be challenges in maintaining similar quality or technical standards from one manufacturing batch to the next. We place purchase orders with a single supplier to supply the API, and we could experience a delay in conducting clinical trials of or obtaining regulatory approval for Pulmazole, PUR1800, PUR3100 or our other drug candidates and incur additional costs if we changed from this supplier for any reason. Similarly, replacing our manufacturers could cause us to incur added costs and experience delays in identifying, engaging, qualifying and training any such replacements.\nIf we are not able to find stable, affordable, high quality, or reliable supplies of the APIs, or if we are unable to maintain our existing or future third-party manufacturing arrangements, we may not be able to produce enough supply of our therapeutic candidates or commercialize any therapeutic candidates on a timely and competitive basis, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in negotiating for an appropriate price in a future sale or assignment of our rights related to our current drug candidates.\nWe may seek to sell or assign our rights related to our current drug candidates. If completed, any such sale or assignment may be at a substantial discount, the consideration received may not accurately represent the value of the assets sold or assigned and our stockholders may not be entitled to participate in the future prospects of such drug candidates.\nOur failure to successfully acquire, develop and market additional drug candidates or approved drug products could impair our ability to grow.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may evaluate, acquire, license, develop and/or market additional product candidates and technologies, subject to the availability of adequate financing. However, our internal research capabilities are limited, and we may be dependent upon pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic scientists and other researchers to sell or license products or technology to us. The success of this strategy depends partly upon our ability to identify, select and acquire promising pharmaceutical product candidates and products. The process of proposing, negotiating and implementing a license or acquisition of a product candidate or approved product is lengthy and complex. Other companies, including some with substantially greater financial, marketing and sales resources, may compete with us for the license or acquisition of product candidates and approved products. We have limited resources to identify and execute the acquisition or in-licensing of third-party products, businesses and technologies and integrate them into our current infrastructure. Moreover, we may devote resources to potential acquisitions or in-licensing opportunities that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts. We may not be able to acquire the rights to additional product candidates on terms that we find acceptable, or at all.\nAny product candidate that we acquire may require additional development efforts prior to commercial sale, including extensive clinical testing and approval by the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities. All product candidates are prone to risks of failure typical of pharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that a product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that any products that we develop or approved products that we acquire will be manufactured profitably or achieve market acceptance. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully conduct the preclinical studies of the identified potential product candidates as anticipated.\nOur business strategy may include entry into additional collaborative or license agreements. We may not be able to enter into collaborative or license agreements or may not be able to negotiate commercially acceptable terms for these agreements.\nOur current business strategy may include the entry into additional collaborative or license agreements for the development and commercialization of our product candidates and technologies. The negotiation and consummation of these types of agreements typically involve simultaneous discussions with multiple potential collaborators or licensees and require significant time and resources. In addition, in attracting the attention of pharmaceutical and biotechnology company collaborators or licensees, we compete with numerous other third parties with product opportunities as well as the collaborators\u2019 or licensees\u2019 own internal product opportunities. We may not be able to consummate collaborative or license agreements, or we may not be able to negotiate commercially acceptable terms for these agreements.\nIf we do enter into such arrangements, we could be dependent upon the subsequent success of these other parties in performing their respective responsibilities and the cooperation of our partners. Our collaborators may not cooperate with us or perform their obligations under our agreements with them. We cannot control the amount and timing of our collaborators\u2019 resources that will be devoted to researching our product candidates pursuant to our collaborative agreements with them. Our collaborators may choose to pursue existing or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us. If we do not consummate collaborative or license agreements, we may use our financial resources more rapidly on our product development efforts, continue to defer certain development activities or forego the exploitation of certain geographic territories, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects. Further, we may not be successful in overseeing any such collaborative arrangements. If we fail to establish and maintain necessary collaborative or license relationships, our business prospects could suffer.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, independent consultants or agencies have wrongfully used or inadvertently disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nWe employ individuals and contract with independent consultants and agencies that may have previously worked at or conducted business with third parties; and, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or agencies have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of our employees\u2019 former employers or other third parties. We may also be subject to claims that our employees\u2019 former employers or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. There is no guarantee of success in defending these claims, and if we are successful, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and other employees.\nMarket and economic conditions may negatively impact our business, financial condition and share price.\nConcerns over inflation, low energy prices, geopolitical issues, the U.S. financial markets and a declining real estate market, unstable global credit markets and financial conditions, and volatile oil prices have led to periods of significant economic instability, diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence and discretionary spending, diminished expectations for the global economy and expectations of slower global economic growth going forward, increased unemployment rates, and increased credit defaults in recent years. Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by any such economic downturns, volatile business environments and continued unstable or unpredictable economic and market conditions. If these conditions continue to deteriorate or do not improve, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to complete, more costly, and more dilutive. In addition, there is a risk that one or more of our current and future service providers, manufacturers, suppliers, hospitals and other medical facilities, our third-party payors, and other partners could be negatively affected by difficult economic times, which could adversely affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget or meet our business and financial objectives.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused interruptions or delays of our clinical studies and may have a significant adverse effect on our business\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in, and is likely to result in, substantial disruptions to markets and economies around the world, including government-imposed quarantines, travel restrictions and other public health safety measures. We terminated our Phase 2 clinical study for Pulmazole as a result of the disruptions and safety concerns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe plan to initiate a Phase 2b clinical study for Pulmazole when the conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic are favorable with respect to study conduct and patient enrollment, and have commenced a Phase 1b study of PUR1800 in stable moderate-severe COPD patients in February 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic could delay these studies or impact enrollment generally to the extent we cannot secure sites to enroll patients, patients remain or become subject to government \u201cstay at home\u201d mandates, patients feel like they cannot safely visit trial sites or patients drop out due to COVID-19 related issues. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, but the enrollment of patients in our study may be delayed or suspended should there be an outbreak of COVID-19 in areas where we are conducting trials, as hospitals and clinics in those regions may shift resources to patients affected by the disease. Additionally, if our trial participants are unable to travel to our clinical trial sites as a result of quarantines or other restrictions resulting from COVID-19, we may experience higher drop-out rates or delays in our clinical trials. Government-imposed quarantines and restrictions may also require us to temporarily terminate our clinical sites. Furthermore, if we determine that our trial participants may suffer from exposure to COVID-19 as a result of their participation in our clinical trials, we may voluntarily terminate certain clinical sites as a safety measure until we reasonably believe that the likelihood of exposure has subsided. As a result, our expected development timeline for Pulmazole and PUR1800 may be negatively impacted. Moreover, the Covid-19 pandemic has begun to have indeterminable adverse effects on general commercial activity and the world economy, and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent that this Covid-19 pandemic or any other pandemic harms the global economy generally. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 outbreak as consequences of such health pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impact on our business, our clinical trials or the global economy as a whole. However, any one or a combination of these events could have an adverse effect on the operation of and results from our clinical trials and on our other business operations. We will continue to monitor the effects of COVID-19 on an ongoing basis.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and investors\u2019 views of us.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that will need to be evaluated frequently. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) requires public companies to conduct an annual review and evaluation of their internal controls. Our failure to maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls in accordance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to annual limitations on its ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes (\u201cNOLs\u201d), to offset future taxable income or reduce taxes. Our past issuances of stock and other changes in our stock ownership may have resulted in ownership changes within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code; accordingly, our pre-change NOLs may be subject to limitation under Section 382. If we determine that we have not undergone an ownership change, the Internal Revenue Service could challenge our analysis, and our ability to use our NOLs to offset taxable income could be limited by Section 382 of the Code. Future changes in our stock ownership, including in connection with our initial public offering, some of which are outside of our control, could result in ownership changes under Section 382 of the Code further limiting our ability to utilize our NOLs. Furthermore, our ability to use NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. For these reasons, we may not be able to use a material portion of the NOLs, even if we attain profitability.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nOur product candidates must undergo rigorous nonclinical and clinical testing, and we must obtain regulatory approvals, which could be costly and time-consuming and subject us to unanticipated delays or prevent us from marketing any products. We cannot be certain that any of our current and future product candidates will receive regulatory approval, and without regulatory approval we will not be able to market our product candidates.\nOur ability to generate revenue related to product sales, if ever, will depend on the successful development and regulatory approval of our product candidates. We currently have no products approved for sale, and we cannot guarantee that we will ever have marketable products. The development of a product candidate and issues relating to its approval and marketing are subject to extensive regulation, including regulation for safety, efficacy and quality, by the FDA in the United States and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries, with regulations differing from country to country. The FDA regulations and the regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities are wide-ranging and govern, among other things:\n\u25cf product design, development, manufacture and testing;\n\u25cf product labeling;\n\u25cf product storage and shipping;\n\u25cf pre-market clearance or approval;\n\u25cf advertising and promotion; and\n\u25cf product sales and distribution.\nClinical testing can be costly and take many years, and the outcome is uncertain and susceptible to varying interpretations. We cannot predict whether our current or future trials and studies will adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of any of our product candidates or whether regulators will agree with our conclusions regarding the preclinical studies and clinical trials we have conducted to date, including the clinical trials for Pulmazole. The clinical trials of our product candidates may not be completed on schedule, the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may order us to stop or modify our research, or these agencies may not ultimately approve any of our product candidates for commercial sale. The data collected from our clinical trials may not be sufficient to support regulatory approval of our various product candidates. Even if we believe the data collected from our clinical trials are sufficient, the FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may disagree with our interpretation of the data.\nWe are not permitted to market our product candidates in the United States until we receive approval of a new drug application (\u201cNDA\u201d) from the FDA. Obtaining approval of a NDA is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and we may not be successful in obtaining approval. The FDA review processes can take years to complete and approval is never guaranteed. We cannot be certain that any of our submissions will be accepted for filing and review by the FDA.\nThe requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates outside the United States vary widely from country to country. Foreign approvals may take longer to obtain than FDA approvals and can require, among other things, additional testing and different clinical trial designs. Foreign regulatory approval processes include essentially all of the risks associated with the FDA approval processes. Some of those agencies also must approve prices of the products. Approval of a product by the FDA does not ensure approval of the same product by the health authorities of other countries, or vice versa. In addition, changes in regulatory policy in the United States or in foreign countries for product approval during the period of product development and regulatory agency review of each submitted new application may cause delays or rejections.\nIf we are unable to obtain approval from the FDA or other regulatory agencies for our product candidates, or if, subsequent to approval, we are unable to successfully market and commercialize our product candidates, we will not be able to generate sufficient revenue to become profitable.\nWe have limited experience in filing and pursuing applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals, which may impede our ability to obtain timely approvals from the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies, if at all.\nAs a company, we have no experience in late-stage regulatory filings, such as preparing and submitting NDAs, which may place us at risk of delays, overspending and human resources inefficiencies. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, regulatory approval could harm our business.\nAny failure by us to comply with existing regulations could harm our reputation and operating results.\nWe will be subject to extensive regulation by U.S. federal and state and foreign governments in each of the markets where we intend to sell our product candidates if and after we are approved. If we fail to comply with applicable regulations, including the FDA\u2019s pre-or post-approval current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d) requirements, then the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities could sanction us. Even if a drug is FDA-approved, regulatory authorities may impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-marketing studies.\nIf a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, or disagrees with the promotion, marketing or labeling of the product, the regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency or enforcement authority may:\n\u25cf issue warning letters;\n\u25cf impose civil or criminal penalties;\n\u25cf suspend regulatory approval;\n\u25cf suspend any of our ongoing clinical trials;\n\u25cf refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications submitted by us;\n\u25cf impose restrictions on our operations, including closing our contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities; or\n\u25cf seize or detain products or require a product recall.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. Any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and generate revenue from our product candidates. If regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is withdrawn, our value and operating results will be adversely affected. Additionally, if we are unable to generate revenue from sales of our product candidates, our potential for achieving profitability will be diminished and the capital necessary to fund our operations will be increased.\nAny action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation. We expend significant resources on compliance efforts and such expenses are unpredictable and might adversely affect our results. Changing laws, regulations and standards might also create uncertainty, higher expenses and increase insurance costs.\nWe and our third-party manufacturers are, and will be, subject to regulations of the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities.\nWe and our contract manufacturers are, and will be, required to adhere to laws, regulations and guidelines of the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities setting forth current good manufacturing practices. These laws, regulations and guidelines cover all aspects of the manufacturing, testing, quality control and recordkeeping relating to our therapeutic candidates. We and our third-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with applicable laws, regulations and guidelines. We and our contract manufacturers are and will be subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA, state regulators and similar foreign regulatory authorities outside the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third party manufacturers, to comply with applicable laws, regulations and guidelines could result in the imposition of sanctions on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, refusal of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our therapeutic candidates, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of our therapeutic candidates, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect regulatory approval and supplies of our therapeutic candidates, and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approvals, our therapeutic candidates will be subject to ongoing regulatory review. If we fail to comply with continuing U.S. and applicable foreign laws, regulations and guidelines, we could lose those approvals, and our business would be seriously harmed.\nEven if our therapeutic candidates receive regulatory approval, we or our commercialization partners, as applicable, will be subject to ongoing reporting obligations, including pharmacovigilance, and the therapeutic candidates and the manufacturing operations will be subject to continuing regulatory review, including inspections by the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities. The results of this ongoing review may result in the withdrawal of a therapeutic candidate from the market, the interruption of the manufacturing operations and/or the imposition of labeling and/or marketing limitations. Since many more patients are exposed to drugs following their marketing approval, serious but infrequent adverse reactions that were not observed in clinical trials may be observed during the commercial marketing of the therapeutic candidate. In addition, the manufacturer and the manufacturing facilities that we or our commercialization partners use to produce any therapeutic candidate will be subject to periodic review and inspection by the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with any therapeutic candidate, manufacturer or manufacturing process, or failure to comply with rules and regulatory requirements, may result in actions, including but not limited to the following:\n\u25cf restrictions on such therapeutic candidate, manufacturer or manufacturing process;\n\u25cf warning letters from the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf withdrawal of the therapeutic candidate from the market;\n\u25cf suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications submitted by us or our commercial partners;\n\u25cf voluntary or mandatory recall;\n\u25cf fines;\n\u25cf refusal to permit the import or export of our therapeutic candidates;\n\u25cf product seizure or detentions;\n\u25cf injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; or\n\u25cf adverse publicity.\nIf we or our commercialization partners, suppliers, third party contractors or clinical investigators are slow to adapt, or are unable to adapt, to changes in existing regulatory requirements or the adoption of new regulatory requirements or policies, we or our commercialization partners may lose marketing approval for any of our therapeutic candidates if any of our therapeutic candidates are approved, resulting in decreased or lost revenue from milestones, product sales or royalties.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with any regulations applicable to us, to provide accurate information to regulatory authorities, to comply with manufacturing standards we may have established, to comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, or to report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risk.\nIf we fail to comply with federal or state \u201cfraud and abuse\u201d laws, the failure to comply with these laws may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the United States, we will be subject to various federal and state health care \u201cfraud and abuse\u201d laws, including anti-kickback laws, false claims laws and other laws intended to reduce fraud and abuse the healthcare industry, which could affect us, particularly upon successful commercialization of our products in the United States. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on our behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, including the purchase, order or prescription of a particular drug for which payment may be made under a federal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Under federal government regulations, some arrangements, known as safe harbors, are deemed not to violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. However, these laws are broadly written, and it is often difficult to determine precisely how the law will be applied in specific circumstances. Accordingly, it is possible that our practices may be challenged under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willfully presenting or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers, including government payers, claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services that were not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Cases have been brought under false claims laws alleging that off-label promotion of pharmaceutical products or the provision of kickbacks has resulted in the submission of false claims to governmental health care programs. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, we are prohibited from knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payers, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines, penalties and/or exclusion or suspension from federal and state health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions on behalf of the government under the federal False Claims Act as well as under the false claims laws of several states.\nMany states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for, or purchase, order or recommendation of, goods or services reimbursed by any source, not just governmental payers. The scope and enforcement of these laws are uncertain and subject to change in the current environment of healthcare reform. We cannot predict the impact on our business, financial condition nor results of operations of any changes in these laws. Any state or federal regulatory review of us, regardless of the outcome, would be costly and time-consuming. Law enforcement authorities are increasingly focused on enforcing these laws, and if we are challenged under of one of these laws, we could be required to pay a fine and/or penalty and could be suspended or excluded from participation in federal or state health care programs, and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe will be required to raise additional capital to fund our operations, and we may not be able to continue as a going concern if we are unable to do so.\nPharmaceutical product development, which includes research and development, preclinical and clinical studies and human clinical trials, is a time-consuming and expensive process that takes years to complete. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially to the extent that we advance Pulmazole to a planned new Phase 2b trial and pursue development of PUR1800 and PUR3100 or other iSPERSE-based product candidates, and/or pursue development of iSPERSE-based pharmaceuticals in additional indications. Based upon our current expectations, we believe that our existing capital resources will enable us to continue planned operations for at least 12 months following the filing date of this Annual Report. We cannot assure you, however, that our plans will not change or that changed circumstances will not result in the depletion of our capital resources more rapidly than we currently anticipate. We will need to raise additional funds, whether through the sale of equity or debt securities, the entry into strategic business collaborations, the establishment of other funding facilities, licensing arrangements, or asset sales or other means, in order to continue our research and development and clinical trial programs for our iSPERSE-based product candidates and to support our other ongoing activities. However, it may be difficult for us to raise additional funds on reasonable terms or at all. Since inception, we have incurred losses each year and have an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2020 of $234.5 million, which may raise concerns about our solvency and affect our ability to raise additional capital.\nThe amount of additional funds we need will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf rate of progress and costs of our clinical trials and research and development activities, including costs of procuring clinical materials and operating our manufacturing facilities;\n\u25cf our success in establishing strategic business collaborations or other sales or licensing of assets, and the timing and amount of any payments we might receive from any such transactions we are able to establish;\n\u25cf actions taken by the FDA and other regulatory authorities affecting our products and competitive products;\n\u25cf our degree of success in commercializing any of our product candidates;\n\u25cf the emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments;\n\u25cf the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights or defending against claims of infringement by others;\n\u25cf the level of our legal expenses; and\n\u25cf the costs of discontinuing projects and technologies.\nWe have raised capital in the past primarily through debt and public offerings and private placements of stock. We may in the future pursue the sale of additional equity and/or debt securities, or the establishment of other funding facilities including asset-based borrowings. There can be no assurances, however, that we will be able to raise additional capital through such an offering on acceptable terms, or at all. Issuances of additional debt or equity securities could impact the rights of the holders of Company Common Stock and may dilute their ownership percentage. Moreover, the establishment of other funding facilities may impose restrictions on our operations. These restrictions could include limitations on additional borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of our assets, as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens, pay dividends, redeem our stock or make investments. We also may seek to raise additional capital by pursuing opportunities for the licensing or sale of certain intellectual property and other assets. We cannot offer assurances, however, that any strategic collaborations, sales of securities or sales or licenses of assets will be available to us on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIn the event that sufficient additional funds are not obtained through strategic collaboration opportunities, sales of securities, funding facilities, licensing arrangements and/or asset sales on a timely basis, we will be required to reduce expenses through the delay, reduction or curtailment of our projects, including Pulmazole, PUR1800 or PUR3100 development activities, or reduction of costs for facilities and administration. Moreover, if we do not obtain such additional funds, there will be continued doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and increased risk of insolvency and loss of investment to the holders of our securities. If we are or become insolvent, investors in our stock may lose the entire value of their investment.\nOur long-term capital requirements are subject to numerous risks.\nOur long-term capital requirements are expected to depend on many potential factors, including, among others:\n\u25cf the number of product candidates in development;\n\u25cf the regulatory clarity and path of each of our product candidates;\n\u25cf the progress, success and cost of our clinical trials and research and development programs, including manufacturing;\n\u25cf the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review and obtaining regulatory clarity and approval of our product candidates and addressing regulatory and other issues that may arise post-approval;\n\u25cf the costs of enforcing our issued patents and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n\u25cf the costs of manufacturing, developing sales, marketing and distribution channels;\n\u25cf our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, including securing commercialization agreements with third parties and favorable pricing and market share; and\n\u25cf our consumption of available resources more rapidly than currently anticipated, resulting in the need for additional funding sooner than anticipated.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our rights to intellectual property, causing us to lose valuable rights. Loss of patent rights may lead us to lose market share and anticipated profits.\nOur success, competitive position and future revenues depend, in part, on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products, methods, processes and other technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, use or disclose proprietary technologies and processes.\nWe try to protect our proprietary position by, among other things, filing U.S., European and other patent applications related to our product candidates, methods, processes and other technologies, to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties.\nBecause the patent position of pharmaceutical companies involves complex legal and factual questions, we cannot predict the validity and enforceability of patents with certainty. Our issued patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges by third parties or could be circumvented. Our competitors may also independently develop inhaled drug delivery technologies or products similar to iSPERSE and iSPERSE-based product candidates or design around or otherwise circumvent patents issued to us. Thus, any patents that we own may not provide any protection against competitors. Our pending patent applications, those we may file in the future or those we may license from third parties may not result in patents being issued. Even if these patents are issued, they may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages. The degree of future protection to be afforded by our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage.\nPatent rights are territorial, and accordingly, the patent protection we do have will only extend to those countries in which we have issued patents. Even so, the laws of certain countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States and the European Union. Competitors may successfully challenge our patents, produce similar drugs or products that do not infringe our patents, or produce drugs in countries where we have not applied for patent protection or that do not respect our patents. Furthermore, it is not possible to know the scope of claims that will be allowed in published applications and it is also not possible to know which claims of granted patents, if any, will be deemed enforceable in a court of law.\nAfter the completion of prosecution and granting of our patents, third parties may still manufacture and/or market therapeutic candidates in infringement of our patent protected rights. Such manufacture and/or market of our product candidates in infringement of our patent protected rights is likely to cause us damage and lead to a reduction in the prices of our product candidates, thereby reducing our anticipated profits.\nIn addition, due to the extensive time needed to develop, test and obtain regulatory approval for our therapeutic candidates, any patents that protect our product candidate may expire during early stages of commercialization. This may reduce or eliminate any market advantages that such patents may give us. Following patent expiration, we may face increased competition through the entry of generic products into the market and a subsequent decline in market share and profits.\nIn addition, in some cases we may rely on our licensors to conduct patent prosecution, patent maintenance or patent defense on our behalf. Therefore, our ability to ensure that these patents are properly prosecuted, maintained, or defended may be limited, which may adversely affect our rights in our therapeutic products. Any failure by our licensors or development partners to properly conduct patent prosecution, patent maintenance or patent defense could harm our ability to obtain approval or to commercialize our products, thereby reducing our anticipated profits.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets or know-how, such proprietary information may be used by others to compete against us.\nIn addition to filing patents, we generally try to protect our trade secrets, know-how and technology by entering into confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements with parties that have access to us, such as our development and/or commercialization partners, employees, contractors and consultants. We also enter into agreements that purport to require the disclosure and assignment to us of the rights to the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions of our employees, advisors, research collaborators, contractors and consultants while employed or engaged by us. However, these agreements can be difficult and costly to enforce or may not provide adequate remedies. Any of these parties may breach the confidentiality agreements and willfully or unintentionally disclose our confidential information, or our competitors might learn of the information in some other way. The disclosure to, or independent development by, a competitor of any trade secret, know-how or other technology not protected by a patent could materially adversely affect any competitive advantage we may have over any such competitor.\nTo the extent that any of our employees, advisors, research collaborators, contractors or consultants independently develop, or use independently developed, intellectual property in connection with any of our products, disputes may arise as to the proprietary rights to this type of information. If a dispute arises with respect to any proprietary right, enforcement of our rights can be costly and unpredictable and a court may determine that the right belongs to a third party.\nLegal proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement and other challenges may require us to spend substantial time and money and could prevent us from developing or commercializing our product candidates.\nThe development, manufacture, use, offer for sale, sale or importation of our product candidates may infringe on the claims of third-party patents or other intellectual property rights. The nature of claims contained in unpublished patent filings around the world is unknown to us, and it is not possible to know which countries patent holders may choose for the extension of their filings under the Patent Cooperation Treaty or other mechanisms. We may also be subject to claims based on the actions of employees and consultants with respect to the usage or disclosure of intellectual property learned at other employers. The cost to us of any intellectual property litigation or other infringement proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively because of their substantially greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation or defense of intellectual property litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Intellectual property litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time. Consequently, we are unable to guarantee that we will be able to manufacture, use, offer for sale, sell or import our therapeutic candidates in the event of an infringement action.\nIn the event of patent infringement claims, or to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be required to seek a license from a third party and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, the rights may be non-exclusive, which could potentially limit our competitive advantage. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product candidate or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement or other claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. This inability to enter into licenses could harm our business significantly.\nWe may be subject to other patent-related litigation or proceedings that could be costly to defend and uncertain in their outcome.\nIn addition to infringement claims against us, we may in the future become a party to other patent litigation or proceedings before regulatory agencies, including interference, re-examination Inter Partes review, or post grant review proceedings filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or opposition proceedings in other foreign patent offices regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our therapeutic candidates, as well as other disputes regarding intellectual property rights with development and/or commercialization partners, or others with whom we have contractual or other business relationships. Post-issuance oppositions are not uncommon and we or our development and/or commercialization partners will be required to defend these opposition procedures as a matter of course. Opposition procedures may be costly, and there is a risk that we may not prevail, which could harm our business significantly.\nRisks Related to Company Common Stock\nThe price of Company Common Stock is subject to fluctuation and has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe stock market in general, and Nasdaq in particular, as well as biotechnology companies, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of small companies. The market price of Company Common Stock may fluctuate as a result of, among other factors:\n\u25cf the announcement of new products, new developments, services or technological innovations by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated quarterly increases or decreases in revenue, gross margin or earnings, and changes in our business, operations or prospects;\n\u25cf announcements relating to strategic relationships, mergers, acquisitions, partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures, capital commitments, or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf conditions or trends in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries;\n\u25cf changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies;\n\u25cf general market conditions or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to our performance or financial condition (including, for example, the recent coronavirus outbreak);\n\u25cf purchase or sale of Company Common Stock by stockholders, including executives and directors;\n\u25cf volatility and limitations in trading volumes of Company Common Stock;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain financings to conduct and complete research and development activities including, but not limited to, our human clinical trials, and other business activities;\n\u25cf any delays or adverse developments or perceived adverse developments with respect to the FDA\u2019s review of our planned preclinical and clinical trials;\n\u25cf ability to secure resources and the necessary personnel to conduct clinical trials on our desired schedule;\n\u25cf failures to meet external expectations or management guidance;\n\u25cf changes in our capital structure or dividend policy, future issuances of securities, sales or distributions of large blocks of Company Common Stock by stockholders;\n\u25cf our cash position;\n\u25cf announcements and events surrounding financing efforts, including debt and equity securities;\n\u25cf our inability to enter into new markets or develop new products;\n\u25cf reputational issues;\n\u25cf analyst research reports, recommendations and changes in recommendations, price targets, and withdrawals of coverage;\n\u25cf departures and additions of key personnel;\n\u25cf disputes and litigation related to intellectual property rights, proprietary rights, and contractual obligations;\n\u25cf changes in applicable laws, rules, regulations, or accounting practices and other dynamics; and\n\u25cf other events or factors, many of which may be out of our control.\nIn addition, if the market for stocks in our industry or industries related to our industry, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of Company Common Stock could fluctuate or decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management.\nFinancial reporting obligations of being a public company in the United States are expensive and time-consuming, and our management may be required to devote substantial time to compliance matters.\nAs a publicly traded company, we incur significant additional legal, accounting and other expenses. The obligations of being a public reporting company require significant expenditures, including costs resulting from public company reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and the rules and regulations regarding corporate governance practices, including those under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the Nasdaq Capital Market. These rules require the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and procedures, internal control over financial reporting and corporate governance practices, among many other complex rules that are often difficult and time consuming to implement, monitor and maintain compliance with. Moreover, despite recent reforms made possible by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), the reporting requirements, rules, and regulations will make some activities more time-consuming and costly, particularly as we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nIn addition, these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. Compliance with such requirements also places demands on management\u2019s time and attention.\nIn the foreseeable future, we do not intend to pay cash dividends on shares of Company Common Stock so any investor gains will be limited to the value of our shares.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any gains to stockholders will therefore be limited to the increase, if any, in our share price.\nWe may be at risk of securities class action litigation.\nWe may be at risk of securities class action litigation. This risk is especially relevant due to our dependence on positive clinical trial outcomes and regulatory approvals. In the past, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility, particularly when associated with binary events such as clinical trials and product approvals. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business and result in a decline in the market price of Company Common Stock.\nIn the event that we fail to satisfy any of the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market, the Company Common Stock may be delisted, which could affect our market price and liquidity.\nThe Company Common Stock is listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market. For continued listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market, we will be required to comply with the continued listing requirements, including the minimum market capitalization standard, the minimum stockholders\u2019 equity requirement, the corporate governance requirements and the minimum closing bid price requirement, among other requirements. In the event that we fail to satisfy any of the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market, the Company Common Stock may be delisted. If our securities are delisted from trading on The NASDAQ Stock Market, and we are not able to list our securities on another exchange or to have them quoted on The NASDAQ Stock Market, our securities could be quoted on the OTC Markets or on the \u201cpink sheets.\u201d As a result, we could face significant adverse consequences including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u25cf a determination that Company Common Stock is a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which would require brokers trading in Company Common Stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\u25cf a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities (including pursuant to short-form registration statements on Form S-3 or obtain additional financing in the future).\nWe are likely to issue additional equity securities in the future, which are likely to result in dilution to existing investors.\nWe may seek the additional capital necessary to fund our operations through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, and collaborative and licensing arrangements. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, including in a debt financing where we issue convertible notes or notes with warrants and any shares of Company Common Stock to be issued in a private placement, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may, from time to time, sell additional equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine. If we sell additional equity securities, existing stockholders may be materially diluted. In addition, new investors could gain rights superior to existing stockholders, such as liquidation and other preferences. In addition, the exercise or conversion of outstanding options or warrants to purchase shares of capital stock may result in dilution to our stockholders upon any such exercise or conversion.\nIn addition, as of March 19, 2021,1,902,017 shares remained available to be awarded under our 2013 Employee, Director and Consultant Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2013 Plan). Further, an aggregate of 3,893,304 shares of Company Common Stock could be delivered upon the exercise or conversion of outstanding stock options or restricted stock units under the Incentive Plan and other equity incentive plans we previously assumed. We may also issue additional options, warrants and other types of equity in the future as part of stock-based compensation, capital raising transactions, technology licenses, financings, strategic licenses or other strategic transactions. To the extent these options are exercised, existing stockholders would experience additional ownership dilution. In addition, the number of shares available for future grant under our equity compensation plans may be increased in the future, as our equity compensation plan contains an \u201cevergreen\u201d provision, pursuant to which additional shares may be authorized for issuance under the plan each year.\nAnti-takeover provisions under Delaware corporate law may make it difficult for our stockholders to replace or remove our board of directors and could deter or delay third parties from acquiring us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders.\nWe are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (the \u201cDGCL\u201d). Under these provisions, if anyone becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d we may not enter into a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with that person for three (3) years without special approval, which could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change of control. For purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL, \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d means, generally, someone owning fifteen percent (15%) or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate that owned fifteen percent (15%) or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three (3) years, subject to certain exceptions as described in Section 203 of the DGCL.\nProtective provisions in our charter and bylaws could prevent a takeover which could harm our stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain a number of provisions that could impede a takeover or prevent us from being acquired, including, but not limited to, a classified board of directors and limitations on the ability of our stockholders to remove a director from office without cause. Each of these charter and bylaw provisions give our board of directors the ability to render more difficult or costly the completion of a takeover transaction that our stockholders might view as being in their best interests.", "PERMNO": 14551, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "PULM"}
