{"cik": "1569329", "company": "Youngevity International, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-06-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk, and you should be able to bear the complete loss of your investment. You should carefully consider the risks described below and, the other information in the documents incorporated by reference herein when evaluating our Company and our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business could be harmed. In such case, the trading price of our securities could decline, and investors could lose all or a part of the money paid to buy our securities.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nThere is substantial risk about our ability to continue as a going concern, which may hinder our ability to obtain future financing. Our auditor\u2019s report on our consolidated financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 have been prepared and presented on a basis assuming we will continue as a going concern. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report that includes an explanatory paragraph referring to our recurring losses from operations (anticipated continued losses in the future) and net capital deficiency that raise substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern without additional capital becoming available. We have sustained significant losses of approximately $51,988,000 and $20,070,000 during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to lower than anticipated revenues across all our segments, impairment of goodwill and long-lived intangibles related to our commercial hemp segment, allowances for bad debt related to our commercial coffee segment and significant costs related to financing events. Net cash used in operating activities was $14,337,000 and $12,352,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Based on our current cash levels at December 31, 2019, our current rate of cash requirements, we will need to raise additional capital and we will need to increase revenues and significantly reduce our expenses from current levels to be able to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that we can raise capital upon favorable terms, if at all, or that we can significantly reduce our expenses.\nWe have a history of losses and there are no assurances we will report profitable operations in future periods.\nWe have sustained significant losses of approximately $51,988,000 and $20,070,000 during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2019, revenue from the direct selling segment and the commercial coffee segment decreased by 8.5% and 17.2%, respectively, which was partially offset by the revenue recorded from our commercial hemp segment we acquired in February 2019. In prior years, we acquired several direct selling businesses which had increased our direct selling revenue; however, during the year ended December 31, 2019, we only acquired one direct selling business. To date, we have not generated significant revenue from our commercial hemp segment and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. Until such time, if ever, that we are successful in generating significant revenue and operating profits which are sufficient to pay our expenses it is likely we will continue to report losses in future periods. There are no assurances we will generate substantial revenues from the new businesses or that we will ever generate sufficient revenues to report profitable operations or a net profit.\nWe are dependent upon access to external sources of capital to grow our business.\nOur business strategy contemplates future access to debt and equity financing to fund the expansion of our business. To date, revenue generated from operations has been insufficient to meet our working capital needs. The inability to obtain sufficient capital to fund the expansion of our business could have a material adverse effect on us. During the year ended December 31, 2019 and through the filing of this report, we raised aggregate of approximately $23,242,000 in gross proceeds from debt and equity financings. Our ability to raise capital through the sale of securities may be limited by the rules of the SEC that place limits on the number and dollar amount of securities that may be sold. We do not have any commitments from third parties for funding. A failure otherwise to raise additional funds when needed in the future could result in us being unable to complete planned operations, or forced to delay, discontinue or curtail product development, forego sales and marketing efforts, and forego licensing in attractive business opportunities. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise the funds needed on favorable terms, if at all, especially in light of the fact that we will be unable to sell securities registered on our registration statement on Form S-3 until at least June 1, 2022 and thereafter we may be further limited until such time the market value of our voting securities held by non-affiliates is $75 million or more.\nOur failure to comply with the terms of our outstanding Notes has resulted in a default under the terms of certain of the notes and, if uncured, it could potentially result in action against our pledged assets.\nWe currently have outstanding an aggregate of $10,115,000 in principal amount of outstanding Notes, which include $3,090,000 in principal amount of secured debt related to the balance of our 2019 PIPE Notes from our 2019 private placement. The 2019 PIPE Notes are secured by all of the equity we hold in KII. These PIPE Notes originally were due between February 2021 and July 2021. We have since amended 2019 PIPE Notes in the principal amount of $2,190,000 to extend due dates to between February and March 2022.\nWe have $2,000,000 in principal amount of secured debt which related to two-year secured promissory notes we issued in March 2019 which are secured by all of the equity we hold in KII. On February 18, 2021 we entered into an amendment with the holders of these promissory notes, extending the maturity date to May 18, 2022 and increasing the interest rate to 16% paid monthly until the notes are paid in full. As an inducement for the amendment to extend the maturity date, we issued each note holder 200,000 shares of our common stock. In addition, we issued one of the note holders a two-year warrant to purchase 150,000 shares of our common stock at a price per share of $1.00.\nIn March 2020, we issued a nine-month senior secured promissory notes related to our March 2020 private placement debt offering, which is secured by certain assets in CLR. On April 7, 2021, we entered into a settlement agreement with the note holder to include an agreed upon payment schedule of principal and interest payments until the note is paid in full through January 2022. In addition, as part of the settlement agreement we have issued the note holder 1,000,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nIn December 2018, CLR, entered into a credit agreement with one lender pursuant to which CLR borrowed $5,000,000 from Carl Grover and in exchange issued Mr. Grover a $5,000,000 credit note. In addition, Siles, as guarantor, executed a separate Guaranty Agreement. Stephan Wallach and Michelle Wallach, our Chief Operating Officer and Director, pledged 1,500,000 shares of our common stock held by them to secure the credit note under a security agreement with Mr. Grover. The credit note matured on December 12, 2020 and of date of this filing, remains outstanding; however, no demand for repayment has been made.\nIf we fail to comply with the terms of any of our outstanding debt, including the terms of any amendment or extension of such debt, the holders of the debt could declare a default under the notes or credit agreement and if the default were to remain uncured, and any secured creditors they would have the right to proceed against the collateral secured by the loans. Any action by secured creditors to proceed against CLR assets, KII equity or our other assets would likely have a serious disruptive effect on our business operations.\nIn connection with our preparation of our financial statements, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Until the material weaknesses are remediated, and our associated disclosure controls and procedures improve, there is a risk that a material error could occur and not be detected.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). During the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. These material weaknesses resulted in the determination that restatements to our financial statements for the quarters ended March 31, 2019, June 30, 2019, and September 30, 2019 related to revenue recognition within our commercial coffee segment are required.\nIn addition, we determined that certain fixed assets acquired in the acquisition of Khrysos Global, Inc., and the share price valuation for the common stock issued as consideration were not fairly valued as of the closing date which resulted in a decrease to the net assets acquired. These material weaknesses resulted in the determination that restatements to our financial statements for the quarters ended March 31, 2019, June 30, 2019, and September 30, 2019 related to the accounting for acquisitions within our commercial hemp segment are required.\nDuring the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2018 we identified a material weakness in that our commercial coffee segment did not have proper processes and controls in place to require sufficient documentation of significant agreements and arrangements with respect to certain operations in Nicaragua.\nThe material weaknesses we identified during the fourth quarter of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were an aggregation of the following control deficiencies commensurate with maintaining an effective control environment to absorb its most recent acquisitions and to meet the financial reporting requirements of a publicly traded company with international operations:\n\u25cf\nThe lack of appropriate software and information technology,\n\u25cf\nInformation technology control design and operating effectiveness weaknesses,\n\u25cf\nMaintaining sufficient accounting and information technology personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience, and training, required to operate within an environment highly dependent on manual controls and oversight, and\n\u25cf\nFailures in operating effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting.\nThe material weaknesses identified in 2018 and in 2019 have not yet been remediated. There can be no assurances that additional material weaknesses will not occur in the future. Until the material weaknesses are remediated, and our associated disclosure controls and procedures improve, there is a risk that a material error could occur and not be detected.\nIf we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected and we could become subject to litigation or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nOur inability to file timely and accurate periodic reports has caused us to incur significant additional costs and may continue to affect our stock price and our ability to meet listing requirements going forward.\nAs a public company, we are required to file annual and quarterly periodic reports containing the financial statements with the SEC within prescribed periods of time. We have not been able to and may continue to be unable to produce timely financial statements and file these financial statements as part of a periodic report in a timely manner with the SEC. Any or all of the foregoing could also result in the commencement of stockholder lawsuits against us. Any such litigation, as well as any proceedings that could in the future arise as a result of a filing delay and the circumstances which gave rise to it, may be time consuming and expensive, may divert management attention from the conduct of business, and could have a material adverse effect on the business, consolidated financial condition, and consolidated results of operations, and may expose us to costly indemnification obligations to current or former officers, directors, or other personnel, regardless of the outcome of such matter, which may not be adequately covered by insurance. In addition, we or members of our management could be subject to investigation and sanctions by the SEC and other regulatory authorities.\nWe also expect to continue to face many of the risks and challenges which were experienced during the recent extended filing delay periods, including:\n\u25cf\nContinued concern on the part of customers, partners, investors, and employees about the consolidated financial condition and extended filing delay status, including potential loss of business opportunities;\n\u25cf\nAdditional significant time and expense required to complete beyond the significant time and expense the Company has already incurred in connection with the accounting review to date;\n\u25cf\nContinued distraction to the senior management team and board of directors as the Company works to complete future filings;\n\u25cf\nDue to the limited capital available to the organization, the Company will continue to operate with a limited number of accounting personnel and professional resources that may continue to result in failures to timely complete filings;\n\u25cf\nLimitations on the ability to raise capital and make acquisitions;\nUncontrollable impacts of COVID-19;\n\u25cf\nThe material weaknesses identified by management continue to contribute to the delays in producing and filing the required periodic reports on a timely basis; and\n\u25cf\nGeneral harm to reputation as a result of the foregoing.\nOur inability to file timely and accurate periodic reports could result in us being in breach of certain terms of our bank loans.\nAs of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are not in compliance with the covenants under the terms of our bank loan agreement, specifically related to the delay in our filings of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 and for the quarters ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020, September 30, 2020, December 31, 2020, and March 31, 2021, however we have received a waiver of such covenants. Failure to file future reports on time or further filing delays, could result in us being in default for not providing the required quarterly financial information in a timely manner and the bank could call the loan balance due immediately.\nWe cannot assure you that our common stock and preferred stock will regain listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nOn February 2, 2021, The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC removed our common stock and 9.75% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock from listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market effective at the opening of the trading session on February 12, 2021. We had been notified of the Nasdaq staff determination to de-list its securities on September 29, 2020 and had appealed the determination to a Nasdaq Hearing Panel on October 6, 2020. On November 18, 2020, upon review of the information provided by us, the Hearing Panel determined to deny our request to remain listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market and notified us that trading in the Company securities would be suspended on November 20, 2020. The Nasdaq Listing Council did not call the matter for review and the staff determination to delist the Company became final on January 4, 2021.\nAs a result of the delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock trade on the OTC Pink market operated by OTC Markets. The delisting has depressed our stock price, substantially limit liquidity of our common stock and materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital on acceptable terms. Delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market could also continue to have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by suppliers and employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities.\nWe face risks related to the intended Restatement of our previously issued financial statements for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2019, June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2019, and being further delayed in our complying with our SEC reporting obligations if we are unable to resume a timely filing schedule.\nAs discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements under \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Report, our Audit Committee concluded that certain of our previously issued financial statements should no longer be relied upon because of certain errors in those financial statements (the \u201cRestatement\u201d).\nAs a result of the intended Restatement, our SEC reporting obligations have been delayed prior to the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we cannot assure when we will resume a timely filing schedule with respect to our future SEC reports, including our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the periods ending June 30, 2021,for which there is significant risk that we will be unable to timely file. Even after we file the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ending March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020, September 30, 2020 and March 31, 2021, and the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, we expect to continue to face many of the risks and challenges related to the Restatement, including the following:\n\u25cf\nwe may fail to remediate material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and other material weaknesses may be identified in the future, which would adversely affect the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting;\n\u25cf\nthe processes undertaken to effect the Restatement may not have been adequate to identify and correct all errors in our historical financial statements and, as a result, we may discover additional errors and our financial statements remain subject to the risk of future restatement;\n\u25cf\nour failure to have current financial information available;\n\u25cf\nthe risks associated with the failure to timely file all of our SEC reports and consequences of prior or future defaults arising under our line of credit related to our reporting obligations contained therein;\n\u25cf\nthe risk that the delay in filing our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Annual Reports on Form 10-K and any failure to satisfy other stock exchange listing requirements could cause the stock exchange to commence suspension or delisting procedures with respect to our common stock;\n\u25cf\nthe outcome of litigation and claims as well as regulatory examinations, investigations, proceedings and orders arising out of the Restatement and the failure by us to file SEC reports on a timely basis;\n\u25cf\nthe incurrence of significant Restatement-related expenses;\n\u25cf\ndiversion of management and other human resources attention from the operation of our business; and\n\u25cf\nthe possible unavailability or higher costs of financing options to fund our ongoing operations or refinance existing indebtedness resulting from the Restatement and the delayed filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ending March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020, September 30, 2020 and March 31, 2021, and the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nWe cannot assure that all of the risks and challenges described above will be eliminated and that lost business opportunities can be recaptured or that general reputational harm will not persist. If one or more of the foregoing risks or challenges persist, our business, operations and financial condition are likely to be materially and adversely affected.\nThe intended Restatement has caused substantial delays in filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020, September 30, 2020 and March 31, 2021, and the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which may result in future delays in our SEC reporting.\nOur ability to resume a timely filing schedule with respect to our SEC reports is subject to a number of contingencies, including whether we continue to identify errors in our consolidated financial statements and effective remediation of the identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, including processes and training related thereto.\nIf we become delayed again in our SEC reporting obligations, investors would need to evaluate certain decisions with respect to our securities in light of a lack of current financial information. Accordingly, if in the future we are not current in our SEC reporting obligations, any investment in our securities would involve a greater degree of risk. Any such lack of current public information may have an adverse impact on investor confidence, which could lead to a reduction in our stock price and market capitalization and an increase in our cost of capital. In addition, if we become delayed again in our SEC reporting obligations, we will be precluded from registering our securities with the SEC for offer and sale. This may preclude us from raising debt or equity financing in the public markets and limit our access to the private markets and could also limit our ability to use stock options and other equity-based awards to attract, retain and provide incentives to our employees.\nWe are not currently eligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 to register the offer and sale of securities, which may adversely affect our ability to raise future capital or complete acquisitions.\nWe are not currently eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on Form S-3 and we will not become eligible until at least June 1, 2022 assuming we timely file certain periodic reports required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 subsequent to the date hereof and prior to such date and our public float exceeds $75,000,000 or our common stock is once again listed on a national securities exchange. There can be no assurance when we will meet these requirements, which depends upon our ability to file our periodic reports on a timely basis in the future. Should we wish to register the offer and sale of our securities to the public before we are eligible to do so on Form S-3, our transaction costs and the amount of time required to complete the transaction could increase, making it more difficult to execute any such transaction successfully and potentially having an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nBecause we have recently acquired several businesses, recently entered a new line of business and significantly increased our investment in our green coffee and hemp businesses, it is difficult to predict to what extent we will be able to maintain or improve our current level of revenues and profitability.\nNo assurances can be given as to the amount of future revenue or profits that we may generate. Until recently, our business was comprised primarily of the direct sales of Youngevity\u00ae health products. In the last five years, we completed 16 business acquisitions of companies in the direct selling line of business, substantially increasing our Youngevity\u00ae health and wellness product lines. It is too early to predict whether consumers will accept, and continue to use on a regular basis, the products we added from these new acquisitions since we have had limited recent operating history as a combined entity. In addition, in February 2019 we entered into a new business segment, our commercial hemp segment, which includes field-to-finish hemp-CBD oil, isolate, and distillate market and has required devotion of both time and capital. In addition, we continue to expand our coffee business product line with the single-serve K-Cup\u00ae manufacturing capabilities and our investment in the green coffee business. It is too early to predict the results of these investments. In addition, since each acquisition involves the addition of new distributors and new products, it is difficult to assess whether initial product sales of any new product acquired will be maintained, and if sales by new distributors will be maintained.\nOur business is difficult to evaluate because we have recently expanded our business segments, product offerings and customer base.\nWe have recently expanded our operations, engaging in a new line of business in a fairly new industry as well as the sale of new products through new distributors. There is a risk that we will be unable to successfully integrate the newly acquired businesses with our current management and structure or obtain sufficient financing for this new business segment. Although we are based in California, several of the businesses we acquired are based in other places such as Utah and Florida, making the integration of our newly acquired businesses difficult. In addition, our dry-processing plant and coffee plantation is located overseas in the country of Nicaragua. and we further expanded our Nicaragua operations by entering into a construction agreement with our Siles operators to transfer a 45-acre tract of land in Matagalpa and an agreement to build a second mill to accommodate CLR\u2019s 2019 green coffee contract commitments. Our estimates of capital, personnel and equipment required for our newly acquired businesses are based on the historical experience of management and businesses they are familiar with and may not be accurate. Our management has limited direct experience in operating a business of our current size as well as one that is the hemp industry.\nOur ability to generate profit will be impacted by payments we are required to make under the terms of our acquisition agreements, the extent of which is uncertain.\nSince many of our acquisition agreements are based on future consideration, we could be obligated to make payments that exceed expectations. Many of our acquisition agreements require us to make future payments to the sellers based upon a percentage of sales of products. The fair value of the contingent acquisition debt, which requires re-measurement each reporting period, is based on our estimates of future sales and therefore is difficult to accurately predict. Profits could be adversely impacted in future periods if adjustment of the fair value of the contingent acquisition debt is required.\nThe impact of changes in the fair value of our derivative liability associated with warrant may materially impact our results of operations in future periods.\nSeveral of our warrants that we have issued require that their fair value be recorded as a derivative liability on the issuance dates. We are obligated to reassess the obligations associated with the warrants and, in the event our estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration changes, we will record increases or decreases in the fair value as an adjustment to earnings, which could have a material impact on our results of operations, our shareholders\u2019 equity and the market price of our securities. In particular, changes in the market price of our common stock, which is one of the inputs used in determining the amount of the non-cash contingent liability, will result in increases or decreases in this liability and positively or negatively impact our net loss or profit for the period. Investors should not place undue reliance on the impact of these non-cash changes when evaluating our results of operations in future periods, as they have no impact on the operations of the business. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the derivative liability are included as a component of total other expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the respective period. The changes to the derivative liability for warrants resulted in a decrease of $5,502,000 and an increase of $4,645,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe may have difficulty managing our future growth.\nSince we initiated our network marketing sales channel in fiscal 1997, our business has grown significantly. This growth has placed substantial strain on our management, operational, financial and other resources. If we are able to continue to expand our operations, we may experience periods of rapid growth, including increased resource requirements. Any such growth could place increased strain on our management, operational, financial and other resources, and we may need to train, motivate, and manage employees, as well as attract management, sales, finance and accounting, international, technical, and other professionals. Any failure to expand these areas and implement appropriate procedures and controls in an efficient manner and at a pace consistent with our business objectives could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, the financing for any of future acquisitions could dilute the interests of our stockholders, resulting in an increase in our indebtedness or both. Future acquisitions may entail numerous risks, including:\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in assimilating acquired operations or products, including the loss of key employees from acquired businesses and disruption to our direct selling channel;\n\u25cf\ndiversion of management's attention from our core business;\n\u25cf\nadverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; and\n\u25cf\nrisks of entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience.\nOur failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate acquisitions on favorable terms.\nWe generate a substantial portion of our revenue from the sale of The Beyond Tangy Tangerine line, Osteo-fx line and, Ultimate EFA line of products. A decrease in sales of these products could seriously harm our business.\nA significant portion of our revenue during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, approximately 34% and 41%, respectively, was derived from sales of our Beyond Tangy Tangerine line, Osteo-fx line and Ultimate EFA line of products. Any disruption in the supply of the raw materials used for these problems, any negative press associated with these products or manufacture and sale of competitive products, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is subject to strict government regulations.\nThe processing, formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, and distribution of our products are subject to federal laws and regulation by one or more federal agencies, including the FDA, the FTC, the CPSC, the USDA, and the EPA. These activities are also regulated by various state, local, and international laws and agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold. Government regulations may prevent or delay the introduction, result in current product being sold within those markets, to be barred from importation into those markets that may significantly decrease revenues and increase costs within, or require the reformulation, of our products, which could result in lost revenues and increased costs to us. Additionally, regulatory agencies within international markets may require the Company adhere to local market registration requirements for our products that may require reformulation, labeling and warehousing controls to be established for those products that may also significantly decrease revenues or increase costs. For instance, the FDA regulates, among other things, the composition, safety, labeling, and marketing of dietary supplements (including vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other dietary ingredients for human use). The FDA may not accept the evidence of safety for any new dietary ingredient that we may wish to market, may determine that a particular dietary supplement or ingredient presents an unacceptable health risk, and may determine that a particular claim or statement of nutritional value that we use to support the marketing of a dietary supplement is an impermissible drug claim, is not substantiated, or is an unauthorized version of a \u201chealth claim.\u201d\nAny of these actions could prevent us from marketing particular dietary supplement products or making certain claims or statements of nutritional support for them. The FDA could also require us to remove a particular product from the market. Any future recall or removal would result in additional costs to us, including lost revenues from any additional products that we are required to remove from the market, any of which could be material. Any product recalls or removals could also lead to liability, substantial costs, and reduced growth prospects. With respect to FTC matters, if the FTC has reason to believe the law is being violated (e.g. failure to possess adequate substantiation for product claims), it can initiate an enforcement action. The FTC has a variety of processes and remedies available to it for enforcement, both administratively and judicially, including compulsory process authority, cease and desist orders, and injunctions. FTC enforcement could result in orders requiring, among other things, limits on advertising, consumer redress, and divestiture of assets, rescission of contracts, or such other relief as may be deemed necessary. Violation of these orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties. Any action against us by the FTC could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products.\nAdditional or more stringent regulations of dietary supplements and other products have been considered from time to time. These developments could require reformulation of some products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of some products not able to be reformulated, additional record-keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of some products, additional or different labeling, additional scientific substantiation, adverse event reporting, or other new requirements. Any of these developments could increase our costs significantly. For example, the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act (S.3546), which was passed by Congress in December 2006, imposes significant regulatory requirements on dietary supplements including reporting of \u201cserious adverse events\u201d to the FDA and recordkeeping requirements. This legislation could raise our costs and negatively impact our business. In June 2007, the FDA adopted final regulations on GMPs in manufacturing, packaging, or holding dietary ingredients and dietary supplements, which apply to the products we manufacture and sell. These regulations require dietary supplements to be prepared, packaged, and held in compliance with certain rules. These regulations could raise our costs and negatively impact our business. Additionally, our third-party suppliers or vendors may not be able to comply with these rules without incurring substantial expenses. If our third-party suppliers or vendors are not able to timely comply with these new rules, we may experience increased cost or delays in obtaining certain raw materials and third-party products. Also, the FDA has announced that it plans to publish guidance governing the notification of new dietary ingredients. Although FDA guidance is not mandatory, it is a strong indication of the FDA\u2019s current views on the topic discussed in the guidance, including its position on enforcement.\nSee \u201cRisks Related To Our Commercial Hemp Business\u201d for a description of the regulatory risks specifically related our Hemp business.\nUnfavorable publicity could materially hurt our business.\nWe are highly dependent upon consumers\u2019 perceptions of the safety, quality, and efficacy of our products, as well as similar products distributed by other companies, including other direct selling companies. Future scientific research or publicity may not be favorable to our industry or any particular product. Because of our dependence upon consumer perceptions, adverse publicity associated with illness or other adverse effects resulting from the consumption of our product or any similar products distributed by other companies could have a material adverse impact on us. Such adverse publicity could arise even if the adverse effects associated with such products resulted from failure to consume such products as directed. Adverse publicity could also increase our product liability exposure, result in increased regulatory scrutiny and lead to the initiation of private lawsuits.\nProduct returns may adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to regulation by a variety of regulatory authorities, including the CPSC and the FDA. The failure of our third-party manufacturers to produce merchandise that adheres to our quality control standards could damage our reputation and brands and lead to customer litigation against us. If our manufacturers are unable or unwilling to recall products failing to meet our quality standards, we may be required to remove merchandise or issue voluntary or mandatory recalls of those products at a substantial cost to us. We may be unable to recover costs related to product recalls. We also may incur various expenses related to product recalls, including product warranty costs, sales returns, and product liability costs, which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. While we maintain a reserve for our product warranty costs based on certain estimates and our knowledge of current events and actions, our actual warranty costs may exceed our reserve, resulting in a need to increase our accruals for warranty costs in the future.\nIn addition, selling products for human consumption such as coffee and energy drinks involve a number of risks. We may need to recall some of our products if they become contaminated, are tampered with or are mislabeled. A widespread product recall could result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands. We also may incur significant liability if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations, or in the event our products cause injury, illness or death. In addition, we could be the target of claims that our advertising is false or deceptive under U.S. federal and state laws as well as foreign laws, including consumer protection statutes of some states. Even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful or without merit, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products could adversely affect our reputation and brand image.\nReturns are part of our business. Our return rate since the inception of selling activities has been minimal. We replace returned products damaged during shipment wholly at our cost, which historically has been negligible. Future return rates or costs associated with returns may increase. In addition, to date, product expiration dates have not played any role in product returns; however, it is possible they will increase in the future.\nA general economic downturn, a recession globally or in one or more of our geographic regions or sudden disruption in business conditions or other challenges may adversely affect our business and our access to liquidity and capital.\nA downturn in the economies in which we sell our products, including any recession in one or more of our geographic regions, or the current global macro-economic pressures or the effects of COVOD-19 on the economy, could adversely affect our business and our access to liquidity and capital. Recent global economic events over the past few years, including job losses, the tightening of credit markets and failures of financial institutions and other entities, have resulted in challenges to our business and a heightened concern regarding further deterioration globally. We could experience declines in revenues, profitability and cash flow due to reduced orders, payment delays, supply chain disruptions or other factors caused by economic or operational challenges. Any or all of these factors could potentially have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources, including our ability to issue commercial paper, raise additional capital and maintain credit lines and offshore cash balances. An adverse change in our credit ratings could result in an increase in our borrowing costs and have an adverse impact on our ability to access certain debt markets, including the commercial paper market.\nConsumer spending is also generally affected by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, energy costs, gasoline prices and consumer confidence generally, all of which are beyond our control. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, such as beauty and related products, tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower, and may impact sales of our products. Any economic downturn could result in customers having less money for discretionary purchases as a result of job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies, reduced access to credit and sharply falling home prices, among other things. A downturn in the economies in which we sell our products, including any recession in one or more of our geographic regions, or the current global macro-economic pressures or the effects of COVID-19 on the economy, could adversely affect our business and our access to liquidity and capital. Recent global economic events over the past few years, including job losses, the tightening of credit markets and failures of financial institutions and other entities, have resulted in challenges to our business and a heightened concern regarding further deterioration globally. We could experience declines in revenues, profitability and cash flow due to reduced orders, payment delays, supply chain disruptions or other factors caused by economic or operational challenges. Any or all of these factors could potentially have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources, including our ability to issue commercial paper, raise additional capital and maintain credit lines and offshore cash balances. An adverse change in our credit ratings could result in an increase in our borrowing costs and have an adverse impact on our ability to access certain debt markets, including the commercial paper market.ng other things.\nIn addition, sudden disruptions in business conditions as a result of a terrorist attack similar to the events of September 11, 2001, including further attacks, retaliation and the threat of further attacks or retaliation, war, adverse weather conditions and climate changes or other natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina and Maria, pandemic situations or large-scale power outages can have a short or, sometimes, long-term impact on consumer spending.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak, or similar global health concerns, could negatively impact our ability to source certain products, impact product pricing, impact our customers\u2019 ability or that of our licensee to obtain financing or have a negative impact on our business.\nThe COVID-19 coronavirus has spread to numerous countries, including the U.S. where we conduct a majority of our business. The impact of the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak, or similar global health concerns, has and could continue to negatively impact our ability to source certain products, impact product pricing, impact our customers' ability or that of our licensee to obtain financing or have a negative impact on our business.\nOur use of third-party suppliers for production and shipping of certain products could be negatively impacted by the regional or global outbreak of illnesses, including the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak. Any quarantines, the timing and length of containment and eradication solutions, travel restrictions, absenteeism by infected workers, labor shortages or other disruptions to our suppliers and their contract manufacturers or our customers would likely adversely impact our sales and operating results. In addition, a significant outbreak of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, including the U.S., resulting in an economic downturn that could affect the ability of our customers and licensees to obtain financing and therefore impact demand for our products. Order lead times could be extended or delayed, and pricing could increase. Some products or services may become unavailable if the regional or global spread were significant enough to prevent alternative sourcing. To date, the outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus has significantly impacted our operations, and certain of our third-party suppliers have been negatively impacted. Accordingly, we are considering alternative product sourcing in the event that product supply becomes problematic. We are unable to predict the possible future effect on our Company if COVID-19 coronavirus or another such virus continues to expand globally and throughout the U.S.\nIn addition, the outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus could disrupt our operations due to absenteeism by infected or ill members of management or other employees, or absenteeism by members of management and other employees who elect not to come to work due to the illness affecting others in our office or other workplace, or due to quarantines. COVID-19 illness could also impact members of our board of directors resulting in absenteeism from meetings of the directors or committees of directors, and making it more difficult to convene the quorums of the full board of directors or its committees needed to conduct meetings for the management of our affairs.\nThe global outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus continues to rapidly evolve. The extent to which the COVID-19 coronavirus may impact our business and clinical trials will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and social distancing in the U.S. and other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the U.S. and other countries to contain and treat the disease.\nWe face significant competition.\nWe face competition from competing products in each of our lines of business, in both the domestic and international markets. Worldwide, we compete against products sold to consumers by other direct selling and direct sales companies and through the Internet, and against products sold through the mass market and prestige retail channels. We also face increasing competition in our developing and emerging markets.\nWithin the direct selling channel, we compete on a regional and often country-by-country basis, with our direct selling competitors. There are also a number of direct selling companies that sell product lines similar to ours, some of which also have worldwide operations and compete with us globally. We compete against large and well-known companies that manufacture and sell broad product lines through various types of retail establishments. Our largest direct sales competitors are Herbalife, Amway, USANA Health Sciences and NuSkin Enterprises. In the energy drink market, we compete with companies such as Red Bull, Gatorade and Rock Star. Our beauty, skin care and cosmetic products compete with Avon and Bare Essentials. In addition, we compete against many other companies that manufacture and sell in narrower product lines sold through retail establishments. This industry is highly competitive and some of our principal competitors in the industry are larger than we are and have greater resources than we do. Competitive activities on their part could cause our sales to suffer. From time to time, we need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures or to maintain our position in the marketplace. Such pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices in response to raw material and other cost increases. Any reduction in prices as a result of competitive pressures, or any failure to increase prices when raw material costs increase, would harm profit margins and, if our sales volumes fail to grow sufficiently to offset any reduction in margins, our results of operations would suffer.\nIf our advertising, promotional, merchandising, or other marketing strategies are not successful, if we are unable to deliver new products that represent technological breakthroughs, if we do not successfully manage the timing of new product introductions or the profitability of these efforts, or if for other reasons our end customers perceive competitors' products as having greater appeal, then our sales and financial results may suffer.\nIf we do not succeed in effectively differentiating ourselves from our competitors\u2019 products, including by developing and maintaining our brands or our competitors adopt our strategies, then our competitive position may be weakened and our sales, and accordingly our profitability, may be materially adversely affected.\nWe are also subject to significant competition from other network marketing organizations for the time, attention, and commitment of new and existing distributors. Our ability to remain competitive depends, in significant part, on our success in recruiting and retaining distributors. There can be no assurance that our programs for recruiting and retaining distributors will be successful. The pool of individuals who may be interested in network marketing is limited in each market, and it is reduced to the extent other network marketing companies successfully recruit these individuals into their businesses. Although we believe we offer an attractive opportunity for distributors, there can be no assurance that other network marketing companies will not be able to recruit our existing distributors or deplete the pool of potential distributors in a given market.\nOur coffee segment also faces strong competition. The coffee industry is highly competitive, and coffee is widely distributed and readily available. Our competition will seek to create advantages in many areas including better prices, more attractive packaging, stronger marketing, more efficient production processes, speed to market, and better-quality verses value opportunities. Many of our competitors have stronger brand recognition and will reduce prices to keep our brands out of the market. Our competitors may have more automation built into their production lines allowing for more efficient production at lower costs. We compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with private label or generic products that generally are sold at lower prices. Consumers\u2019 willingness to purchase our products will depend upon our ability to maintain consumer confidence that our products are of a higher quality and provide greater value than less expensive alternatives. If the difference in quality between our brands and private label products narrows, or if there is a perception of such a narrowing, then consumers may choose not to buy our products at prices that are profitable for us.\nOur success depends, in part, on the quality and safety of our products.\nOur success depends, in part, on the quality and safety of our products, including the procedures we employ to detect the likelihood of hazard, manufacturing issues, and unforeseen product misuse. If our products are found to be, or are perceived to be, defective or unsafe, or if they otherwise fail to meet our distributors' or end customers' standards, our relationship with our distributors or end customers could suffer, we could need to recall some of our products, our reputation or the appeal of our brand could be diminished, and we could lose market share and or become subject to liability claims, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur ability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could affect our financial results.\nOur continued success depends on our ability to anticipate, gauge, and react in a timely and effective manner to changes in consumer spending patterns and preferences. We must continually work to discover and market new products, maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands, achieve a favorable mix of products, and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products. While we devote considerable effort and resources to shape, analyze, and respond to consumer preferences, consumer spending patterns and preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly. If we are unable to anticipate and respond to trends in the market for beauty and related products and changing consumer demands, our financial results will suffer.\nFurthermore, material shifts or decreases in market demand for our products, including as a result of changes in consumer spending patterns and preferences or incorrect forecasting of market demand, could result in us carrying inventory that cannot be sold at anticipated prices or increased product returns. Failure to maintain proper inventory levels or increased product returns could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, specifically patents and trademarks, our ability to compete could be negatively impacted.\nMost of our products are not protected by patents. The labeling regulations governing our nutritional supplements require that the ingredients of such products be precisely and accurately indicated on product containers. Accordingly, patent protection for nutritional supplements often is impractical given the large number of manufacturers who produce nutritional supplements having many active ingredients in common. Additionally, the nutritional supplement industry is characterized by rapid change and frequent reformulations of products, as the body of scientific research and literature refines current understanding of the application and efficacy of certain substances and the interactions among various substances. In this respect, we maintain an active research and development program that is devoted to developing better, purer, and more effective formulations of our products. We protect our investment in research, as well as the techniques we use to improve the purity and effectiveness of our products, by relying on trade secret laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our trade secrets and trademarks will be successful. We intend to maintain and keep current all of our trademark registrations and to pay all applicable renewal fees as they become due. The right of a trademark owner to use its trademarks, however, is based on a number of factors, including their first use in commerce, and trademark owners can lose trademark rights despite trademark registration and payment of renewal fees. We therefore believe that these proprietary rights have been and will continue to be important in enabling us to compete and if for any reason we were unable to maintain our trademarks, our sales of the related products bearing such trademarks could be materially and negatively affected. Nor can there be any assurance that third parties will not assert claims against us for infringement of their intellectual proprietary rights. If an infringement claim is asserted, we may be required to obtain a license of such rights, pay royalties on a retrospective or prospective basis, or terminate our manufacturing and marketing of our infringing products. Litigation with respect to such matters could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and other resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nWe consider our roasting methods essential to the flavor and richness of our coffee and, therefore, essential to our various brands. Because our roasting methods cannot be patented, we would be unable to prevent competitors from copying our roasting methods, if such methods became known. If our competitors copy our roasting methods, the value of our brands could be diminished, and we could lose customers to our competitors. In addition, competitors could develop roasting methods that are more advanced than ours, which could also harm our competitive position.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets represent significant assets on our balance sheet, and we may experience further impairments.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a loss on impairment of goodwill of $6,831,000 which represented the full amount of goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition of Khrysos Global in February 2019. The impairment was driven by a decline in the estimated fair value primarily due to the reduction in the profitability forecasts, as well as increased working capital requirements which increased the commercial hemp segment\u2019s carrying value. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we also recorded a loss on impairment of intangible assets related to the Khrysos acquisition of $8,461,000. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a loss on impairment of intangible assets related to our acquisitions of BeautiControl, Inc. and Future Global Vision, Inc. and recorded a loss on impairment of intangible assets of approximately $2,550,000 and $625,000, respectively. While these charges had no impact on our business operations, cash balances or operating cash flows, they resulted in significant losses during the reporting periods.\nIf we experience additional impairments in our goodwill, or if our other intangible assets become impaired, then we will be required to take further non-cash charges against earnings. Since goodwill impairment calculations are based on estimates, including external factors that are outside of our control such as our stock price and future market and economic conditions, it is possible that we may need to take additional goodwill impairment charges in the future. We also perform an analysis of our intangible assets to test for impairment whenever events occur that indicate impairment could exist. Examples of such events include: significant adverse changes in the intangible asset\u2019s market value, useful life, or in the business climate that could affect its value; a current-period operating or cash flow loss or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of the intangible asset; and a current expectation that, more likely than not, the intangible asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life.\nWe may become involved in the future in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are a party to litigation at the present time and may become party to litigation in the future. In general, litigation claims can be expensive, and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could significantly affect financial results. However, it is not possible to predict the final resolution of any litigation to which we are, or may be party to, and the impact of certain of these matters on our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be material.\nGovernment reviews, inquiries, investigations, and actions could harm our business or reputation.\nAs we operate in various locations around the world, our operations in certain countries are subject to significant governmental scrutiny and may be harmed by the results of such scrutiny. The regulatory environment with regard to direct selling in emerging and developing markets where we do business is evolving and officials in such locations often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply applicable regulations. In addition, our coffee operations are subject to Nicaraguan regulations. The regulatory environment with regard to our hemp segment is still uncertain and evolving. From time to time, we may receive formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities about our business and compliance with local laws and regulations. Any determination that our operations or activities or the activities of our distributors, are not in compliance with existing laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits, or similar results, all of which could potentially harm our business and or reputation. Even if an inquiry does not result in these types of determinations, it potentially could create negative publicity which could harm our business and or reputation.\nThe loss of key management personnel could adversely affect our business.\nOur founder, Dr. Joel Wallach, is a highly visible spokesman for our products and our direct selling business, and our message is based in large part on his vision and reputation, which helps distinguish us from our competitors. Any loss or limitation on Dr. Wallach as a lead spokesman for our mission, business, and products could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, our executive officers, including Stephan Wallach and David Briskie, are primarily responsible for our day-to-day operations, with our coffee operations and hemp operations significantly dependent upon the services of David Briskie, and we believe our success depends in part on our ability to retain our executive officers, to compensate our executive officers at attractive levels, and to continue to attract additional qualified individuals to our management team. We cannot guarantee continued service by our key executive officers. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers. The loss or limitation of the services of any of our executive officers or the inability to attract additional qualified management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials for products at favorable prices, or at all, or the inability to obtain certain products from third-party suppliers or from our manufacturers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe contract with third-party manufacturers and suppliers for the production of some of our products, including most of our powdered drink mixes and nutrition bars, and certain of our personal care products. These third-party suppliers and manufacturers produce and, in most cases, package these products according to formulations that have been developed by, or in conjunction with, our in-house product development team. There is a risk that any of our suppliers or manufacturers could discontinue manufacturing our products or selling their products to us. Although we believe that we could establish alternate sources for most of our products, any delay in locating and establishing relationships with other sources could result in product shortages or back orders for products, with a resulting loss of net sales. In certain situations, we may be required to alter our products or to substitute different products from another source. We have, in the past, discontinued or temporarily stopped sales of certain products that were manufactured by third parties while those products were on back order. There can be no assurance that suppliers will provide the raw materials or manufactured products that are needed by us in the quantities that we request or at the prices that we are willing to pay. Because we do not control the actual production of certain raw materials and products, we are also subject to delays caused by any interruption in the production of these materials, based on conditions not within our control, including weather, crop conditions, transportation interruptions, strikes by supplier employees, and natural disasters or other catastrophic events.\nShortages of raw materials may temporarily adversely affect our margins or our profitability related to the sale of those products.\nWe may experience temporary shortages of the raw materials used in certain of our nutritional products. While we periodically experience price increases due to unexpected raw material shortages and other unanticipated events, this has historically not resulted in a material effect on our overall cost of goods sold. However, there is no assurance that our raw materials will not be significantly adversely affected in the future, causing our profitability to be reduced. A deterioration of our relationship with any of our suppliers, or problems experienced by these suppliers, could lead to inventory shortages. In such case, we may not be able to fulfill the demand of existing customers, supply new customers, or expand other channels of distribution. A raw material shortage could result in decreased revenue or could impair our ability to maintain or expand our business. With respect to our green coffee, we obtain a significant portion of our unprocessed coffee beans from local farmers in Nicaragua through their agent and we are dependent upon such farmers for the supply of our product. Any decrease in supply of unprocessed beans from such farmers either related to weather or competitors, could adversely impact our business.\nA failure of our information technology systems would harm our business.\nThe global nature of our business and our seamless global compensation plan requires the development and implementation of robust and efficiently functioning information technology systems. Such systems are vulnerable to a variety of potential risks, including damage or interruption resulting from natural disasters, telecommunication failures, and human error or intentional acts of sabotage, vandalism, break-ins and similar acts. Although we have adopted and implemented a business continuity and disaster recovery plan, which includes routine back-up, off-site archiving and storage, and certain redundancies, the occurrence of any of these events could result in costly interruptions or failures adversely affecting our business and the results of our operations.\nOur business is subject to online security risks, including security breaches.\nOur businesses involve the storage and transmission of users\u2019 proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. An increasing number of websites, including several large companies, have recently disclosed breaches of their security, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their sites. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. A party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our or our customers\u2019 proprietary information, cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our customers, or otherwise damage our reputation and business. Any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business.\nCurrently, a significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for all transaction fees charged by us. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication to effectively secure transmission of confidential information, including customer credit card numbers. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction data being breached or compromised. Non-technical means, for example, actions by a suborned employee, can also result in a data breach.\nUnder payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. In addition, if we fail to follow payment card industry security standards, even if there is no compromise of customer information, we could incur significant fines or lose our ability to give customers the option of using payment cards to fund their payments or pay their fees. If we were unable to accept payment cards, our business would be seriously damaged.\nOur servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, \u201cdenial-of-service\u201d type attacks and similar disruptions that could, in certain instances, make all or portions of our websites unavailable for periods of time. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. These issues are likely to become more difficult as we expand the number of places where we operate. Security breaches, including any breach by us or by parties with which we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of our users\u2019 personal information, could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. Our insurance policies carry coverage limits, which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches.\nOur web customers, as well as those of other prominent companies, may be targeted by parties using fraudulent \u201cspoof\u201d and \u201cphishing\u201d emails to misappropriate passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware programs to our customers\u2019 computers. These emails appear to be legitimate emails sent by our Company, but they may direct recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the email or request that the recipient send a password or other confidential information via email or download a program. Despite our efforts to mitigate \u201cspoof\u201d and \u201cphishing\u201d emails through product improvements and user education, \u201cspoof\u201d and \u201cphishing\u201d remain a serious problem that may damage our brands, discourage use of our websites, and increase our costs.\nOur ability to conduct business in international markets may be affected by political, legal, tax and regulatory risks.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, approximately 15% and 14%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from sales outside the U.S. Our green coffee business in based in Nicaragua. We own one plantation and intend to purchase another in Nicaragua. We anticipate increasing our operations in Nicaragua and in 2019 further expanded our Nicaragua operations by entering into a construction agreement with our Siles operators to purchase a 45-acre tract of land in Matagalpa and an agreement to build a second mill to accommodate CLR\u2019s 2020 green coffee contract commitments. Additionally, on April 20 and July 29, 2020, CLR and KII (the U.S. Partners) entered into agreements (\u201cHemp Joint Venture Agreement\u201d) with H&H Export and Fitracomex, Inc. (\u201cFitracomex\u201d) (collectively \u201cThe Nicaraguan Partners\u201d) and established the hemp joint venture (the \u201cNicaraguan Hemp Grow and Extractions Group\u201d or the \u201cHemp Joint Venture\u201d). Our ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets and to maintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets is exposed to the risks associated with international operations, including:\n\u25cf\nthe possibility that local civil unrest, political instability or changes in diplomatic or trade relationships might disrupt our operations in an international market;\n\u25cf\nthe lack of well-established or reliable legal systems in certain areas;\n\u25cf\nthe presence of high inflation in the economies of international markets;\n\u25cf\nthe possibility that a foreign government authority might impose legal, tax or other financial burdens on us or our coffee operations, or sales force, due, for example, to the structure of our operations in various markets;\n\u25cf\nthe possibility that a government authority might challenge the status of our sales force as independent contractors or impose employment or social taxes on our sales force; and\n\u25cf\nthe possibility that governments may impose currency remittance restrictions limiting our ability to repatriate cash.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could reduce our overall profits.\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, certain financial information is required to be translated from foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar using either the spot rate or the weighted-average exchange rate. If the U.S. dollar changes relative to applicable local currencies, there is a risk our reported sales, operating expenses, and net income could significantly fluctuate. We are not able to predict the degree of exchange rate fluctuations, nor can we estimate the effect any future fluctuations may have upon our future operations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging contracts or participated in any hedging or derivative activities.\nTaxation and transfer pricing affect our operations and we could be subjected to additional taxes, duties, interest, and penalties in material amounts, which could harm our business.\nAs a multinational corporation, in several countries, including the U.S., we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations designed to ensure that our intercompany transactions are consummated at prices that have not been manipulated to produce a desired tax result, that appropriate levels of income are reported as earned by the local entities, and that we are taxed appropriately on such transactions. Regulators closely monitor our corporate structure, intercompany transactions, and how we effectuate intercompany fund transfers. If regulators challenge our corporate structure, transfer pricing methodologies or intercompany transfers, our operations may be harmed and our effective tax rate may increase.\nA change in applicable tax laws or regulations or their interpretation could result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings and such change could be significant to our financial results. In the event any audit or assessments are concluded adversely to us, these matters could have a material impact on our financial condition.\nNon-compliance with anti-corruption laws could harm our business.\nOur international operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d). Any allegations that we are not in compliance with anti-corruption laws may require us to dedicate time and resources to an internal investigation of the allegations or may result in a government investigation. Any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with existing anti-corruption laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, and other penalties. Although we have implemented anti-corruption policies, controls and training globally to protect against violation of these laws, we cannot be certain that these efforts will be effective. We are aware that one of our direct marketing competitors is under investigation in the U.S. for allegations that its employees violated the FCPA in China and other markets. If this investigation causes adverse publicity or increased scrutiny of our industry, our business could be harmed.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR DIRECT SELLING BUSINESS\nIndependent distributor activities that violate laws could result in governmental actions against us and could otherwise harm our business.\nOur independent distributors are independent contractors. They are not employees and they act independently of us. The network marketing industry is subject to governmental regulation. We implement strict policies and procedures to try to ensure that our independent distributors comply with laws. Any determination by the FTC or other governmental agency that we or our distributors are not in compliance with laws could potentially harm our business. Even if governmental actions do not result in rulings or orders against us, they could create negative publicity that could detrimentally affect our efforts to recruit or motivate independent distributors and attract customers.\nNetwork marketing is heavily regulated and subject to government scrutiny and regulation, which adds to the expense of doing business and the possibility that changes in the law might adversely affect our ability to sell some of our products in certain markets.\nNetwork marketing systems, such as ours, are frequently subject to laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and internationally, that are directed at ensuring that product sales are made to consumers of the products and that compensation, recognition, and advancement within the marketing organization are based on the sale of products rather than on investment in the sponsoring company. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes, often referred to as \u201cpyramid\u201d schemes, which compensate participants for recruiting additional participants irrespective of product sales, use high pressure recruiting methods and or do not involve legitimate products. Complying with these rules and regulations can be difficult and requires the devotion of significant resources on our part. Regulatory authorities, in one or more of our present or future markets, could determine that our network marketing system does not comply with these laws and regulations or that it is prohibited. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations or such a prohibition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Further, we may simply be prohibited from distributing products through a network-marketing channel in some countries, or we may be forced to alter our compensation plan.\nWe are also subject to the risk that new laws or regulations might be implemented or that current laws or regulations might change, which could require us to change or modify the way we conduct our business in certain markets. This could be particularly detrimental to us if we had to change or modify the way we conduct business in markets that represent a significant percentage of our net sales.\nOur principal business segment is conducted worldwide in one channel, direct selling and therefore any negative perceptive of direct selling would greatly impact our sales.\nOur principal business segment is conducted worldwide in the direct selling channel. Sales are made to the ultimate consumer principally through independent distributors and customers worldwide. There is a high rate of turnover among distributors, which is a common characteristic of the direct selling business. As a result, in order to maintain our business and grow our business in the future, we need to recruit, retain and service distributors on a continuing basis and continue to innovate the direct selling model. Consumer purchasing habits, including reducing purchases of products generally, or reducing purchases from distributors or buying products in channels other than in direct selling, such as retail, could reduce our sales, impact our ability to execute our global business strategy or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If our competitors establish greater market share in the direct selling channel, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected. Furthermore, if any government bans or severely restricts our business method of direct selling, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to attract and retain distributors and to sustain and enhance sales through our distributors can be affected by adverse publicity or negative public perception regarding our industry, our competition, or our business generally. Negative public perception may include negative publicity regarding the sales structure of significant, pure network marketing companies which has been the case recently with large network marketing companies, the quality or efficacy of nutritional supplement products or ingredients in general or our products or ingredients specifically, and regulatory investigations, regardless of whether those investigations involve us or our distributors or the business practices or products of our competitors or other network marketing companies. Any adverse publicity may also adversely impact the market price of our stock and cause insecurity among our distributors. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to adverse publicity or negative public perception in the future or that such adverse publicity will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nAs a network marketing company, we are dependent upon an independent sales force and we do not have direct control over the marketing of our products.\nWe rely on non-employee, independent distributors to market and sell our products and to generate our sales. Distributors typically market and sell our products on a part-time basis and likely will engage in other business activities, some of which may compete with us. We have a large number of distributors and a relatively small corporate staff to implement our marketing programs and to provide motivational support to our distributors. We rely primarily upon our distributors to attract, train and motivate new distributors. Our sales are directly dependent upon the efforts of our distributors. Our ability to maintain and increase sales in the future will depend in large part upon our success in increasing the number of new distributors, retaining and motivating our existing distributors, and in improving the productivity of our distributors.\nWe can provide no assurances that the number of distributors will increase or remain constant or that their productivity will increase. Our distributors may terminate their services at any time, and, like most direct selling companies, we experience a high turnover among new distributors from year-to-year. We cannot accurately predict any fluctuation in the number and productivity of distributors because we primarily rely upon existing distributors to sponsor and train new distributors and to motivate new and existing distributors. Our operating results in other markets could also be adversely affected if we and our existing distributors do not generate sufficient interest in our business to successfully retain existing distributors and attract new distributors.\nThe loss of a significant Youngevity distributor could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on the successful efforts of our distributors that become leaders. If these downline distributors in turn sponsor new distributors, additional business centers are created, with the new downline distributors becoming part of the original sponsoring distributor\u2019s downline network. As a result of this network marketing system, distributors develop business relationships with other distributors. The loss of a key distributor or group of distributors, large turnover or decreases in the size of the key distributors force, seasonal or other decreases in purchase volume, sales volume reduction, the costs associated with training new distributors, and other related expenses may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Moreover, our ability to continue to attract and retain distributors can be affected by a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u25cf\nGeneral business and economic conditions;\n\u25cf\nAdverse publicity or negative misinformation about us or our products;\n\u25cf\nPublic perceptions about network marketing programs;\n\u25cf\nHigh-visibility investigations or legal proceedings against network marketing companies by federal or state authorities or private citizens;\n\u25cf\nPublic perceptions about the value and efficacy of nutritional, personal care, or weight management products generally;\n\u25cf\nOther competing network marketing organizations entering into the marketplace that may recruit our existing distributors or reduce the potential pool of new distributors; and\n\u25cf\nChanges to our compensation plan required by law or implemented for business reasons that make attracting and retaining distributors more difficult.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain distributors in sufficient numbers to sustain future growth or to maintain our present growth levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nNutritional supplement products may be supported by only limited availability of conclusive clinical studies.\nSome of our products include nutritional supplements that are made from vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other substances for which there is a long history of human consumption. Other products contain innovative ingredients or combinations of ingredients. Although we believe that all of our products are safe when taken as directed, there is little long-term experience with human consumption of certain of these product ingredients or combinations of ingredients in concentrated form. We conduct research and test the formulation and production of our products, but we have performed or sponsored only limited clinical studies. Furthermore, because we are highly dependent on consumers' perception of the efficacy, safety, and quality of our products, as well as similar products distributed by other companies, we could be adversely affected in the event that those products prove or are asserted to be ineffective or harmful to consumers or in the event of adverse publicity associated with any illness or other adverse effects resulting from consumers' use or misuse of our products or similar products of our competitors.\nOur manufacturers are subject to certain risks.\nWe are dependent upon the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our manufacturers and suppliers of products. Those operations are subject to power failures, the breakdown, failure, or substandard performance of equipment, the improper installation or operation of equipment, natural or other disasters, and the need to comply with the requirements or directives of government agencies, including the FDA. There can be no assurance that the occurrence of these or any other operational problems at our facilities would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nChallenges by private parties to the direct selling system could harm our business.\nDirect selling companies have historically been subject to legal challenges regarding their method of operation or other elements of their business by private parties, including their own representatives, in individual lawsuits and through class actions, including lawsuits claiming the operation of illegal pyramid schemes that reward recruiting over sales. We can provide no assurance that we would not be harmed if any such actions were brought against any of our current subsidiaries or any other direct selling company we may acquire in the future.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMERCIAL COFFEE BUSINESS\nIncreases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nWe purchase, roast, and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products. The price of coffee is subject to significant volatility. The high-quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the \u201cC\u201d price. This premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. An increase in the \u201cC\u201d coffee commodity price does increase the price of high-quality arabica coffee and also impacts our ability to enter into fixed-price purchase commitments. We frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the base \u201cC\u201d coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established.\nThese are known as price-to-be-fixed contracts. We also enter into supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, and price are fixed. The supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, including weather, natural disasters, crop disease, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels, and political and economic conditions, as well as the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. Speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. Because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices, increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans could have an adverse impact on our profitability. In addition, if we are not able to purchase or receive assignments in sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have an adverse impact on our profitability.\nAdverse public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming our products, as well as reports of incidents involving food-borne illnesses, food tampering, or food contamination, whether or not accurate, could harm our business.\nSome of our products contain caffeine and other active compounds, the health effects of which are the subject of public scrutiny, including the suggestion that excessive consumption of caffeine and other active compounds can lead to a variety of adverse health effects. In the U.S., there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, due in part to increased publicity and attention from health organizations, as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food products, frequently including caffeine. An unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products, or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our products.\nSimilarly, instances or reports, whether true or not, of food-borne illnesses, food tampering and food contamination, either during manufacturing, packaging or preparation, have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food processing, grocery and quick-service restaurant sectors and could affect us as well. Any report linking us to the use of food tampering or food contamination could damage our brand value, severely hurt sales of our products, and possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions) or damages. If consumers become ill from food-borne illnesses, tampering or contamination, we could also be forced to temporarily stop selling our products and consequently could materially harm our business and results of operations.\nBecause our green coffee operations are concentrated within Nicaragua, we are subject to greater risks than if our green coffee business was internationally diversified.\nDue to the fact that our green coffee operations are concentrated within Nicaragua, we are subject to greater risks than a company with coffee operations that are more geographically and internationally diversified. Political or financial instability, currency fluctuations, trade restrictions, the outbreak of pandemics, labor unrest, transport capacity and costs, port security, weather conditions, natural disasters or other events in Nicaragua could slow or disrupt our coffee operations, disrupt our supply of our green coffee and/or adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon H&H Coffee Group Export Corp., our largest customer of our green coffee mill processing services for the year ended December 31, 2019, and Hernandez, Hernandez Export Y Compania Limitada to supply and assign unprocessed green coffee to our mill for processing, as well as the provision of management services to our Nicaraguan subsidiary.\nH&H is an agent of the local producers in Nicaragua and they supply and assign unprocessed green coffee to our mill for processing. We do not have a direct relationship with the local producers and are dependent on H&H, to negotiate agreements with local producers and assign raw green coffee to us in a timely and efficient manner for processing at our mill. During the year ended December 31, 2019, all of the unprocessed green coffee that was assigned to our mill for processing was supplied to us by H&H. In addition, H&H Coffee Group Export was our largest customer for our mill processing services of green coffee beans during the year ended December 31, 2019. The owners of H&H and H&H Export have been engaged by CLR as employees to manage Siles and we have a profit-sharing agreement with them in regard to profits from green coffee sales and processing with respect to profit generated from the sale of processed green coffee from La Pita, a leased mill, or the new Matagalpa Mill. In addition, an affiliated entity of H&H Export owns 50% of the Matagalpa Property and has agreed to contribute $4,700,000 toward construction of the Matagalpa Mill on the property for processing coffee in Nicaragua.\nWe have also collaborated with H&H, our green coffee supplier and H&H Export, and other third parties in Nicaragua to develop a sourcing solution by entering into the Finance, Security and Accounts Receivable/Accounts Payable Monetization Agreement (the \u201cFSRP Agreement\u201d.) The FSRP Agreement is designed to provide us with access to a continued supply of green coffee beans for the 2020 growing season and a solution for funding of the continued operations of our raw green coffee distribution business. Under the FSRP Agreement, management has assessed the collectability of accounts receivable from H&H Export and believes collectability is more than likely due to the contracted FSRP Agreement, our history with H&H Export and our continual communication about future contractual agreements. During the FSRP Agreement negotiations any repayment or settlement of the accounts receivable balances related to green coffee sales were stayed.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, CLR recorded revenues from mill processing services of approximately $6,416,000 and during the year ended December 31, 2018 CLR recorded the sale of processed green coffee beans and recorded green coffee sales revenue of approximately $3,938,000, to H&H Export. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, CLR's accounts receivable balance for customer related revenue to be derived from sales to H&H Export were $8,707,000 and $673,000, respectively, of which the full amount was past due at December 31, 2019, as a result, CLR has reserved $7,871,000 as bad debt related to this accounts receivable which is net of collections through December 31, 2020.\nIn March 2021, CLR entered into a Master Relationship Agreement (\u201cMA Agreement\u201d) with the owners of H&H in order to memorialize the various agreement and modifications to those agreements in order to memorialize each of those agreements. Additionally, certain events have occurred that have kept the parties from complying with the terms of each of the original agreements and have caused there to be an imbalance with the respect to the funds owed from one party to the other; therefore this MA Agreement also sets forth a detailed accounting of the different business relationships and reconciles the monetary obligations between each party through the end of fiscal year 2020. Failure of the agreed-up terms contained within the MRA by H&H and their financial ability to meet their commercial debts, and loan obligations could have a material impact on the financial results for our commercial coffee segment.\nInterruptions in our supply chain of green coffee or changes in our relationships with our vendors could adversely affect our gross margins, expenses, and results of operations.\nAll of our coffee is sourced, directly or indirectly, from outside the U.S., and primarily from Nicaragua. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, approximately 38.2% and 52.1%, respectively, of our coffee segment revenue was derived from mill processing services of green coffee and the sale of green coffee, for which all of the green coffee used within these revenue streams was procured in Nicaragua. We do not grow the green coffee that we mill, process and sell and instead the green coffee that we mill, process and sell originates with local producers in Nicaragua. During the year ended December 31, 2018, all our green coffee was procured from one vendor, H&H, as the agent of the local producers in Nicaragua. We did not procure any green coffee from H&H, for the year ended December 31, 2019. We do not have a direct relationship with the local producers and are dependent on this vendor to negotiate agreements with local producers for the supply of green coffee to our mill in a timely and efficient manner.\nIn January 2019, to accommodate CLR\u2019s green coffee purchase contract, CLR entered into an agreement with the Nicaraguan Partner, pursuant to which the Nicaraguan Partner agreed to transfer a 45-acre tract of land in Matagalpa, Nicaragua to be owned 50% by the Nicaraguan Partner and 50% by CLR. In consideration for the land acquisition we issued to H&H Export, 153,846 shares of our common stock. The fair value of the shares issued was $1,200,000 and was based on the stock price on the date of issuance of the shares. In addition, the Nicaraguan Partner and CLR agreed to contribute $4,700,000 each toward construction of a processing plant, office, and storage facilities on the Matagalpa Property for processing coffee in Nicaragua. As of the date of this filing, the Matagalpa Mill project is still incomplete for total operations. If our fulfillment network does not operate properly or if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments, whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons, we could experience delivery delays or an inability to meet required commitments which could adversely affect our gross margins, expenses and results of operations.\nOur estimates of revenue derived from the sale of green coffee have been based upon revenue recognition policies that have changed and have resulted in decreased revenue recognition in 2019.\nDuring the first three quarters of the year ended December 31, 2019, all of the revenue derived from our sale of processed green coffee to H&H Export was initially recognized as green coffee sales revenue, on a gross basis, without giving effect to deductions for expenses directly attributed to the procurement and processing of such green coffee. On October 12, 2020, our Audit Committee determined that our financial statements for the quarters ended March 31, 2019, June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2019 could no longer be relied upon and were restated to reflect revenue from mill processing of green coffee for H&H Export on a net basis. This change resulted in a substantial decrease in revenue and cost of revenue reported in our financial statements for such quarters despite having no material impact on our net income/loss.\nA significant portion of our commercial coffee segment revenue and purchases for the year ended December 31, 2019 has been generated from sales from few customers and for the year ended December 31, 2018 has been generated from sales from a few customers and suppliers.\nThe agent that represents the producers that assigns green coffee for processing at our mill, H&H, is related to our largest customer of our mill processing of green coffee, H&H Export. The termination of our relationship with either H&H Export or Rothfos Corporation would adversely affect our business. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our commercial coffee segment had three customers, H&H Export, Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. and Topco Associates, LLC, that individually comprised more than 10% of our commercial coffee segment revenue and in the aggregate approximated 54% of total segment revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our commercial coffee segment had two customers, H&H Export and Rothfos Corporation that individually comprised more than 10% of our commercial coffee segment revenue and in the aggregate approximated 49% of total segment revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded revenues from green coffee milling and processing services of approximately $6,416,000 that approximated 33% of commercial coffee segment revenue from H&H Export. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded revenue from the sale of processed green coffee beans of $3,938,000 that approximated 17% of commercial coffee segment revenue from H&H Export.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the commercial coffee segment primarily made purchases of processed green coffee beans from four vendors, INTL FC Stone Merchant Services, Rothfos Corporation, Sixto Packaging and the Serengeti Trading Co., that individually comprised more than 10% of total segment purchases and in aggregate approximated 73% of our total segment purchases. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the commercial coffee segment made purchases of processed green coffee beans from two vendors, H&H and Rothfos Corporation, which individually comprised more than 10% of total segment purchases and in aggregate approximated 83% of total segment purchases.\nCLR made purchases from H&H Export of processed green coffee for the year ended December 31, 2018, that approximated 45%, of total coffee segment purchases for use in selling processed green coffee to other third parties and for use in CLR\u2019s Miami roasting facilities. CLR did not have any purchases of processed green coffee from H&H Export during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMERCIAL HEMP BUSINESS\nUncertainty caused by potential changes to legal regulations could impact the use of CBD products.\nThere is substantial uncertainty and different interpretations among federal, state, and local regulatory agencies, legislators, academics and businesses as to the scope of operation of Farm Bill-compliant hemp programs relative to the emerging regulation of cannabinoids. These different opinions include, but are not limited to, the regulation of cannabinoids by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, and/or the FDA and the extent to which manufacturers of products containing Farm Bill-compliant cultivators and processors may engage in interstate commerce. The uncertainties cannot be resolved without further federal, and perhaps even state-level, legislation, regulation or a definitive judicial interpretation of existing legislation and rules. If these uncertainties continue, they may have an adverse effect upon the introduction of our products in different markets.\nChanges to state laws pertaining to industrial hemp could slow the use of industrial hemp which would materially impact our revenues in future periods.\nAs of the date hereof, approximately 48 states authorized industrial hemp programs pursuant to the Farm Bill. Continued development of the industrial hemp industry will be dependent upon new legislative authorization of industrial hemp at the state level, and further amendment or supplementation of legislation at the federal level. Any number of events or occurrences could slow or halt progress all together in this space. While progress within the industrial hemp industry is currently encouraging, growth is not assured. While there appears to be ample public support for favorable legislative action, numerous factors may impact or negatively affect the legislative process(es) within the various states where we have business interests. Any one of these factors could slow or halt use of industrial hemp, which could negatively impact the business up to possibly causing us to discontinue operations as a whole.\nNew legislation or regulations which impose substantial new regulatory requirements on the manufacture, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution and sale of hemp-derived products could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded revenue of $887,000 related to our commercial hemp segment. We believe that the sale of our hemp-derived products are in compliance with all applicable regulations since all of our hemp products contain less than 0.3% THC and are sold only in states in the U.S. that have not prohibited the sale of hemp products. The rapidly changing regulatory landscape regarding hemp-derived products presents a substantial risk to the success and ongoing viability of the hemp industry in general and our ability to offer and market hemp-derived products. New legislation or regulations may be introduced at either the federal and/or state level which, if passed, could impose substantial new regulatory requirements on the manufacture, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution and sale of hemp-derived products, such as our Hemp FX\u2122 CBD oil products. New legislation or regulations may also require the reformulation, elimination or relabeling of certain products to meet new standards and revisions to certain sales and marketing materials, and it is possible that the costs of complying with these new regulatory requirements could be material.\n\u201cMarijuana\u201d is illegal under the federal Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d). The 2018 Farm Bill modified the definition of \u201cmarijuana\u201d in the CSA so that the definition of \u201cmarijuana\u201d no longer includes hemp. The 2018 Farm Bill defines hemp as the \u201cplant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis.\u201d All of our hemp-derived products contain less than 0.3% delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration content. As such, we believe that the manufacture, packaging, labeling, advertising, distribution and sale of our hemp-derived products do not violate the CSA. If federal or state regulatory authorities, however, were to determine that industrial hemp and derivatives could be treated by federal and state regulatory authorities as \u201cmarijuana\u201d, we could no longer offer our Hemp FX\u2122 CBD oil products legally and could potentially be subject to regulatory action. Although we are unaware of any enforcement actions to date against the sale of hemp-related products, any enforcement action could be detrimental to our business. Violations of U.S. federal laws and regulations could result in significant fines, penalties, administrative sanctions, convictions or settlements arising from civil proceedings conducted by the U.S. federal government including but not limited to disgorgement of profits, cessation of business activities or divestiture. Any such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe FDA, the FTC and their state-level equivalents, also possess broad authority to enforce the provisions of federal and state law, respectively, applicable to consumer products and safeguards as such relate to foods, dietary supplements and cosmetics, including powers to issue a public warning or notice of violation letter to a Company, publicize information about illegal products, detain products intended for import or export (in conjunction with U.S. Customs and Border Protection) or otherwise deemed illegal, request a recall of illegal products from the market, and request the Department of Justice, or the state-level equivalent, to initiate a seizure action, an injunction action, or a criminal prosecution in the U.S. or respective state courts. The initiation of any regulatory action towards industrial hemp or hemp derivatives by the FDA, the FTC or any other related federal or state agency, would result in greater legal cost to the Company, may result in substantial financial penalties and enjoinment from certain business-related activities, and if such actions were publicly reported, they may have a materially adverse effect on our business and its results of operations.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTING IN OUR COMPANY AND OUR SECURITIES\nOur Series D preferred stock is subordinate to our existing and future debt, and interests of the Series D preferred stock could be diluted by the issuance of additional preferred shares and by other transactions.\nThe Series D preferred stock ranks junior to all of our existing and future debt and to other non-equity claims on us and our assets available to satisfy claims against us, including claims in bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceedings. Our future debt may include restrictions on our ability to pay distributions to preferred stockholders. Our charter currently authorizes the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more classes or series. At December 31, 2019, there were 161,135 shares of Series A preferred stock designated all of which are outstanding, 1,052,631 shares of Series B preferred stock designated of which 129,332 are outstanding, 700,000 shares of Series C preferred stock designated of which no shares of Series C preferred stock were outstanding, and 650,000 shares of Series D preferred stock designated of which 578,898 shares of Series D preferred stock are outstanding. Subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law and our charter, our board of directors is authorized to issue, from our authorized but unissued shares of capital stock, preferred stock in such classes or series as our board of directors may determine and to establish from time to time the number of shares of preferred stock to be included in any such class or series. The issuance of additional shares of Series D preferred stock or additional shares of Series A preferred stock, Series B preferred stock or Series C preferred stock or another series of preferred stock designated as ranking on parity with the Series D preferred stock would dilute the interests of the holders of shares of the Series D preferred stock and our other security holders, and the issuance of shares of any class or series of our capital stock expressly designated as ranking senior to the Series D preferred stock or the incurrence of additional indebtedness could affect our ability to pay distributions on, redeem or pay the liquidation preference on the Series D preferred stock. The Series D preferred stock does not contain any terms relating to or limiting our indebtedness or affording the holders of shares of the Series D preferred stock protection in the event of a highly leveraged or other transaction, including a merger or the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all our assets, that might adversely affect the holders of shares of the Series D preferred stock, so long as the rights, preferences, privileges or voting power of the Series D preferred stock or the holders thereof are not materially and adversely affected.\nNone of our preferred stock has been rated.\nNone of our preferred stock has been rated by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization, which may negatively affect their market value and your ability to sell such shares. No assurance can be given, however, that one or more rating agencies might not independently determine to issue such a rating or that such a rating, if issued, would not adversely affect the market price of our Series D preferred stock. In addition, we may elect in the future to obtain a rating of our Series D preferred stock, which could adversely impact the market price of our Series D preferred stock. Ratings only reflect the views of the rating agency or agencies issuing the ratings and such ratings could be revised downward or withdrawn entirely at the discretion of the issuing rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Any such downward revision or withdrawal of a rating could have an adverse effect on the market price of our Series D preferred stock.\nA holder of shares of the Series D preferred stock has extremely limited voting rights.\nThe voting rights as a holder of shares of the Series D preferred stock are limited. Our shares of common stock are the only class of our securities carrying full voting rights. Voting rights for holders of shares of the Series D preferred stock exist primarily with respect to adverse changes in the terms of the Series D preferred stock and the creation of additional classes or series of preferred shares that are senior to the Series D preferred stock.\nOur cash available for distributions may not be sufficient to pay distributions on the Series D preferred stock at expected levels, and we cannot assure you of our ability to pay distributions in the future. We may use borrowed funds or funds from other sources to pay distributions, which may adversely impact our operations.\nWe intend to pay regular monthly distributions to holders of our Series D preferred stock. Distributions declared by us will be authorized by our board of directors in its sole discretion out of assets legally available for distribution and will depend upon a number of factors, including our earnings, our financial condition, restrictions under applicable law, our need to comply with the terms of our existing financing arrangements, the capital requirements of our company and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. We may be required to fund distributions from working capital, proceeds of this offering or a sale of assets to the extent distributions exceed earnings or cash flows from operations. Funding distributions from working capital would restrict our operations. If we are required to sell assets to fund distributions, such asset sales may occur at a time or in a manner that is not consistent with our disposition strategy. If we borrow to fund distributions, our leverage ratios and future interest costs would increase, thereby reducing our earnings and cash available for distribution from what they otherwise would have been. We may not be able to pay distributions in the future. In addition, some of our distributions may be considered a return of capital for income tax purposes. If we decide to make distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, such distributions would generally be considered a return of capital for federal income tax purposes to the extent of the holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its shares. A return of capital is not taxable, but it has the effect of reducing the holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its investment. If distributions exceed the adjusted tax basis of a holder\u2019s shares, they will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of such stock.\nWe could be prevented from paying cash dividends on the Series D preferred stock due to prescribed legal requirements.\nHolders of shares of Series D preferred stock do not have a right to dividends on such shares unless declared or set aside for payment by our board of directors. Under Delaware law, cash dividends on capital stock may only be paid from \u201csurplus\u201d or, if there is no \u201csurplus,\u201d from the corporation\u2019s net profits for the then-current or the preceding fiscal year. Unless we operate profitably, our ability to pay cash dividends on the Series D preferred stock would require the availability of adequate \u201csurplus,\u201d which is defined as the excess, if any, of net assets (total assets less total liabilities) over capital. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to pay dividends on the Series D preferred stock when payable. Further, even if adequate surplus is available to pay cash dividends on the Series D preferred stock, we may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends on the Series D preferred stock.\nFurthermore, no dividends on Series D preferred stock shall be authorized by our board of directors or paid, declared or set aside for payment by us at any time when the authorization, payment, declaration or setting aside for payment would be unlawful under Delaware law or any other applicable law.\nWe may redeem the Series D preferred stock and holders of the Series D preferred may not receive dividends that you anticipate if we do redeem the Series D.\nOn or after September 23, 2022 we may, at our option, redeem the Series D preferred stock, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time. Also, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, we may, at our option, redeem the Series D preferred stock, in whole or in part, within 120 days after the first date on which such Change of Control occurred. We may have an incentive to redeem the Series D preferred stock voluntarily if market conditions allow us to issue other preferred stock or debt securities at a rate that is lower than the dividend rate on the Series D preferred stock. If we redeem the Series D preferred stock, then from and after the redemption date, dividends will cease to accrue on shares of Series D preferred stock, the shares of Series D preferred stock shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights as a holder of those shares will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price plus accumulated and unpaid dividends, if any, payable upon redemption.\nHolders of shares of the Series D preferred stock should not expect us to redeem the Series D preferred stock on or after the date they become redeemable at our option.\nThe Series D preferred stock will be a perpetual equity security. This means that it will have no maturity or mandatory redemption date and will not be redeemable at the option of the holders. The Series D preferred stock may be redeemed by us at our option either in whole or in part, from time to time, at any time on or after September 23, 2022, or upon the occurrence of a Change of Control. Any decision we may make at any time to propose a redemption of the Series D preferred stock will depend upon, among other things, our evaluation of our capital position, the composition of our stockholders\u2019 equity and general market conditions at that time.\nThe Series D preferred stock is not convertible, and investors will not realize a corresponding upside if the price of the common stock increases.\nThe Series D preferred stock is not convertible into shares of our common stock and earns dividends at a fixed rate. Accordingly, an increase in market price of our common stock will not necessarily result in an increase in the market price of our Series D preferred stock. The market value of the Series D preferred stock may depend more on dividend and interest rates for other preferred stock, commercial paper and other investment alternatives and our actual and perceived ability to pay dividends on, and in the event of dissolution satisfy the liquidation preference with respect to, the Series D preferred stock.\nThe change of control provisions in the Series D preferred stock may make it more difficult for a party to acquire us or discourage a party from acquiring us.\nThe change of control provisions in the Series D preferred stock may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us or of delaying, deferring or preventing certain of our change of control transactions under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our Series D preferred stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-current market price of such equity securities or that stockholders may otherwise believe is in their best interests.\nThe market price and trading volume of the common stock and Series D preferred stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market determines the trading price for our common stock and the Series D preferred stock and may be influenced by many factors, including our ability to timely complete our required filings with the SEC, variations in our financial results, the market for similar securities, investors\u2019 perception of us, our history of paying distributions on the Series D preferred stock, our issuance of additional preferred equity or indebtedness and general economic, industry, interest rate and market conditions. The de-listing of our the common stock and Series D preferred from the Nasdaq has limited investors\u2019 ability to transfer or sell shares of common stock or the Series D preferred stock and has materially adversely affected the market value of the common stock and Series D preferred stock Because the Series D preferred stock carries a fixed distribution rate, its value in the secondary market will also be influenced by changes in interest rates and will tend to move inversely to such changes.\nIn the event of a liquidation, a holder of Series D preferred stock may not receive the full amount of your liquidation preference.\nIn the event of our liquidation of the Company, the proceeds will be used first to repay indebtedness and then to pay holders of shares of the Series D preferred stock and any other class or series of our capital stock ranking senior to or on parity with the Series D preferred stock as to liquidation the amount of each holder\u2019s liquidation preference and accrued and unpaid distributions through the date of payment. In the event we have insufficient funds to make payments in full to holders of the shares of the Series D preferred stock and any other class or series of our capital stock ranking senior to or on parity with the Series D preferred stock as to liquidation, such funds will be distributed ratably among such holders and such holders may not realize the full amount of their liquidation preference.\nWe are generally restricted from issuing shares of other series of preferred stock that rank senior the Series D preferred stock as to dividend rights, rights upon liquidation or voting rights, but may do so with the requisite consent of the holders of the Series D preferred stock; and, further, no such consent is required for an increase in the number of shares of Series D preferred stock or the issuance of additional shares of Series D preferred stock or series of preferred stock ranking pari passu with the Series D preferred stock so long as such increase in the number of shares of Series D preferred stock or issuance of such new series of preferred stock does not provide for, in the aggregate (taken together with any previously issued shares of Series D preferred stock), the payment of annual dividends on (in the case of additional shares of Series D preferred stock), or on parity with (in the case of any other series of preferred stock) in excess of $2,437,500.\nWe are allowed to issue shares of other series of preferred stock that rank above the Series D preferred stock as to dividend payments and rights upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs, only with the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding Series D preferred stock; however, we are allowed to increase the number of shares of Series D preferred stock and/or additional series of preferred stock that would rank equally to the Series D preferred stock as to dividend payments and rights upon our liquidation or winding up of our affairs without first obtaining the approval of the holders of our Series D preferred stock, so long as such increase in the number of shares of Series D preferred stock or issuance of such new series of preferred stock does not provide for, in the aggregate (taken together with any previously issued shares of Series D preferred stock), the payment of annual dividends on (in the case of additional shares of Series D preferred stock), or on parity with (in the case of any other series of preferred stock) in excess of $2,437,500. The issuance of additional shares of Series D preferred stock and/or additional series of preferred stock could have the effect of reducing the amounts available to the Series D preferred stock upon our liquidation or dissolution or the winding up of our affairs. It also may reduce dividend payments on the Series D preferred stock if we do not have sufficient funds to pay dividends on all Series D preferred stock outstanding and other classes or series of stock with equal or senior priority with respect to dividends. Future issuances and sales of senior or pari passu preferred stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales could occur, may cause prevailing market prices for the Series D preferred stock and our common stock to decline and may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital in the financial markets at times and prices favorable to us.\nThe market price of the Series D preferred stock could be substantially affected by various factors.\nThe market price of the Series D preferred stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors. On February 26, 2021, the last trading price of our Series D preferred stock was $10.61 and on May 28, 2021 it was $13.82. The price of the Series D preferred stock that will prevail in the market after this offering may be higher or lower than the offering price depending on many factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating performance.\nThese factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf\nprevailing interest rates, increases in which we expect may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Series D preferred stock;\n\u25cf\ntrading prices of similar securities;\n\u25cf\nour history of timely dividend payments;\n\u25cf\nthe annual yield from dividends on the Series D preferred stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments;\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic and financial market conditions;\n\u25cf\ngovernment action or regulation;\n\u25cf\nthe financial condition, performance and prospects of us and our competitors;\n\u25cf\nchanges in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us or our competitors in our industry;\n\u25cf\nour issuance of additional preferred equity or debt securities; and\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results of us and our competitors.\nAs a result of these and other factors, investors who purchase the Series D preferred stock in this offering may experience a decrease, which could be substantial and rapid, in the market price of the Series D preferred stock, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects.\nOur two principal stockholders who are also our Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and director and our Chief Operating Officer have significant influence over us.\nThrough their voting power, each of Stephan Wallach and Michelle Wallach has the ability to significantly influence the election of our directors and to control all other matters requiring the approval of our stockholders. Stephan Wallach and Michelle Wallach, his wife, together beneficially own approximately 42.3% of our total equity securities (assuming exercise of the options to purchase common stock held by Stephan Wallach and Michelle Wallach) at May 31, 2021. As our Chief Executive Officer, Stephan Wallach has the ability to control our business affairs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018 we reported under an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and any decision on our part to comply with certain reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nAt December 31, 2018, we were no longer an emerging growth company under the Jobs Act. However, during 2018 we were an emerging growth company up until December 31, 2018.\nAn \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined under the Jobs Act, and, for as long as we continued to be an emerging growth company, we could choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nUnder the Jobs Act, a company is deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the Jobs Act, that allowed us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that had different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. Further, as a result of these scaled regulatory requirements, our disclosure for the year ended December 31, 2018 may be more limited than that of other public companies and you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of such companies.\nWe ceased to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d which means we will no longer be able to take advantage of certain reduced disclosure requirements in our public filings.\nWe ceased to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jobs Act, on December 31, 2018. As a result, we anticipate that costs and compliance initiatives will increase as a result of the fact that we ceased to be an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d In particular, we are now, or will be, subject to certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that had not been applicable to us as an emerging growth company. These requirements include:\n\u25cf\ncompliance with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting once we are an accelerated filer or large accelerated filer;\n\u25cf\ncompliance with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n\u25cf\nfull disclosure and analysis obligations regarding executive compensation; and\n\u25cf\ncompliance with regulatory requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the applicable regulations in a timely manner, if at all.\nOur stock has historically had a limited market. If an active trading market for our common stock does develop, trading prices may be volatile.\nIn the event that an active trading market develops, the market price of the shares of common stock may be based on factors that may not be indicative of future market performance. Consequently, the market price of the common stock may vary greatly. If an active market for the common stock develops, there is a significant risk that the stock price may fluctuate dramatically in the future in response to any of the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u25cf\nvariations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf\nannouncements that our revenue or income/loss levels are below analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic slowdowns;\n\u25cf\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts; or\n\u25cf\nacquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments.\nThe requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, have strained our resources and, increased our costs, and we may continue to be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAs a public company, we must comply with the federal securities laws, rules and regulations, including certain corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) and the Dodd-Frank Act, related rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq, with which a private company is not required to comply.\nWe have been unable to comply with requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner. Complying with these laws, rules and regulations occupies a significant amount of the time of our Board of Directors and management and significantly increases our costs and expenses. Among other things, we must:\n\u25cf\nmaintain a system of internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;\n\u25cf\ncomply with rules and regulations promulgated by OTC Markets;\n\u25cf\nprepare and distribute periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws;\n\u25cf\nmaintain various internal compliance and disclosures policies, such as those relating to disclosure controls and procedures and insider trading in our common stock;\n\u25cf\ninvolve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the above activities;\n\u25cf\nmaintain a comprehensive internal audit function; and\n\u25cf\nmaintain an investor relations function.\nSales by our shareholders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nA large number of outstanding shares of common stock are held by two of our principal shareholders. If any of these principal shareholders were to decide to sell large amounts of stock over a short period of time such sales could cause the market price of the common stock to decline.\nOur stock price has been volatile and subject to various market conditions.\nThe trading price of the common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations. On May 11, 2021 the closing price of our common stock was $0.39 and on May 21, 2021 it was $0.31. The price of the common stock may fluctuate in the future in response to quarter-to-quarter variations in operating results, material announcements by us or our competitors, governmental regulatory action, conditions in the nutritional supplement industry, negative publicity, or other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, the stock market has historically experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, which have particularly affected the market prices of many dietary and nutritional supplement companies and which have, in certain cases, not had a strong correlation to the operating performance of these companies. Our operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. If that were to occur, the price of the common stock would likely decline, perhaps substantially.\nSecurities analysts may not cover our capital stock, and this may have a negative impact on the market price of our capital stock.\nThe trading market for our capital stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by independent securities and industry analysts. If no independent securities or industry analysts commence coverage of us, the trading prices for our capital stock would be negatively impacted. If we obtain independent securities or industry analyst coverage and if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our capital stock, changes their opinion of our shares or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our capital stock could decrease and we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nWe may issue preferred stock with rights senior to the common stock, Series A preferred stock and Series B preferred stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to five million shares of preferred stock without shareholder approval and on terms established by our directors. We may issue shares of preferred stock in order to consummate a financing or other transaction, in lieu of the issuance of common stock. The rights and preferences of any such class or series of preferred stock would be established by our board of directors in its sole discretion and may have dividend, voting, liquidation and other rights and preferences that are senior to the rights of the common stock and existing preferred stock.\nYou should not rely on an investment in our common stock for the payment of cash dividends.\nWe intend to retain future profits, if any, to expand our business. We have never paid cash dividends on the common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on the common stock in the foreseeable future. You should not make an investment in the common stock if you require dividend income. Any return on investment in the common stock would only come from an increase in the market price of our stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as amended and restated, may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws includes provisions that:\n\u25cf\nauthorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock, without further stockholder action and with voting liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock; and\n\u25cf\nprovide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by the vote of a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder. Any of the foregoing provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of common stock, and they could deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you would receive a premium for the common stock in an acquisition.\nReports published by securities or industry analysts, including projections in those reports that exceed our actual results, could adversely affect our common stock price and trading volume.\nSecurities research analysts, including those affiliated with our selling agents establish and publish their own periodic projections for our business. These projections may vary widely from one another and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our stock price may decline if our actual results do not match securities research analysts' projections. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who writes reports on us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, our stock price or trading volume could decline. While we expect securities research analyst coverage following this offering, if no securities or industry analysts begin to cover us, the trading price for our stock and the trading volume could be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 16808, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "YGYI"}
