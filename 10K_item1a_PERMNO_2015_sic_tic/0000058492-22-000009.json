{"cik": "58492", "company": "LEGGETT & PLATT INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our securities involves risk. Set forth below and elsewhere in this report are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. We may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC.\nPART I\nOPERATIONAL RISK FACTORS\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could further have, an adverse impact to (i) our manufacturing operations' ability to remain fully operational; and (ii) our ability to obtain necessary raw materials and parts, maintain appropriate labor levels, and ship finished products to customers due to supply chain disruptions or otherwise; all of which, in the aggregate, have had, and could further have, a negative impact on our trade sales, earnings, liquidity, cash flow, financial condition, and our stock price.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had manufacturing facilities in 18 countries. All of these countries have been, and are continuing to be, affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our facilities are open and running at this time. From time to time, we have some capacity restrictions on our plants due to governmental orders in various parts of the world. We have been and could be further negatively affected by governmental action in any one or more of the countries in which we operate by the imposition, or re-imposition, of restrictive social measures, mandatory closures of retail establishments that sell our products or our customers\u2019 products, travel restrictions, and restrictions on the import or export of products.\nDepending on the length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the percentage of the population vaccinated, and the effectiveness of the vaccines against new variants, our ability to keep our manufacturing operations fully operational, build and maintain appropriate labor levels, obtain necessary raw materials and parts, and ship finished products to customers, due to supply chain disruptions or otherwise, may be partially or completely disrupted, either on a temporary or prolonged basis. The continued realization of these risks to our manufacturing operations, labor force, and supply chain could also increase labor, commodity, and energy costs.\nSome facilities have experienced supply chain problems delivering products to customers and disruptions in logistics necessary to import, export, or transfer products, which have generally resulted in increased freight costs that are typically passed through to our customers. Our supply chains have also been hampered by congested ports. More specifically, we have experienced supply chain disruptions related to semiconductor shortages, foam chemical shortages, labor availability, and freight challenges, as well as higher costs associated with each of these issues. This has resulted in reduced volume and higher costs in most of our businesses, including our Automotive business and Bedding Products segment, primarily related to negative impacts on component demand and finished goods production. If we are unable to obtain necessary raw materials or experience disruptions in delivering products to our customers, our results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nWhen our employees have tested positive for COVID-19 or may have come in contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19, we follow adopted protocols which may include enhanced disinfecting in targeted areas, contact tracing, testing, mask wearing, and mandating certain isolation and quarantine periods. A significant increase in COVID-19 cases among our employees may disrupt our ability to maintain necessary labor levels and produce and deliver products to our customers if we are unable to shift production to other manufacturing facilities.\nCertain governmental authorities, including state or foreign jurisdictions, may adopt laws mandating COVID-19 vaccination or periodic testing with masking requirements for unvaccinated employees. Because some of our employees may be hesitant to take a vaccine or be tested, the requirements, if adopted, may cause some employees to terminate employment with us which may challenge our ability to maintain appropriate labor levels in our facilities and keep our manufacturing locations fully operational. If these requirements are adopted, they may also create disruptions to our suppliers and customers.\nBusiness disruptions to our steel rod mill, if coupled with an inability to purchase an adequate and/or timely supply of quality steel rod from alternative sources, could have a material negative impact on our Bedding Products segment and the Company's results of operations.\nWe purchase steel scrap from third party suppliers. This scrap is converted into steel rod in our mill in Sterling, Illinois. Our steel rod mill has historically had annual output of approximately 500,000 tons, a substantial majority of which has been used internally by our wire mills, which convert the steel rod into drawn steel wire. This wire is used in the production of many of our products, including mattress innersprings.\nA disruption to the operation of, or supply of steel scrap to, our steel rod mill could require us to purchase steel rod from alternative supply sources, subject to market availability. Ongoing trade action by the United States government, along with the existence of antidumping and countervailing duty orders against multiple countries, could result in reduced market availability and/or higher cost of steel rod.\nPART I\nIf we experience a disruption to our ability to produce steel rod in our mill, coupled with a reduction of adequate and/or timely supply from alternative market sources of quality steel rod, we could experience a material negative impact on our Bedding Products segment and the Company's results of operations.\nFINANCIAL RISK FACTORS\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could further have, an adverse impact on the collection of trade and other notes receivable in accordance with their terms due to customer bankruptcy, financial difficulties, or insolvency.\nBeginning in early 2020, many of our customers and other third parties were adversely affected by the social and governmental restrictions and limitations related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of this, we believed the risk of customer nonpayment increased. As such, in the first quarter of 2020, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by $20 million, including $9 million associated with a single customer in our Bedding Products segment (fully reserving the balances for this customer). As 2020 progressed, worldwide conditions stabilized, and our bad debt expense finished at $17 million for the year. During 2021, as social and governmental restrictions and limitations were relaxed, trends in customer payment experience and macroeconomic conditions improved and accordingly, we believe the risk of customer nonpayment decreased. Because of these improvements, we reduced our allowance for doubtful accounts by $3 million for 2021.\nIf our customers continue to be adversely affected by COVID-19 they may suffer significant financial difficulty. As a result, they may be unable to pay their debts to us, they may reject their contractual obligations to us under bankruptcy laws or otherwise, or we may have to negotiate significant discounts and/or extend financing terms with these parties. If we are unable to collect trade receivables and other notes receivable on a timely basis, larger provisions for bad debt may be required and result in a negative impact on our earnings, liquidity, cash flow, and financial condition.\nOur goodwill and other long-lived assets are subject to potential impairment which could negatively impact our earnings.\nA significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired. At December 31, 2021, goodwill and other intangible assets represented $2.2 billion, or 41% of our total assets. In addition, net property, plant, and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, and sundry assets totaled $1.1 billion, or 20% of total assets.\nWe review our reporting units for potential goodwill impairment in the second quarter as part of our annual goodwill impairment testing, and more often if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists. In addition, we test for the recoverability of long-lived assets at year end, and more often if an event or circumstance indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable. We conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations.\nOur annual goodwill impairment testing performed in the second quarter of 2021 indicated no goodwill impairments. However, fair value exceeds carrying value by less than 100% for two reporting units as summarized in the table below:\nThe decrease in fair value for Aerospace, as compared to 2020, is reflective of industry trends. Demand for fabricated duct assemblies in 2021 was near 2019 levels, but demand for welded and seamless tube products is still well below pre-pandemic levels. With the lingering impact from pandemic-related disruption in air travel and resulting buildup of aircraft and supply chain inventories, the industry is not anticipated to return to 2019 demand levels until 2024. While there is also a lag in recovery in the Work Furniture reporting unit, we continue to see steady demand for products sold for residential use, and the contract market continues to gradually improve as employees return to the office. We are continuing to\nPART I\nmonitor all factors impacting these industries. If the adverse economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic is longer than expected, we may not be able to achieve projected performance levels. If actual results of any of our reporting units materially differ from the assumptions and estimates used in the goodwill and long-lived asset valuation calculations, we could incur future impairment charges. These non-cash charges could have a material negative impact on our earnings.\nFor more information regarding potential goodwill and other long-lived asset impairment, please refer to Note C on page 83 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIf we do not comply with the restrictive covenants in our credit facility, we may not be able to borrow in the commercial paper market or under our credit facility and our outstanding debt instruments may default, all of which could adversely impact our liquidity.\nOur credit facility is a multi-currency facility maturing in September 2026, providing us the ability, from time to time, to borrow, repay, and re-borrow up to $1.2 billion, subject to certain restrictive covenants and customary conditions. The credit facility serves as back-up for our commercial paper borrowing.\nOur credit facility was amended effective September 30, 2021 and contains revised restrictive covenants. The amended covenants (a) require us to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter (i) Consolidated Funded Indebtedness minus the lesser of: (A) Unrestricted Cash, or (B) $750 million to (ii) Consolidated EBITDA for the four consecutive trailing quarters, such ratio not being greater than 3.50 to 1.00, provided, however, subject to certain limitations, if the Company has made a Material Acquisition in any fiscal quarter, at the Company\u2019s election, the maximum Leverage Ratio shall be 4.00 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter during which such Material Acquisition is consummated and the next three consecutive fiscal quarters; (b) limit the amount of total secured debt to 15% of our total consolidated assets, and (c) limit our ability to sell, lease, transfer or dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (other than accounts receivable sold in a Permitted Securitization Transaction, products sold in the ordinary course of business and our ability to sell, lease, transfer or dispose of any of the assets of the Company or one of its subsidiaries to the Company or one of its subsidiaries, as applicable) at any given point in time; each (a), (b), and (c) above as determined by the terms of the Credit Agreement, filed with the SEC on October 1, 2021 as Exhibit 10.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K.\nIf our earnings are reduced because of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, the covenants in the credit facility will reduce our borrowing capacity, both under the credit facility or through commercial paper issuances. Depending on the degree of earnings reduction, our liquidity could be materially negatively impacted. This covenant may also restrict our current and future operations, including (i) our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our businesses and industries; and (ii) our ability to use our cash flows, or obtain additional financing, for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes. If we are not in compliance with the restrictive covenants in our credit facility, we may not be able to access the commercial paper market or borrow under the credit facility.\nAlso, if we fail to comply with the covenants specified in the credit facility, we may trigger an event of default, in which case the lenders would have the right to: (i) terminate their commitment to provide loans under the credit facility; and (ii) declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. Additionally, our senior notes contain cross-default provisions which could make outstanding amounts under the senior notes immediately payable in the event of an acceleration of amounts due under the credit facility following a material uncured default. If debt under the credit facility or senior notes were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash to repay this debt, which would have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet depending upon the amount and source of future taxable income.\nOur ability to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet is dependent upon the amount and source of future taxable income. As of December 31, 2021, we had $121 million of deferred tax assets ($137 million less a $16 million valuation allowance). After netting of deferred tax liabilities, the net amount presented within Sundry assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets is $9 million. It is possible the amount and source of our taxable income could materially change in the future. Particularly, our mix of earnings by taxing jurisdiction may materially change in that we may have more or less taxable income generated in North America, Europe, or Asia as compared to prior years. This change may\nPART I\nimpact our underlying assumptions on which valuation allowances are established and negatively affect future period earnings and balance sheets. As a result, we may not be able to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet.\nMARKET RISK FACTORS\nVolatile raw material and labor costs and availability could negatively affect our profit margins and earnings.\nRaw material cost increases (and our ability to respond to cost increases through selling price increases) can significantly impact our earnings. We typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; accordingly, our raw material costs generally move with the market. When we experience significant increases in raw material costs, we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs. Inability to recover cost increases (or a delay in the recovery time) can negatively impact our earnings. Conversely, if raw material costs decrease, we generally pass through reduced selling prices to our customers. Reduced selling prices combined with higher cost inventory can reduce our profit margins and earnings.\nSteel is our principal raw material. The global steel markets are cyclical in nature and have been volatile in recent years. This volatility can result in large swings in pricing and margins from year to year.\nAs a producer of steel rod, we are also impacted by volatility in metal margins (the difference between the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod). If market conditions cause scrap costs and rod pricing to change at different rates (both in terms of timing and amount), metal margins could be compressed, and this would negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe have exposure to the cost of chemicals, including TDI, MDI, and polyol. The cost of these chemicals has fluctuated at times, but we have generally passed the changes through to our customers. Chemical prices deflated in the first half of 2020. Inflation began in the second half of the year and continued throughout 2021 as a result of several factors, including robust demand, shortages from severe weather, supplier production disruptions, port delays, and logistics challenges. The supply shortages resulted in significant restrictions by producers, however, supply availability improved in late fourth quarter 2021. We import certain chemicals to supplement domestic supply, but port delays and logistics issues could limit access to those products. If we are unable to obtain the chemicals or pass the cost along to our customers, our results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nCurrently there is a shortage of semiconductors in the automotive industry. Automotive OEMs and other suppliers have not been able to secure an adequate supply of semiconductors, and as a result have reduced or completely shut down their production of some automobiles or parts, which in turn has reduced our sale of products. Consumer demand remains strong, but the semiconductor shortage has pushed vehicle inventories to very low levels. Our Automotive Group uses the semiconductors in seat comfort products, and to a lesser extent in motors and actuators. To date, our Automotive Group has been able to obtain an adequate supply of semiconductors. We are dependent on our suppliers to deliver these semiconductors in accordance with our production schedule, and a shortage of the semiconductors can disrupt our operations and our ability to deliver products to our customers. If we cannot secure an adequate supply of semiconductors in our supply chain, or the automotive OEMs and other suppliers continue to reduce their production as a result of such shortage, this may negatively impact our sales, earnings, and financial condition.\nSome facilities have experienced disruptions in logistics necessary to import or transfer raw materials, which has generally resulted in increased transportation costs that are typically passed through to our customers. Our supply chains have also been hampered by congested ports and trucking constraints. This could impact the availability of certain raw materials and parts that we use in our manufacturing process.\nHigher raw material costs could lead some of our customers to modify their product designs, changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods and replacing higher-cost components with lower-cost components. If this were to occur, it could negatively impact our results of operations.\nBecause of shortages in the labor markets, several industries in which we operate have experienced challenges in hiring and maintaining adequate workforce levels, as well as increased labor costs. If this continues, our results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nUnfair competition could adversely affect our market share, sales, profit margins, and earnings.\nWe produce innersprings for mattresses that are sold to bedding manufacturers. We produce steel wire rod for consumption by our wire mills (primarily to produce innersprings) and to sell to third parties. We also produce and sell finished mattresses.\nPART I\nSince 2009, there have been antidumping duties on the import of innersprings from China, South Africa, and Vietnam imposed by the Department of Commerce (DOC) and International Trade Commission (ITC) extending through 2024. The DOC and ITC have also imposed antidumping duties and countervailing duties on imports of steel wire rod from various countries, including China. These duties will expire, unless extended, at different times ranging from 2022 to 2025. Also, antidumping duties have been imposed by the DOC and ITC on the import of finished mattresses from various countries including China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Serbia, Thailand, Turkey, and Vietnam, which will expire, unless extended, at different times ranging from 2024 to 2026. If the existing antidumping and countervailing duties are overturned on appeal or not extended beyond their current terms and dumping and/or subsidization recurs, or manufacturers in the subject countries circumvent the existing duties through transshipment in other jurisdictions or otherwise, our market share, sales, profit margins, and earnings could be adversely affected.\nOur borrowing costs and access to liquidity may be impacted by our credit ratings.\nIndependent rating agencies evaluate our credit profile on an ongoing basis and have assigned ratings for our long-term and short-term debt. If our credit ratings are lowered below investment grade, we may not be able to access the commercial paper market. If this occurs, we expect to borrow under our credit facility for our liquidity needs but at higher interest costs. Because of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or otherwise, our credit ratings could decline. If this were to occur, our borrowing costs could increase materially, and our access to sources of liquidity, including the commercial paper market, may be adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk which may negatively impact our competitiveness, profit margins, and earnings.\nInternational sales have represented a significant percentage of our total sales, which exposes us to currency exchange rate fluctuations. In 2021, 36% of our sales were generated by international operations, primarily in Europe, China, Canada, and Mexico. We expect that a significant amount of our sales will continue to come from outside the United States in the future. Nearly 50 of our manufacturing facilities are located outside the United States. We are also exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations by our purchase of raw materials and component parts from suppliers in multiple countries. We experience currency-related gains and losses where sales or purchases are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. As of December 31, 2021, we had foreign exchange rate risk associated with the U.S. Dollar, Chinese Yuan, Euro, Canadian Dollar, British Pound Sterling, Danish Krone, Mexican Peso, Swiss Franc, and Polish Zloty. If these exchange rates devalue the currency we receive for the sale of our products, or the currency we use to purchase raw materials or component parts from our suppliers, it may have a material adverse effect on our competitiveness, profit margins, and earnings.\nFor more information regarding currency exchange rate risk, please refer to Note S on page 117 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could further have, an adverse impact to the market demand for our products and our customers\u2019 products, growth rates in the industries in which we participate, and opportunities in those industries.\nBecause of the COVID-19 pandemic various governments, primarily impacting us in North America, Europe, and Asia, and elsewhere have instituted, and may reinstitute quarantines, shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders, or restrictions on public gatherings as well as limitations on social interactions. These restrictions and limitations have had, and could further have, an adverse effect on the economies and financial markets of the countries where our products, or our customers\u2019 products, are sold. The resulting economic downturn has had, and could further have, an effect on the market demand for our products and our customers\u2019 products, growth rates in the industries in which we participate, and opportunities in those industries. As a result of the decreased market demand, our trade sales, earnings, liquidity, cash flow, and financial condition have been and could be further materially negatively affected.\nPART I\nTECHNOLOGY AND CYBERSECURITY RISK FACTORS\nTechnology failures or cybersecurity breaches could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 131 production facilities in 18 different countries, primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia. We rely on several on-premise and cloud-based computerized systems and networks to obtain, secure, process, analyze, and manage data, as well as to facilitate the manufacture and distribution of inventory to and from our production facilities. We receive, process, manufacture, and ship orders, manage the billing of and collections from our customers, and manage the accounting for and payment to our vendors. We also have risk associated with the network connectivity and systems for consolidated reporting. Technology failures or security breaches of a new or existing infrastructure, including our industrial control systems, could impede normal operations, create system disruptions, or create unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.\nWe have a formal process in place for both incident response and cybersecurity continuous improvement that includes a cross functional Cybersecurity Oversight Committee. Members of the Cybersecurity Oversight Committee update the Board of Directors quarterly on cyber activity, with procedures in place for interim reporting if necessary.\nAlthough we have not experienced any material technology failures or cybersecurity breaches, we have enhanced our cybersecurity protection efforts over the last few years and continue to do so. We use a third party to periodically benchmark our information security program against the National Institute of Standards and Technology\u2019s Cybersecurity Framework. We provide quarterly cybersecurity training for employees with access to our email and data systems, and we have purchased broad-form cyber insurance coverage. However, in part, because of the risk due to the COVID-19 pandemic regarding increased remote access, remote work conditions, and associated strain on employees, technology failures or cybersecurity breaches could still create system disruptions or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. We cannot be certain that the attacker\u2019s capabilities will not compromise our technology protecting information systems. We could still experience material technology failures or cybersecurity breaches, including those resulting from ransomware attached to our industrial control systems. If this occurs, our operations could be disrupted, or we may suffer financial loss because of lost or misappropriated information. Also, we may incur remediation costs, increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information, litigation and legal costs, reputational damages, proprietary and confidentiality impacts, damage to our competitiveness, and negative impact on our stock price and long-term shareholder value.\nTRADE RISK FACTORS\nTariffs by the United States government could result in materially lower margins, lost sales, and an overall adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWhile we frequently manufacture products where our customers are located, we do, in some cases, import and export various raw materials, components, or finished goods across several business units, including the Automotive and Bedding groups and the Machinery business. The United States has imposed broad-ranging tariffs on steel and aluminum (each of which we use in our manufacturing processes), a wide assortment of Chinese-made products, and other products on a country-specific basis. In retaliation, many other countries have imposed counter-tariffs on US-produced items. If we are unable to pass through additional costs created by these tariffs, it could result in materially lower margins, lost sales, and an overall adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union could adversely affect us.\nIn June 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (EU), commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d In January 2020, the Withdrawal Agreement Act was passed by the UK Parliament and the Brexit deal was ratified by the EU Parliament. This allowed the UK to formally leave the EU on January 31, 2020, with a transition period through December 31, 2020, while the EU and UK were to negotiate a trade agreement, among other things. Additional negotiations among the EU and UK continue, as well as negotiations of trade agreements between the UK and other countries, including the United States. Because we have multiple manufacturing facilities in the UK, EU, and other countries, and these facilities purchase raw materials and component parts from suppliers in those countries, and sell products into the UK, EU, and elsewhere, the results of Brexit could cause disruptions and create uncertainty to our supply chain and distribution networks, tariff rates, and currencies, and could fluctuate the\nPART I\nvalue of the British Pound and the Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar and other currencies. These disruptions and uncertainties could increase our costs and adversely affect us.\nREGULATORY RISK FACTORS\nPrivacy and data protection regulations are complex and could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nGovernments around the world have adopted legislative and regulatory proposals concerning the collection and use of personal data. As a multi-national company with employee personal data and business contact information from individuals in many countries, we are subject to many different data protection laws, including those in the U.S., and the laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate, such as those in Europe, China, and Brazil. For example, the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR applies to our operations that collect or process personal data of EU individuals and UK individuals, respectively. If our operations are found to violate GDPR or the UK GDPR, we may incur substantial fines, face reputational harm, and be required to change our business practices, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAs a U.S. company, the ability to centrally manage aspects of our operation and workforce and the ability to make decisions based on complete and accurate global data are important and require the ability to transfer and access personal data. The adequacy of the laws of the data-importing country are of increasing importance under various laws, including the GDPR, the UK GDPR, and Brazil\u2019s general data protection law. The validity of data transfer mechanisms remains subject to legal, regulatory, and political developments in many countries, including Brazil, Europe, China, and the U.S. The invalidation of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield in 2020, the complex assessment and documentation requirements required under the EU Commission's recent Standard Contractual Clauses, as well as the still evolving guidance from Brazil and China, could have an adverse impact on our ability to process and transfer personal data. This may inhibit our ability to transfer our employee personal data from our other operations, such as in Europe, China, and Brazil, to the Company\u2019s headquarters in the U.S. or elsewhere, making it much more difficult to effectively manage our global human capital. These evolving privacy and data protection requirements create uncertainty and added compliance obligations that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nClimate change laws, regulations, and impacts could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition, competitive position, and reputation.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 131 production facilities worldwide. Some of our facilities are engaged in manufacturing processes that produce greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide. We also maintain a fleet of over-the-road tractor trailers that emit greenhouse gases. Climate change has received increased attention worldwide. Many scientists, legislators, and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit such emissions. Either the enactment of, or change to existing laws and regulations, could mandate more restrictive standards or require such changes on a more accelerated time frame. Our manufacturing facilities are primarily located in North America, Europe, and Asia. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation in the jurisdictions in which we operate, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. To the extent our customers are subject to any of these or other similar proposed or newly enacted laws and regulations, additional costs by customers to comply with such laws and regulations could impact their ability to operate at similar levels in certain jurisdictions, which could adversely impact their demand for our products and services. Also, if these laws or regulations impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements on us, they could increase costs associated with our operations, including costs for raw materials and transportation. In either event, they could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition, and competitive position. Non-compliance with climate change legislative and regulatory requirements could also negatively impact our reputation.\nAlso, we have experienced, in part due to severe weather impacts, supply shortages in chemicals, which have restricted foam supply. The restriction of foam supply has constrained overall mattress production in the bedding industry and has reduced our production levels. The cost of chemicals and foam have also increased due to the shortages. If we are unable to secure an adequate supply of chemicals and foam, or the cost of these raw materials materially increases, it could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nPART I\nWe have also experienced increased property insurance premiums, in part, due to enhanced weather-related risks, but this increase in premiums has not had a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. However, a more severe impact is possible.\nIncreased scrutiny from investors, lenders, and other market participants regarding our environmental, social, and governance, or sustainability responsibilities, could expose us to additional costs or risks and adversely impact our liquidity, results of operations, reputation, employee retention, and stock price.\nInvestor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, lenders and other market participants, shareholders, and customers have focused increasingly on the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) or \u201csustainability\u201d practices of companies. These parties have placed increased importance on the implications of the social cost of their investments. If our ESG practices do not meet investor, lender, or other industry stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our access to capital may be negatively impacted based on an assessment of our ESG practices. These limitations, in both the debt and equity markets, may materially negatively affect our ability to manage our liquidity, our ability to refinance existing debt, grow our businesses, implement our strategies, our results of operations, and the price of our common stock.\nOur sustainability report details how we seek to manage our operations responsibly and ethically. The sustainability report includes our policies and practices on a variety of matters, including, but not limited to, Board and management sustainability oversight, governance and ethics, environmental compliance, employee health and safety practices, human capital management, product sustainability and stewardship, supply chain management, and workforce inclusion and diversity. In 2021, we broadened the scope of the Board\u2019s Nominating, Governance and Sustainability Committee to include oversight of our ESG programs and related risks. We also added newly created positions, including our first Chief Human Resource Officer, ID&E Director, and Sustainability Manager to help lead and evaluate our ESG practices. It is possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG practices or the speed of their adoption. In addition to the costs associated with the above mentioned positions, we could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various ESG practices. Also, our failure, or perceived failure, to meet the standards set forth in the sustainability report could negatively impact our reputation, employee retention, and the willingness of our customers and suppliers to do business with us. Our sustainability report can be found at www.leggett.com. Our website does not constitute part of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in tax laws or challenges to our tax positions pursuant to ongoing tax audits could negatively impact our earnings and cash flows.\nWe are subject to the tax laws and reporting rules of the U.S. (federal, state, and local) and several foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make these tax rules (and governmental interpretation of these rules) in any jurisdiction, including the U.S., subject to significant change and uncertainty. There have been proposals, notably by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and in the European Union, to reform tax laws or change interpretations of existing tax rules. These proposals, if adopted, could significantly impact how our earnings and transactions are taxed as a multinational corporation. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will become law, or how they might be interpreted, such changes could impact our assumptions related to the taxation of certain foreign earnings and have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows.\nWe are currently in various stages of audit by the U.S. and foreign governmental taxing authorities. We have established liabilities as we believe are appropriate, with such amounts representing what we believe is a reasonable provision for taxes that we ultimately might be required to pay. However, these liabilities could be increased over time as more information becomes known relative to the resolution of these audits, as either certain governmental tax positions may be sustained on audit or we may agree to certain tax adjustments. We could incur additional tax expense if we have adjustments higher than the liabilities recorded.\nLITIGATION RISK FACTORS\nWe are exposed to litigation contingencies that, if realized, could have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAlthough we deny liability in all currently threatened or pending litigation proceedings and believe that we have valid bases to contest all claims made against us, we have recorded an immaterial aggregate litigation contingency accrual at\nPART I\nDecember 31, 2021. Based on current facts and circumstances, aggregate reasonably possible (but not probable) losses in excess of the recorded accruals for litigation contingencies are estimated to be $10 million. If our assumptions or analyses regarding any of our contingencies are incorrect, or if facts and circumstances change, we could realize loss in excess of the recorded accruals (and in excess of the $10 million referenced above) which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. For more information regarding our legal contingencies, please see Note T on page 119 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.", "PERMNO": 60943, "SIC": 2510, "TIC": "LEG"}
