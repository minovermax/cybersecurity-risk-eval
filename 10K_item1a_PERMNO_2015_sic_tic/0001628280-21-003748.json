RISK FACTORS\nThe following discussion sets forth material risk factors that could affect our financial condition and operations:\nIndustry Factors\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely impacted and will likely continue to adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition; the ultimate impact of the pandemic on the U.S. and global economies, and on our business, results of operations and financial condition, remain uncertain\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted economic activity in the U.S., and has adversely impacted our business, results of operation and financial condition. The ultimate impact of the pandemic on the U.S. economy and our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic. Responsive actions taken by governmental and regulatory authorities to the pandemic have negatively impacted the U.S. and global economies, disrupted supply chains, created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets, and increased unemployment levels. In addition, the pandemic has significantly increased economic uncertainty, reduced economic activity, and resulted in temporary closures of many businesses and the institution of social distancing and sheltering in place requirements in many states and communities, including many markets where we have operations. We, and other financial services companies, are impacted to a significant degree by current economic conditions.\nThe economic effects of the pandemic have adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our revenue, as well as continue to result in the recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for credit losses, particularly if businesses remain closed, the impact on the global economy worsens, or more customers draw on their lines of credit or seek additional loans to help finance their businesses. We provide financing to businesses in a number of industries that may be particularly vulnerable to industry-specific economic factors that can adversely impact the performance of our commercial real estate and commercial and industrial credit portfolios. Certain of these industries, such as the retail, hospitality, aviation and energy industries, among others, have been, and can expected to continue to be, adversely impacted by the disruptive and recessionary market conditions caused by the pandemic, which could result in higher nonperforming assets for us and elevated loan charge-offs. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers, we also may be required to recognize impairments on the securities we hold.\nIn response to the pandemic, among other actions, MUB has offered payment relief options to customers that include the option to select a forbearance plan for our mortgage and home equity line of credit clients, business loan support through participation in the SBA PPP or other relief borrowing or lending programs, flexible relief programs for our consumer and business credit card clients, including payment deferral, delinquency removal and late fee waivers, and fee refunds, and waivers for our consumer and business deposit customers. The overall impact of these measures on our results of operations has been and will continue to be material and adverse. Future governmental and regulatory actions may require us to provide these and additional types of customer-related responses. Various banks, including MUB, that participated in the SBA PPP program or other relief borrowing or lending programs have or may become the subject of purported class-action or other litigation or government investigations regarding their activities under the program.\nA substantial majority of our assets, deposits and revenues are generated in California, Oregon and Washington. At the outset of the pandemic, these states issued orders generally requiring residents to shelter in place and to keep non-essential businesses closed. These states have each adopted phase-in plans for reopening with certain standards for each phase.\nWe may also experience financial losses due to operational factors, including: challenges to the availability and reliability of our network due to changes to normal operations or third party disruptions,\nincluding potential outages at network providers, call centers and other suppliers; increased cyber fraud risk related to COVID-19, given increased online banking and e-commerce; new or additional regulatory requirements, which could require additional resources and costs to address; or the inability of our work force and third-party vendors to operate from remote locations due to illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions related to the pandemic. Remote work platforms may exacerbate certain risks to our business, including an increased demand for information technology resources, increased risk of cyber attacks, and increased information security risk involving, among other risks, the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information about us, our customers or other third parties.\nEven after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of the national and global economic impact of the virus, including the availability of credit, adverse impacts on our liquidity, and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future, or litigation, enforcement, and/or investigation activity. Given the many challenges and uncertainties resulting from the pandemic, there is a risk that conditions will be substantially different than we are currently expecting. However, the effects of the pandemic can be reasonably expected to have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and heighten many of our known risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nThe governmental stimulus measures introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have increased, and can be expected to continue to increase, federal budget deficits and the national debt level, while federal, state and local tax revenue can be expected to decline along with economic activity. These events can be expected to adversely affect the long-term sovereign credit rating of United States debt, and downgrades by the credit rating agencies with respect to the obligations of the U.S. federal government could occur. Any such downgrades could increase the U.S. government\u2019s cost of borrowing, which may worsen its fiscal challenges, as well as generate upward pressure on interest rates generally, which could, in turn, have adverse consequences for our borrowers and the level of business activity. These developments could also create further challenges for MUSA\u2019s securities business, which relies upon both the credit quality of bonds issued by the U.S. federal government and the smooth functioning of the markets using such bonds as collateral, as the COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets.\nThe phase-out of LIBOR could adversely impact our business and results of operations, and the value of certain financial instruments we hold or have issued\nIn July 2017, the Chief Executive of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates the process of setting LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In November 2020, LIBOR\u2019s administrator, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (IBA) announced that it will consult on its intention to cease the publication of the one week and two month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings as of the end of 2021 and the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR settings as of June 30, 2023. The FCA and the U.S. bank regulators concurrently expressed their support of this proposal, indicating that the June 30, 2023, cessation date would allow time for legacy contracts executed before January 1, 2022 to mature. The U.S. bank regulators also encouraged banks to stop entering into LIBOR-based contracts by the end of 2021.\nThe phase-out of LIBOR creates a broad range of risks and challenges (including financial, operational, legal, reputational, compliance and market risks) for the banking industry and could adversely impact our businesses and results of operations, and the value of certain financial instruments originated or held by us that use LIBOR as a reference rate. LIBOR is used as a reference rate for many of our transactions, including derivatives and other contracts used for hedging and trading account purposes, loans to commercial customers and consumers (including mortgage loans and other loans), and long-term borrowings. For additional information, see \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Market Risk Management - LIBOR Transition\u201d in Part II, Item 7. in this Form 10-K.\nThere are ongoing efforts to establish an alternative reference rate. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (or SOFR) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is considered a likely alternative reference rate suitable for replacing LIBOR and similar benchmarks. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of overnight borrowings collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. As a result, the scope of its ultimate\nacceptance and the impact on rates, pricing and the ability to manage risk, including through derivatives, remain uncertain.\nEven if SOFR or another reference rate ultimately replaces LIBOR, risks and challenges will remain for us with respect to outstanding loans, derivatives or other instruments using LIBOR, which will need to be transitioned to a new reference rate that is unlikely to exactly track, or produce the economic equivalent of, LIBOR. Risks related to transitioning instruments to a new reference rate or to how LIBOR is calculated and its availability are likely to vary by asset class and contract and will require considerable effort and expense to renegotiate contracts for outstanding financial assets and liabilities and include impacts on the yield on loans or securities held by us, amounts paid on securities we have issued, or amounts received and paid on derivative instruments we have entered into. While some of our existing products or contracts include fallback provisions to alternative reference rates, other products or contracts may not include adequate fallback provisions and may require consent of all parties to any modification. The market transition from LIBOR and similar benchmarks could adversely affect the return on and pricing, liquidity and value of our outstanding products and contracts, cause market dislocations, increase the cost of and access to capital and increase the risk of disputes and litigation, including in connection with the interpretation and enforceability of our outstanding products and contracts.\nDifficult market conditions adversely affect the U.S. banking industry\nEconomic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets have adversely affected our business, financial condition and results of operations and could do so again. Turbulent political and economic conditions in foreign countries and trade policy differences with major U.S. trading partners may negatively impact the U.S. financial markets and economy in general. Additionally, global markets may be adversely affected by natural disasters, widespread health emergencies or pandemics, cyber attacks, military conflict, terrorism or other geopolitical events. In particular, we may face the following risks in connection with these events:\n\u2022Our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties may be impaired if the methods and approaches we use to select, manage, and underwrite our customers and counterparties become less predictive of future behaviors.\n\u2022We may not be able to accurately estimate credit exposure losses because the process we use to estimate these losses requires difficult, subjective, and complex judgments which may not be amenable to precise estimates.\n\u2022Our ability to borrow from other financial institutions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations.\n\u2022Downgrades in the credit ratings of major U.S. or foreign banks or other financial difficulties affecting such major banks could have adverse consequences for the financial markets generally, including possible negative effects on the available sources of market liquidity and increased pricing pressures in such markets which, in turn, could make it more difficult or expensive for banks generally and for us to access such markets.\n\u2022Significant fluctuations in the prices of equity and fixed income securities could adversely impact our asset management and trust businesses. MUSA is exposed to the price risk of such securities where it holds inventory to meet expected customer demand. MUSA's debt capital markets fee income would also be detrimentally impacted from sustained periods of fixed income price volatility. MUB's fee income may also decline since its asset management and trust business fees are primarily based on the values of assets it manages, and declines in those asset values reduces the amount of fees charged.\n\u2022We may incur goodwill impairment losses in future periods. See \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Goodwill Impairment Analysis\u201d in Part II, Item 7. and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\n\u2022Given the inter-connectivity of the global economy, pandemic disease and health events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have the potential to negatively impact economic activities in many countries, including the U.S., with consequent adverse effects on our customers and business.\n\u2022Acts or threats of terrorism and actions taken by the U.S. or other governments as a result of such acts or threats and other international hostilities have the potential to disrupt global and U.S. economic activity with consequent adverse effects on our business.\nThe effects of changes or increases in, or supervisory enforcement of, banking, securities, competition or other laws and regulations or governmental fiscal, monetary, or tax policies could adversely affect us or make strategic planning more difficult\nWe are subject to extensive federal and state regulation, supervision and legislation that governs almost all aspects of our operations. These laws and regulations are intended primarily for the benefit and protection of our depositors and other customers, and the FDIC and the banking system as a whole, and less so for the benefit or protection of investors in our securities. In the past, our business has been materially affected by these regulations. We expect this will continue in the future. Laws or regulations, including accounting standards and interpretations, currently affecting us and our subsidiaries may change over time. Regulatory authorities may change their interpretation of, and intensify their examination of compliance with, these regulations. Therefore, our business may be adversely affected by changes in laws, regulations, or interpretations or regulatory approaches to compliance and enforcement. Changes in laws and regulations may also increase our expenses by imposing additional supervision, fees, taxes or restrictions on our operations. Compliance with laws and regulations, especially new laws and regulations, increases our operating expenses and may require additional management time and attention. To the extent state and local laws and regulations are not preempted by federal laws or regulations, our regulatory compliance could become more challenging.\nWe maintain systems and procedures designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Some legal and regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of criminal or civil penalties (which can be substantial) for noncompliance. In some cases, liability may attach even if the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even if reasonably designed compliance systems and procedures were in place. There may be other negative consequences from a finding of noncompliance, including restrictions on certain activities and damage to our reputation. Legal or regulatory compliance failure may also adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approvals for future strategic initiatives. Furthermore, failure to take necessary corrective action or the discovery of other violations of laws in the process of implementing any corrective measures could result in further regulatory sanctions.\nReform of the financial services industry resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act enacted in 2010 and EGRRCPA, signed into law in May 2018 which amended various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, have affected U.S. financial institutions, including us, in many ways, some of which have increased, or may increase in the future, the cost of doing business and present other challenges. For additional information, see \"Supervision and Regulation - Dodd-Frank Act and Related Regulations\" in Part I, Item 1. \"Business\" in this Form 10-K.\nThe need to maintain more and higher quality capital and greater liquidity under applicable bank regulatory agency rules could limit the Company\u2019s lending and other business activities and its ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. It could also result in the Company taking steps to increase its capital or being limited in its ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to its shareholders, or selling or refraining from acquiring assets. In addition, the regulatory liquidity standards could limit the Company\u2019s ability to invest in longer-term or less liquid assets even if more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective.\nOur business is affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the U.S. federal government and its agencies. We are particularly affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. Under federal law, a BHC is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks. As a result, we may be required to commit financial and other resources to our subsidiary bank in circumstances where we might not otherwise do so. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve can be expected to have a material effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. For additional information regarding the impact of the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policies on interest rates and our net interest margin, see \u201cFluctuations in interest rates on loans and deposits could adversely affect our business\u201d below in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Refer to\n\"Supervision and Regulation\" in Part I, Item 1. \"Business\" in this Form 10-K for discussion of certain additional existing and proposed laws and regulations that may affect our business.\nIncreased regulation of the financial services industry has required and can be expected to continue to require significant investments in technology, personnel or other resources. Our competitors may be subject to different or reduced regulation due to their asset size or types of products offered and may also be able to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations and to more efficiently absorb increased regulatory compliance costs into their cost structures.\nHigher credit losses could require us to increase our allowance for credit losses resulting in a charge to earnings\nWhen we loan money or commit to loan money, we incur credit risk or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans. We reserve for credit losses by establishing an allowance for credit losses through a charge to earnings. The allowance amount is based on an estimate of the credit losses that are expected over the life of the loan or unfunded credit commitment. The process for determining the allowance amount is critical to our financial results and condition. It requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the future impact of current economic conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans.\nThe need to account for assets at market prices may adversely affect our results of operations\nWe report certain assets, including securities, at fair value. Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value, we use quoted market prices or valuation models that utilize market data inputs and assumptions to estimate that value. Because generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. require fair value measurements to reflect appropriate adjustments for risks related to liquidity and the use of unobservable assumptions, we may recognize unrealized losses even if we believe that the asset in question presents minimal credit risk. During periods of adverse conditions in the capital markets, we may be required to recognize impairments with respect to securities in our investment portfolio and such conditions could also result in mark-to-market losses in our trading portfolios at MUSA.\nFluctuations in interest rates on loans and deposits could adversely affect our business\nSignificant increases in market interest rates on loans or other fixed income investments, or the perception that an increase may occur, could adversely affect our loan and investment portfolios, our ability to originate new loans and our ability to grow. An increase in market interest rates could adversely affect the ability of our floating-rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations and could result in an increase in nonperforming assets and charge-offs. Conversely, decreases in interest rates could result in an acceleration of loan prepayments that could negatively affect our profitability. Increases in interest rates could also diminish the flow of corporate debt offerings in the securities markets generally and adversely impact the investment banking business of MUSA which is dependent on the sales of debt securities issued by its customers.\nChanges in market interest rates on deposits or other funding sources, including changes in the relationship between short-term and long-term market interest rates or between different interest rate indices, can impact, and has in past years impacted, our net interest margin (that is, the difference between the interest rates we charge on interest earning assets, such as loans, and the interest rates we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits or other borrowings). This impact could result in a decrease in our interest income relative to interest expense. In 2020, as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate dramatically (to .00 to .25 percent) and has indicated that such low rates can be expected to continue for the next several years. The long-term impact of these measures on the U.S. economy and financial markets cannot be predicted with certainty at this time. For additional information, see \"Supervision and Regulation\" in Part I, Item 1. \"Business\" in this Form 10-K.\nOur deposit customers may pursue alternatives to bank deposits or seek higher yielding deposits, which may increase our funding costs and adversely affect our liquidity position\nChecking and savings account balances and other forms of deposits can decrease when our deposit customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, other non-depository investments or higher yielding deposits, as providing superior expected returns or as being more secure. Technology and other changes have made it more convenient for bank customers to transfer funds into alternative investments or other deposit accounts, including products offered by other financial institutions or non-bank service providers. Future increases in short-term interest rates could increase such transfers of deposits to higher-yielding deposits or other investments either with us or with other providers. These consumer preferences may force us to pay higher interest rates or reduce fees to retain certain deposits and may constrain liquidity as we seek to meet funding needs caused by reduced deposit levels.\nIf interest rates rise from the historically low levels of recent years, our deposits may not be as stable or as interest rate insensitive as similar deposits may have been in the past and, if the expansion of the U.S. economy resumes after the pandemic subsides, some existing or prospective deposit customers of banks generally, including MUB, may be inclined to pursue other investment alternatives.\nEfforts and initiatives we undertake to retain and increase deposits, including deposit pricing, can increase our costs. When bank customers move money out of deposits in favor of alternative investments or into higher-yielding deposits, we can lose a relatively inexpensive source of funds, increasing our funding cost. As our assets grow, we may face increasing pressure to seek new deposits through expanded channels from new customers at unfavorable pricing, further increasing our costs.\nSubstantial competition could adversely affect us; and there are an increasing number of non-bank competitors providing financial services\nBanking is a highly competitive business. We compete actively for loan, deposit, and other financial services business in the West Coast states as well as nationally and internationally. Our competitors include financial and non-financial services firms, such as traditional banks, online banks, financial technology companies and others. Competition in our industry may further intensify as a result of the recent and increasing level of consolidation of financial services companies. Larger financial institutions may have greater access to capital at a lower cost than ours, which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. In addition, some of our current commercial banking customers may seek alternative banking sources if they develop credit needs larger than we may be able to accommodate. Many of our non-bank competitors have lower overhead costs and are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern our activities and may have greater flexibility in competing for business. Additionally, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and payment systems. If consumers and small businesses do not use banks for their financial transactions, we could potentially lose interest and fee income, deposits and income generated from those deposits and other financial transactions. We also experience competition, especially for deposits, from internet-based banking institutions and other financial companies, which do not always have a physical presence in our market footprint and have grown rapidly.\nCompany Factors\nAdverse economic factors affecting certain industries we serve could adversely affect our business\nWe provide financing to businesses in a number of industries that may be particularly vulnerable to industry-specific economic factors that can adversely impact the performance of our commercial real estate and commercial and industrial credit portfolios. The commercial real estate industry in the U.S., and in California in particular, has been impacted in the past by adverse economic markets and could be adversely impacted by the current pandemic. The home building and mortgage industries in California also were especially adversely impacted by the deterioration in residential real estate markets. Our commercial and industrial credit portfolio, and the communications and media, retail, and energy industries in particular, were also adversely impacted by recessionary market conditions and other emerging developments that are disruptive to their customary business models. Poor economic conditions and financial access for commercial\nreal estate developers and homebuilders could adversely affect property values, resulting in higher nonperforming assets and charge-offs in this sector.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is related to residential real estate, especially in California. Increases in residential mortgage loan interest rates could have an adverse effect on our operations by depressing new mortgage loan originations, and could negatively impact our title and escrow deposit levels. California markets have experienced a strong recovery in home prices since the post-2008 housing market crisis. A renewed downturn could have an adverse effect on our operations and the quality of our real estate loan portfolio. These factors could adversely impact the quality of our residential construction and residential mortgage portfolios in various ways, including by decreasing the value of the collateral for our mortgage loans. These factors could also negatively affect the economy in general and thereby our overall loan portfolio.\nMUSA provides financing through repurchase transactions to mortgage real estate investment trusts (REITs) collateralized by U.S. agency-backed mortgages held by such trusts. MUSA also has established a trading business in U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities. A down-turn in the real estate sector in the U.S. could adversely impact the creditworthiness of these mortgage REITs and could adversely impact MUSA\u2019s business and results of operations.\nIndustry-specific risks are beyond our control and could adversely affect our loan portfolio, potentially resulting in an increase in nonperforming loans or charge-offs and a slowing of growth or reduction in our loan portfolio.\nCalifornia economic conditions, have been, and can reasonably be expected to continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which could adversely affect our business\nA substantial majority of our assets, deposits and revenue is generated in California. As a result, poor economic conditions in California may cause us to incur losses associated with higher loan default rates and decreased collateral values in our loan portfolio. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the California state government has taken a number of actions and instituted restrictions on economic and social activities, which continue to be updated with the changing conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic uncertainty, reduced economic activity and increased unemployment levels, especially in California. The various economic and health measures introduced by the State of California in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have increased state spending at a time when the current economic slowdown can be expected to result in reduced state tax revenues, perhaps for a prolonged period.\nIn recent years, municipalities and other governmental units in California have experienced budgetary difficulties and several California municipalities filed for protection under the Bankruptcy Code. As a result, concerns have arisen regarding the outlook for the governmental obligations of California municipalities and other governmental units. If the budgetary and fiscal difficulties of the California state government and California municipalities and other governmental units recur or economic conditions in California significantly decline, we expect that our problem assets could increase and our prospects for growth could be impaired.\nFor a number of years in the past decade, California has also experienced severe drought, wildfires or other natural disasters. It can be expected that these events will continue to occur from time to time in the areas served by MUB, and that the consequences of these natural disasters, including programs of public utility public safety power outages when weather conditions and fire danger warrant, may adversely affect MUB\u2019s business and that of its customers. It is also possible that climate change may be increasing the severity or frequency of adverse weather conditions, thus increasing the impact of these types of natural disasters on our business and that of our customers.\nOur credit ratings are important in order to maintain liquidity; our credit ratings could be adversely affected by negative changes in the credit ratings of our parent companies\nCredit rating agencies regularly evaluate and provide credit ratings of the securities of MUAH and the securities and deposits of MUB and also provide entity ratings for MUAH, MUB and MUSA. These ratings are based on a number of factors including our financial strength, ability to generate earnings, and other factors,\nsome of which are not entirely within our control, such as conditions affecting the financial services industry and the economy. Additionally, changes in the credit ratings, operations, financial condition or prospects of our parent companies, MUFG Bank, Ltd. and MUFG, could also adversely impact our credit ratings. No assurance can be given that we will maintain our current ratings. Further, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and concerns over its financial impacts on the U.S. and global economies and the credit effects on companies, credit rating agencies continue to reevaluate and revise the outlook or credit ratings for many companies, including MUAH, which could result in a negative ratings action or downgrade.\nIf our long-term or short-term credit ratings suffer substantial downgrades, particularly if lowered below investment grade, such downgrades could adversely affect access to liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds (especially our wholesale funding), trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of commercial depositors, investors and counterparties willing or permitted to lend to us or enter into derivative transactions with us, thereby curtailing our business operations and reducing our ability to generate income. For additional information, see \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management - Liquidity Risk Management\" in Part II, Item 7. of this Form 10-K.\nOur stockholder votes are controlled by MUFG Bank, Ltd. and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc.\nMUFG Bank, Ltd., and MUFG own all of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, MUFG Bank, Ltd. and MUFG can elect all of our directors and can control the vote on all matters, including: approval of business combinations; a sale of all or substantially all of our assets; issuance of any additional common stock or other equity or debt securities; incurring debt other than in the ordinary course of business; the selection and tenure of our Chief Executive Officer; payment of dividends with respect to our common stock or other equity securities; and other matters that might be favorable to MUFG Bank, Ltd. or MUFG.\nA majority of our directors are independent of MUFG and MUFG Bank, Ltd. and are not officers or employees of MUAH or any of our affiliates, including MUFG or MUFG Bank, Ltd. However, because of our parents' control over the election of our directors, they could at any time change the composition of our Board of Directors so that it would not have a majority of independent directors.\nWe could be adversely affected by the regulatory condition of MUFG Bank, Ltd. or MUFG, litigation affecting them or conflicts of interest with our parents\nAdverse changes in the regulatory condition or litigation affecting our parents could adversely affect us, due to the reputational impact of such matters or in other ways. MUFG Bank, Ltd. and MUFG are subject to regulatory oversight, review and supervisory action (which can include fines or penalties) by Japanese, U.S. and other regulatory authorities. Our business operations and expansion plans could be negatively affected by regulatory concerns or supervisory action any such authority might take against MUFG Bank, Ltd. or MUFG.\nThe views of MUFG Bank, Ltd. and MUFG regarding customers, new businesses, strategies, acquisitions, divestitures or other initiatives, including compliance and risk management, may differ from ours. This may prevent or hinder us from pursuing individual initiatives or cause us to incur additional costs and subject us to additional oversight. MUSA receives a significant portion of its business from referrals from our parents and their affiliated entities. If such referrals diminish, this could materially adversely impact MUSA\u2019s business.\nMUFG Bank, Ltd.\u2019s risk management processes manage global credit and other types of exposures and concentrations on an aggregate basis, including exposures and concentrations at MUAH or its subsidiaries. Therefore, at certain levels or in certain circumstances, our ability to approve certain credits, other banking transactions, or certain customers is subject to the concurrence of MUFG Bank, Ltd. We may wish to extend credit or furnish other banking services to the same customers as MUFG Bank, Ltd. Our ability to do so may be limited for various reasons, including MUFG Bank, Ltd.\u2019s aggregate exposure and marketing policies.\nSince MUB, MUSA, MUAH and MUFG Bank, Ltd. all compete in U.S. banking or investment banking markets, ownership interests in MUFG\u2019s common stock held by certain of our directors or officers, or services provided by those individuals to MUFG Bank, Ltd. or MUFG, could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest. A number of the executive officers of MUAH and MUB also serve as executive officers of MUFG Bank, Ltd.\u2019s U.S. branch operations, which could increase or appear to increase potential conflicts of interests with our parents. While the corporate governance policies adopted by MUAH, MUB, MUSA, MUFG and MUFG Bank, Ltd. address potential conflicts of interest, there can be no assurance that these policies will prevent conflicts of interest which may have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe rely on third parties for important products and services\nThird-party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections, network access and mutual fund distribution and, although we monitor their performance, we do not control their actions. Third-party vendors have played and will continue to play a key role in the implementation of our technology enhancement and replacement projects, including our Transformation and Rewiring Programs. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly or failing to meet legal and regulatory requirements, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers, implement our technology enhancement and replacement projects or otherwise conduct our business, and also could result in disputes with such vendors over the performance of their services to us, as well as adverse regulatory consequences for us. Replacing these third-party vendors on economically feasible terms may not always be possible or within our control and could also entail significant delay and expense. In recent years, there has been consolidation in the number of major vendors supporting financial institutions such as MUB, resulting in increased concentration risk for such institutions. This risk could be increased if the COVID-19 pandemic results in failures or additional combinations of such vendors.\nRestrictions on dividends and other distributions could limit amounts payable to us\nAs a holding company, a portion of our cash flow comes from dividends our bank and non-bank subsidiaries pay to us. Various regulations restrict the amount of dividends MUB can pay to us without prior regulatory approval. MUSA is also subject to regulatory net capital rules which limit its ability to pay dividends. In addition, if any of our subsidiaries were to liquidate, that subsidiary\u2019s creditors will be entitled to receive distributions from the assets of that subsidiary to satisfy their claims against it before we, as a holder of an equity interest in the subsidiary, will be entitled to receive any of the assets of the subsidiary.\nRisks from potential acquisitions, divestitures, integrations or restructurings may adversely affect us\nWe have in the past sought, and may in the future seek, to expand our business by acquiring other businesses. There can be no assurance that our acquisitions will have the anticipated positive results, including results related to: the total cost of integration; the retention of key personnel; the time required to complete the integration; the amount of longer-term cost savings; or the overall performance of the acquired company or combined entity. We also may encounter difficulties in obtaining required regulatory approvals due to operational limitations, regulatory restrictions on our own activities, or other reasons. Unexpected contingent liabilities can arise from the businesses we acquire. Acquisitions may also lead us to enter geographic and product markets in which we have limited or no direct experience. Further, the asset quality or other financial characteristics of a business or assets we may acquire may deteriorate after an acquisition closes, which could result in impairment or other expenses and charges which would reduce our operating results.\nIn addition, we continue to evaluate the performance of all of our businesses and may sell or restructure one or more of them. Any divestitures or restructurings may result in significant expenses and write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and may involve additional risks, including difficulties in obtaining any required regulatory approvals, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees.\nIncreasing regulation of data privacy could adversely affect our business\nLaws and regulations related to data privacy and data security are increasing, as Federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing the collection, processing, storage, use, and security of personal and confidential information. Further, these laws and regulations are aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes in some cases. Laws and regulations designed to protect the privacy and security of customer information apply to us and our subsidiaries. These laws limit the handling and sharing of data. Our business model relies, in part, upon cross-marketing the products and services offered by us and our subsidiaries to our customers. Laws that restrict our ability to share information about customers between our affiliated companies or impose additional compliance costs could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. For additional discussion, see \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1. \"Business\" in this Form 10-K.\nOn January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the \u201cCCPA\u201d) became effective. This law provides consumers with expansive rights and control over their personal information which is obtained by or shared with \u201ccovered businesses\u201d (which includes MUB and most other banking institutions subject to California law). The CCPA gives consumers the right to request disclosure of information collected about them and whether that information has been sold or shared with others, the right to request deletion of personal information subject to certain exceptions, the right to opt out of the sale of the consumer\u2019s personal information and the right not to be discriminated against because of choices regarding the consumer\u2019s personal information.\nIn November 2020, California voters approved state-wide Proposition 24, also known as the California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act of 2020 (the \u201cCPREA\u201d) which expanded and amended certain provisions of the CCPA and created the California Privacy Protection Agency to enforce privacy rights for Californians and impose fines for violations of such rights. The CPREA requires businesses to not share a consumer\u2019s personal information upon the consumer\u2019s request, provides consumers with an opt-out option for having their sensitive personal information used or disclosed for advertising or marketing, to obtain permission for collecting data on certain minors, and to correct a consumer\u2019s inaccurate information upon the consumer\u2019s request. It also removed the ability of businesses to remedy violations before being penalized for violations and increased the penalties for such violations. Most of the provisions of the CPREA will take effect in 2023 but some portions, such as the creation of the new state agency, will go into effect immediately. The impact of these laws on the business of MUB is yet to be determined, but they could result in increased operating expenses as well as additional exposure to the risk of litigation by or on behalf of consumers. It is possible that other states where we have customers could enact similar laws. For additional information, see \u201cSupervision and Regulation - Other Federal Laws and Regulations Affecting Banks - Privacy\u201d in Part I, Item 1. \"Business\" in this Form 10-K.\nOur business could suffer if we fail to attract, develop, retain and successfully integrate skilled personnel\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. Any of our current employees, including our senior management, may terminate their employment with us at any time. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry can be intense. We may not be successful in attracting, developing and retaining sufficient qualified personnel. We may also incur increased expenses and be required to divert the attention of other senior executives to recruit replacements for the loss of any key or other personnel. We may experience turnover among members of management and must successfully integrate any new management personnel into the organization to achieve our operating objectives as new management becomes familiar with our business.\nWe need to effectively integrate technological change to maintain and enhance our competitive position; our current technological and other operational initiatives may strain our available resources\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological change which includes the introduction of new products and services based on new or enhanced technologies. Examples include cloud computing, artificial intelligence and machine learning, biometric authentication and data protection enhancements, as well as increased online and mobile device interaction with customers. We have been\ninvesting in technology to facilitate the ability of our customers to engage in financial transactions and for many other purposes, including our Transformation Program (see \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Overview\u201d in Part II, Item 7. in this Form 10-K). The maintenance of our competitive position depends, in part, upon our ability to meet the needs of our customers through the application of new technologies. If we fail to maintain or enhance our competitive position with regard to technology, whether because we fail to anticipate customer needs and expectations or because our technological initiatives fail to perform as desired or are not timely implemented, we may lose market share or incur additional expense.\nIn addition to our technology programs and initiatives, there are a number of other operational and other initiatives which require our attention and resources. These include implementation of our Rewiring Program (see \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Overview\u201d in Part II, Item 7. in this Form 10-K), various other regulatory or strategic initiatives, and integration of new employees and key management personnel. Our ability to execute our core operations and to implement technology and other important initiatives may be adversely affected if our resources are insufficient or if we are unable to allocate available resources effectively.\nSignificant legal or regulatory proceedings could subject us to adverse financial and reputational risks\nWe are from time to time subject to claims and proceedings related to our present or previous operations including claims by customers, our current or former employees and our contractual counterparties. These claims, which could include supervisory or enforcement actions by bank regulatory and other authorities, or criminal proceedings by prosecutorial authorities, could involve demands for large monetary amounts, including civil money penalties or fines imposed by government authorities, and significant defense costs. Such claims also can divert the attention of senior management. We may be exposed to substantial liabilities which could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, reputation and financial condition.\nOur effective tax rates and our future results can also be affected by our participation for state income tax purposes as a member of MUFG\u2019s unitary group in the U.S. and by other factors\nUnder a tax election we have made, we are required to file our California franchise tax returns as a member of a unitary group that includes MUFG\u2019s U.S. operations, including its U.S. branches and other affiliates. Increases or decreases in the taxable profits of MUFG\u2019s U.S. operations could increase or decrease our effective tax rate for California state income tax purposes. We review MUFG\u2019s financial information on a quarterly basis to determine the rate at which to recognize our California income taxes. However, all of the information relevant to determining the effective California tax rate may not be available until after the end of the period to which the tax relates, primarily due to MUFG\u2019s March 31 fiscal year-end. Our California effective tax rate can change during the calendar year or between calendar years as additional information becomes available. We could be subject to penalties and interest if we understate our tax obligations. Our effective tax rates for both federal and state income tax purposes also could be affected by valuation changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or their interpretations and by the outcomes of examinations of our income tax returns by tax authorities.\nWe are subject to a wide array of operational risks\nWe are subject to many types of operational risks throughout our organization. Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events, that do not fall into the market risk or credit risk categories described in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management\u201d in Part II, Item 7. of this Form 10-K. Operational risk includes execution risk related to operational initiatives, such as implementation of our technology enhancement and replacement projects, including our Transformation and Rewiring Programs, increased reliance on internally developed models for risk and finance management and compliance, including models associated with regulatory capital requirements, the pricing of various products, grading loans, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting losses, and other activities and risks; the risk of fraud or theft by employees, customers or outsiders; unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled\ncomputer or telecommunications systems; and operational risks related to use of third party service providers. To the extent that any such models which we use are not correctly designed or are poorly implemented, our business could be at risk and information we furnish to the public or regulators could be rendered inaccurate or misleading, which, in turn, could have adverse consequences for our regulatory relations and public perceptions of our Company. A discussion of risks associated with regulatory compliance appears above in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d under the caption \u201cThe effects of changes or increases in, or supervisory enforcement of, banking, securities, competition or other laws and regulations or governmental fiscal, monetary, or tax policies could adversely affect us or make strategic planning more difficult\u201d.\nWe depend on the continued efficacy of our data management and governance policies, technical systems, operational infrastructure, relationships with third parties and our employees in our day-to-day and ongoing operations. Our increasing dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions may further increase the risk that technical system flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect or data which are not reliable. We are also exposed to the risk that, notwithstanding our data management and governance policies, data in our system may become corrupted, inaccurate or out-of-date, any of which can impair the integrity of our decision-making processes. With regard to the physical infrastructure that supports our operations, we have taken measures to implement backup systems and other safeguards, but our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any disruption to that infrastructure. Failures in our internal control or operational systems, security breaches or service interruptions, or those of our third-party service providers could impair our ability to operate our business and result in potential liability to customers, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, any of which could harm our operating results and financial condition. Although we carefully review the risk management standards and processes of our third-party service providers, there can be no assurance that the risk management efforts of our providers will be successful in preventing all cybersecurity incidents.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage, transmission and reporting of personal, confidential and other sensitive information or data in our computer systems, networks and business applications. Our systems as well as our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to cyber attacks, breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have significant negative consequences to us. The various forms of cyber attacks or other information security breaches are referred to herein as \u201ccybersecurity incidents\u201d. Such cybersecurity incidents could result in interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or our customers\u2019 operations; interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information and data; or processing of unauthorized transactions or loss of funds. These events could result in litigation, government investigation activity, regulatory enforcement actions, and /or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered by our insurance or result in regulatory consequences or reputational harm, any of which could harm our competitive position, operating results and financial condition. We maintain cyber insurance, but this insurance may not cover all costs associated with cybersecurity incidents or the consequences of personal or confidential information being compromised. These types of incidents can remain undetected for extended periods of time, thereby increasing the associated risks. We may also be required to expend significant resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or exposures arising from cybersecurity risks.\nWe may also be subject to disruptions of our business from external events such as power, internet and communications outages, natural disasters (such as earthquakes or wildfires) and terrorist attacks. While we maintain business recovery plans, they may not work as intended.\nOur business and operations are subject to a wide array of cybersecurity risks\nLike other financial institutions, we have been the target of various denial-of-service or other cybersecurity incidents (including attempts to inject malicious code and viruses into computer systems) as part of what appears to be a coordinated effort to disrupt the operations of financial institutions and potentially test their cybersecurity in advance of future and more advanced cybersecurity incidents. These cybersecurity incidents originate from a variety of sophisticated sources who may be involved with organized crime, linked to terrorist organizations or hostile countries and have extensive resources to disrupt our operations or the financial system more generally. The potential for denial-of-service and other cybersecurity incidents requires substantial resources to defend and may affect customer satisfaction and behavior. To date, we have not\nexperienced any material losses relating to cybersecurity incidents, but there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses or information security breaches in the future. A successful cybersecurity incident could result in a material disruption of our operations, exposure of confidential information and financial loss to us, our clients, customers and counterparties and could lead to significant exposure to litigation, government investigations, and/or regulatory fines, penalties and other sanctions as well as reputational damage. While we have a variety of cybersecurity measures in place, the consequences to our business of such cybersecurity incidents cannot be predicted with any certainty.\nIn addition, there have been increasing efforts on the part of cyber criminals to breach data security at financial institutions and other companies, such as large retailers, including through the use of social engineering schemes such as \u201cphishing.\u201d The ability of our customers to bank remotely, including online and through mobile devices, requires secure transmissions of confidential information and increases the risk of data security breaches which would expose us to claims by customers or others and could adversely affect our reputation and could lead to a material loss. A breach or failure of our information systems or controls could lead to the unauthorized release or loss or destruction of personal or confidential information about our customers, employees or other third parties in our possession. There has also been a significant increase in consumer information available on the internet arising from breaches of third-party entities. This can create a vulnerability for our customers if their log-in credentials at the Bank are the same or similar to those that have been compromised on other sites, including the risk of illicit account access, data loss and fraud. Even if cybersecurity incidents are not directed specifically at MUB or our third-party service providers, such attacks on other large financial institutions could disrupt the overall functioning of the financial system and undermine consumer confidence in banks generally, to the detriment of other financial institutions, including MUB. For additional information regarding our obligations to provide for the security of our customers' data, see \"Supervision and Regulation - Other Federal and State Laws and Regulations Affecting Banks - Customer Information Security\" and \"Privacy\" in Part I, Item 1. \"Business\" in this Form 10-K.\nWe, and other banking institutions, are also at risk of increased losses from fraudulent conduct of criminals or criminal organizations using increasingly sophisticated techniques. This criminal activity is taking many forms, including debit/credit card fraud, check fraud, mechanical devices affixed to ATM\u2019s, phishing attacks to obtain personal information, or impersonation of customers through falsified or stolen credentials, or business email compromise. We, and other banking institutions, are also at risk of fraudulent or criminal activities by employees, contractors, vendors and others with whom we do business. There is also the risk of errors by our employees and others responsible for the systems and controls on which we depend and any resulting failures of these systems and controls could significantly harm our Company.\nUnder the applicable Federal regulatory guidance, financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate the identity of customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to a cybersecurity incident. Failure to observe this regulatory guidance could subject us to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. Additionally, our business recovery plan may not work as intended or may not prevent significant interruptions of our operations. Any such event could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. Further, as cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to apply substantial additional resources to modify or enhance our systems, investigate and remediate any cyber vulnerabilities or incidents and develop our ability to respond and recover.\nThe risks associated with cybersecurity are also increasing due to the proliferation of new technologies and the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions.\nNegative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact our business and revenues\nAs a financial institution, our business and revenues are subject to risks associated with negative public opinion. Negative public opinion about us could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including our lending practices, the failure of any product or service we provide to meet our customers\u2019 expectations or applicable regulatory requirements, governmental enforcement actions, corporate governance deficiencies, business acquisitions, use of social media, cybersecurity breaches or from actions taken by regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to keep, attract and retain lending, deposit and other customers and employees and can expose us to claims, litigation, government investigations and/or regulatory actions, as well as increased liquidity risk. Actual or alleged misconduct by one of our businesses can result in negative public opinion about our other businesses.\nOur framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to the Company\nOur risk management framework is made up of various processes and strategies to manage and mitigate our risk exposure. Types of risk to which we are subject include liquidity risk, credit risk, market and investment risk, interest rate risk, operational risk (including, but not limited to, information and model risk), legal risk, compliance risk, reputation risk, fiduciary risk, counterparty risk and strategic risk (including risks to our financial position and resilience arising from adverse business decisions or poorly implemented decisions or lack of responsiveness to industry changes and the operating environment), among others. Our framework to manage risk, including its underlying assumptions, such as our modeling methodologies, may not be effective under all conditions and circumstances. In our industry\u2019s complex and rapidly evolving operating environment, certain risks, especially operational risk and strategic risk, can present significant challenges to our risk management framework. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected and there also could be consequent adverse regulatory implications in any such event.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms. Any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nOur financial results depend on management\u2019s selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Certain accounting policies are critical to presenting our financial condition and results. They require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. These critical accounting policies include allowance for credit losses, transfer pricing, goodwill impairment analysis and income taxes. Because of the uncertainty of estimates involved in deciding these matters, we may be required to significantly increase or decrease the allowance for credit losses, sustain loan losses that are significantly different than the reserve provided, recognize significant impairment on goodwill, or significantly increase or decrease our accrued tax liability. Any one or more of these actions could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 20694, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "0176A"}
