{"cik": "94845", "company": "LEVI STRAUSS & CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-05", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain the value and reputation of our brands.\nOur success depends in large part on the value and reputation of our brands, which are integral to our business and the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business. Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brands will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide consistent, high-quality products. Our brands and reputation could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives, if we fail to deliver high- quality products acceptable to our customers and consumers or if we face a product recall.\nOur brand value also depends on our ability to maintain a positive consumer perception of our corporate integrity and culture. Negative claims or publicity involving us or our products, or the production methods of any of our suppliers or contract manufacturers, could seriously damage our reputation and brand image, regardless of whether such claims or publicity are accurate. Social media, which accelerates and potentially amplifies the scope of negative claims or publicity, can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims or publicity. In addition, we may from time to time take positions on social issues that may be unpopular with some customers or potential customers, which may impact our ability to attract or retain such customers. Adverse publicity could undermine consumer confidence in our brands and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if such publicity is unfounded. Any harm to our brands and reputation could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe depend on a group of key wholesale customers for a significant portion of our revenues. A significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in a customer's performance or financial position could harm our business and financial condition.\nSales to our top ten wholesale customers accounted for 27%, 28% and 30% of our total net revenues in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. No single customer represented 10% or more of our net revenues in any of these years. While we have long-standing relationships with our wholesale customers, we do not have long-term contracts with them. As a result, purchases generally occur on an order-by-order basis, and the relationship, as well as particular orders, can generally be terminated by either party at any time. If any major wholesale customer decreases or ceases its purchases from us, cancels its orders, reduces the floor space, assortments, fixtures or advertising for our products or changes its manner of doing business with us for any reason, such actions could adversely affect our business and financial condition. In addition, a decline in the performance or financial condition of a major wholesale customer - including bankruptcy or liquidation - could result in a material loss of revenues to us and cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer, require us to assume more credit risk relating to our receivables from that customer or limit our ability to collect amounts related to previous purchases by that customer. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and financial condition. For example, in October 2018, our wholesale customer, Sears Holdings Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries, including Kmart, filed for federal bankruptcy protection and announced plans to close unprofitable stores. These developments will likely adversely affect our sales to this customer, even if it continues operations.\nThe retail industry in the United States has experienced substantial consolidation over the last decade, and further consolidation may occur. In particular, consumers have continued to transition away from traditional wholesale retailers to large online retailers, where our products are exposed to increased competition. Consolidation in the retail industry has typically resulted in store closures, centralized purchasing decisions, and increased emphasis by retailers on inventory management and productivity, which could result in fewer stores carrying our products or reduced demand by retailers of our products. In addition, we and other suppliers may experience increased customer leverage over us and greater exposure to credit risk as a result of industry consolidation. Any of the foregoing results can impact, and have adversely impacted in the past, our net revenues, margins and ability to operate efficiently.\nWe may be unable to maintain or increase our sales through our primary distribution channels.\nIn the United States, chain retailers and department stores are the primary distribution channels for our Levi's\u00ae and Dockers\u00ae products. Outside the United States, department stores, specialty retailers, franchised or other brand-dedicated stores, and shop-in-shops have traditionally been our primary distribution channels. Levi\u2019s and Dockers products are also sold through our brand-dedicated company-operated retail stores and e-commerce sites, as well as the e-commerce sites operated by certain of our key wholesale customers and other third parties. We distribute our Signature by Levi Strauss & Co. and Denizen brand products primarily through mass channel retailers in the Americas.\nWe may be unable to maintain or increase sales of our products through these distribution channels for several reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe retailers in these channels maintain - and seek to grow - substantial private-label and exclusive offerings as they strive to differentiate the brands and products they offer from those of their competitors;\n\u2022\nthe retailers may change their apparel strategies in a way that shifts focus away from our typical consumer or that otherwise results in a reduction of sales of our products generally, such as a reduction of fixture spaces devoted to our products or a shift to other brands;\n\u2022\nother channels, including vertically integrated specialty stores and e-commerce sites, account for a substantial portion of jeanswear and casual wear sales. In some of our mature markets, these stores and sites have placed competitive pressure on our primary distribution channels, and many of these stores and sites are now looking to our developing markets to grow their business; and\n\u2022\nshrinking points of distribution, including fewer doors at our customer locations, or bankruptcy or financial difficulties of a customer.\nFurther success by retailer private-labels, vertically-integrated specialty stores and e-commerce sites may continue to adversely affect the sales of our products across all channels, as well as the profitability of our brand-dedicated stores. Additionally, our ability to secure or maintain retail floor space, product display prominence, market share and sales in these channels depends on our ability to offer differentiated products and to increase retailer profitability on our products, and such efforts could have an adverse impact on our margins.\nWe are a global company with significant revenues and earnings generated internationally, which exposes us to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, as well as political and economic risks.\nA significant portion of our revenues and earnings are generated internationally. In addition, a substantial amount of our products come from sources outside the country of distribution. As a result, we are both directly and indirectly (through our suppliers) subject to the risks of doing business outside the United States, including:\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations, which have impacted our results of operations significantly in recent years;\n\u2022\npolitical, economic and social instability;\n\u2022\nchanges in tariffs and taxes;\n\u2022\nregulatory restrictions on repatriating foreign funds back to the United States; and\n\u2022\nless protective foreign laws relating to intellectual property.\nThe functional currency for most of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect the results of our operations and the value of our foreign assets and liabilities, including debt, which in turn may adversely affect results of operations and cash flows and the comparability of period-to-period results of operations. For example, the June 2016 decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union (\"Brexit\"), has resulted in increased uncertainty in the economic and political environment in Europe and has caused increased fluctuations and unpredictability in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we and foreign competitors sell products in the same market. Foreign policies and actions regarding currency valuation could result in actions by the United States and other countries to offset the effects of such fluctuations. Given the unpredictability and volatility of foreign currency exchange rates, ongoing or unusual volatility may adversely impact our business and financial conditions.\nFurthermore, due to our global operations, we are subject to numerous domestic and foreign laws and regulations affecting our business, such as those related to labor, employment, worker health and safety, antitrust and competition, environmental protection, consumer protection, import/export, and anti-corruption, including but not limited to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\") and the U.K. Bribery Act. Although we have put into place policies and procedures aimed at ensuring legal and regulatory compliance, our employees, subcontractors and agents could take actions that violate these requirements. Violations of these regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nChanges to trade policy, as well as tariff and import/export regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. or international social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business, as well as any negative sentiment toward the United States as a result of such changes, could adversely affect our business. The Trump Administration has recently instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements, including NAFTA, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the United States, economic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries, and other government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries where we conduct our business. The Trump Administration has also negotiated a replacement trade deal for NAFTA with Mexico and Canada, known as the USMCA, which still needs to be ratified by the respective government of each of the three countries. It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes.\nAs a result of recent policy changes of the Trump Administration and recent U.S. government proposals, there may be greater restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade. New tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments have imposed or are considering imposing trade sanctions on certain U.S. goods. Like many other multinational corporations, we do a significant amount of business that could be impacted by changes to U.S. and international trade policies (including governmental action related to tariffs, international trade agreements or economic sanctions). Such changes have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof, our industry and the global demand for our products and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe enactment of tax reform legislation, including legislation implementing changes in taxation of international business activities, could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.\nLegislation or other changes in tax laws could increase our liability and adversely affect our after-tax profitability. For example, the Tax Act was enacted in the United States on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate, cash tax expenses and net deferred tax assets. The Tax Act reduces the U.S. corporate statutory tax rate, eliminates or limits the deduction of several expenses that were previously deductible, imposes a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on undistributed historic earnings of foreign subsidiaries, requires a minimum tax on earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries and permits a tax-free repatriation of foreign earnings through a dividends received deduction. We have completed our evaluation of the overall impact of the Tax Act on our effective tax rate and balance sheet through fiscal year-end, and reflected the amounts in our financial statements. The Tax Act may have significant impacts in future periods.\nIf we encounter problems with distribution, our ability to deliver our products to market could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on both company-owned and third-party distribution facilities to warehouse and ship products to our wholesale customers, retail stores and e-commerce consumers throughout the world. As part of the pursuit for improved organizational agility and marketplace responsiveness, we have consolidated the number of distribution facilities we rely upon and continue to look for opportunities for further consolidation in certain regions. Such consolidation may make our operations more vulnerable to interruptions in the event of work stoppages, labor disputes, earthquakes, floods, fires or other natural disasters affecting these distribution centers. In addition, distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the transportation of products to and from their distribution facilities. Moreover, our distribution system includes computer-controlled and automated equipment, which may be subject to a number of risks related to data and system security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. If we encounter problems with our distribution system, whether company-owned or third-party, our ability to meet customer and consumer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be adversely affected.\nOur efforts to expand our retail business may not be successful, which could impact our operating results.\nOne of our key strategic priorities is to become a world-class omni-channel retailer by expanding our consumer reach in brand-dedicated stores globally, including making selective investments in company-operated stores and e-commerce sites, franchisee and other brand-dedicated store models. In many locations, we face major, established retail competitors who may be able to better attract consumers and execute their retail strategies. In addition, a retail operating model involves substantial investments in equipment and property, information systems, inventory and personnel. Due to the high fixed-cost structure associated with these investments, a significant expansion in company-operated stores, a decline in sales or the closure of or poor performance of stores could result in significant costs and impacts to our margins. Our ability to grow our retail channel also depends on the availability and cost of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, demographics, and other factors. Failure to identify and secure adequate new locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of the fleet of stores, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to effectively execute our e-commerce business, our reputation and operating results may be harmed.\nWhile e-commerce still comprises a small portion of our net revenues, it has been our fastest growing business over the last several years. The success of our e-commerce business depends, in part, on third parties and factors over which we have limited control, including changing consumer preferences and buying trends relating to e-commerce usage, both domestically and abroad, and promotional or other advertising initiatives employed by our wholesale customers or other third parties on their e-commerce sites. Any failure on our part, or on the part of our third-party digital partners, to provide attractive, reliable, secure and user-friendly e-commerce platforms could negatively impact our consumers\u2019 shopping experience, resulting in reduced website traffic, diminished loyalty to our brands and lost sales. In addition, as we continue to expand and increase the global presence of our e-commerce business, sales from our retail stores and wholesale channels of distribution in areas where e-commerce sites are introduced may decline due to changes in consumer shopping habits and cannibalization.\nWe are also vulnerable to certain additional risks and uncertainties associated with our e-commerce sites, including:\n\u2022changes in required technology interfaces;\n\u2022website downtime and other technical failures;\n\u2022costs and technical issues from website software upgrades;\n\u2022data and system security;\n\u2022computer viruses; and\n\u2022changes in applicable federal and state regulations.\nIn addition, we must keep up to date with competitive technology trends, including the use of new or improved technology, creative user interfaces and other e-commerce marketing tools such as paid search and mobile applications, among others, which may increase our costs and which may not succeed in increasing sales or attracting consumers. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties might adversely affect the sales in our e-commerce business, as well as damage our reputation and brands.\nAdditionally, the success of our e-commerce business and the satisfaction of our consumers depend on their timely receipt of our products. The efficient flow of our products requires that our company-operated and third-party operated distribution facilities have adequate capacity to support the current level of e-commerce operations and any anticipated increased levels that may follow from the growth of our e-commerce business. If we encounter difficulties with our distribution facilities or in our relationships with the third parties who operate the facilities, or if any such facilities were to shut down for any reason, including as a result of fire, other natural disaster or labor disruption, we could face shortages of inventory, resulting in \"out of stock\" conditions in the e-commerce sites we operate and those operated by our wholesale customers or other third parties, and we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our consumers and experience dissatisfaction from our consumers. Any of these issues could have an adverse effect on our business and harm our reputation.\nUnexpected obstacles in new markets may limit our expansion opportunities and cause our business and growth to suffer.\nOur future growth depends in part on our continued expansion efforts in new markets where we may have limited familiarity and experience with regulatory environments and market practices. We may not be able to penetrate or successfully operate in any new market as a result of such unfamiliarity or other unexpected barriers to entry. In connection with our expansion efforts, we may encounter obstacles, including cultural and linguistic differences, differences in regulatory environments, labor practices and market practices, economic or governmental instability, difficulties in keeping abreast of market, business and technical developments and foreign consumers\u2019 tastes and preferences. Our failure to develop our business in new markets or disappointing growth outside of existing markets that we may experience could harm our business and results of operations.\nWe face risks arising from any future restructuring of our operations and uncertainty with respect to our ability to achieve any anticipated cost savings associated with such restructuring.\nWe continuously assess opportunities to streamline operations and fuel long-term profitable growth. Future charges related to such actions may harm our profitability in the periods incurred.\nImplementation of global productivity actions presents a number of significant risks, including:\n\u2022\nactual or perceived disruption of service or reduction in service levels to customers and consumers;\n\u2022\npotential adverse effects on our internal control environment and inability to preserve adequate internal controls relating to our general and administrative functions in connection with the decision to outsource certain business service activities;\n\u2022\nactual or perceived disruption to suppliers, distribution networks and other important operational relationships and the inability to resolve potential conflicts in a timely manner;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in obtaining timely delivery of products of acceptable quality from our contract manufacturers;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management attention from ongoing business activities and strategic objectives; and\n\u2022\nfailure to maintain employee morale and retain key employees.\nBecause of these and other factors, we cannot predict whether we will fully realize the purpose and anticipated operational benefits or cost savings of any global productivity actions and, if we do not, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. Furthermore, if we experience adverse changes to our business, additional restructuring or reorganization activities may be required in the future.\nAny major disruption or failure of our information technology systems, or our failure to successfully implement new technology effectively, could adversely affect our business and operations.\nWe rely on various information technology systems, owned by us and third parties, to manage our operations. Over the last several years, we have been and continue to implement modifications and upgrades to our systems, including making changes to legacy systems, replacing legacy systems with successor systems with new functionality and acquiring new systems with new functionality. For example, over the next several years, we plan to continue the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning system across our company. These activities subject us to inherent costs and risks associated with replacing and upgrading these systems, including impairment of our ability to fulfill customer orders, potential disruption of our internal control structure, substantial capital expenditures, additional administration and operating expenses, retention of sufficiently skilled personnel to implement and operate the new systems, demands on management time, and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new or upgraded systems or of integrating new or upgraded systems into our current systems. Our system implementations may not result in productivity improvements at a level that outweighs the costs of implementation, or at all. In addition, the difficulties with implementing new or upgraded technology systems may cause disruptions in our business operations and have an adverse effect on our business and operations, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated.\nAs we outsource functions, we become more dependent on the entities performing those functions. Disruptions or delays at our third-party service providers could adversely impact our operations.\nAs part of our long-term profitable growth strategy, we are continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more cost-effective manner. In some cases, this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers. For example, we currently outsource a significant portion of our information technology, finance, customer relations and customer service functions to Wipro Limited. While we believe we conduct appropriate diligence before entering into agreements with any outsourcing entity, the failure of one or more of such entities to meet our performance standards and expectations, including with respect to data security, providing services on a timely basis or providing services at the prices we expect, may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, we could face increased costs associated with finding replacement vendors or hiring new employees in order to return these services in-house. We may outsource other functions in the future, which would increase our reliance on third parties.\nWe face cybersecurity risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.\nWe utilize systems and websites that allow for the secure storage and transmission of proprietary or confidential information regarding our consumers, employees, and others, including credit card information and personal information. As evidenced by the numerous companies who have suffered serious data security breaches, we may be vulnerable to, and unable to anticipate or detect data security breaches and data loss, including rapidly evolving and increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity attacks. In addition, data security breaches can also occur as a result of a breach by us or our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. In addition to our own databases, we use third-party service providers to store, process and transmit confidential or sensitive information on our behalf. Although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a data security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems.\nA data security breach may expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, and could result in significant costs to us, which may include, among others, potential liabilities to payment card networks for reimbursement of credit card fraud and card reissuance costs, including fines and penalties, potential liabilities from governmental or third-party investigations, proceedings or litigation and diversion of management attention. We could also experience delays or interruptions in our ability to function in the normal course of business, including delays in the fulfillment or cancellation of customer orders or disruptions in the manufacture and shipment of products. In addition, actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Any compromise or breach of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.\nThe regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. In the United States, various laws and regulations apply to the collection, processing, disclosure and security of certain types of data, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Gramm Leach Bliley Act and state laws relating to privacy and data security, including the California Consumer Privacy Act. Several foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the European Union, also have laws and regulations dealing with the handling and processing of personal information obtained from their residents, which in certain cases are more restrictive than those in the United States. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of various types of data, including data that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, email addresses and, in some jurisdictions, internet protocol\naddresses. Such laws and regulations may be modified or subject to new or different interpretations, and new laws and regulations may be enacted in the future. Within the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018 and replaced the 1995 European Union Data Protection Directive and superseded applicable European Union member state legislation, imposes significant new requirements on how companies collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for noncompliance.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us to comply with laws, regulations, policies or regulatory guidance relating to privacy or data security may result in governmental investigations and enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity, and could cause our customers and consumers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nWe currently rely on contract manufacturing of our products. Our inability to secure production sources meeting our quality, cost, working conditions and other requirements, or failures by our contract manufacturers to perform, could harm our sales, service levels and reputation.\nWe source approximately 99% of our products from independent contract manufacturers who purchase fabric and make our products and may also provide us with design and development services. As a result, we must locate and secure production capacity. We depend on contract manufacturers to maintain adequate financial resources, including access to sufficient credit, secure a sufficient supply of raw materials, and maintain sufficient development and manufacturing capacity in an environment characterized by continuing cost pressure and demands for product innovation and speed-to-market. In addition, we currently do not have any material long-term contracts with any of our contract manufacturers. Under our current arrangements with our contract manufacturers, these manufacturers generally may unilaterally terminate their relationship with us at any time. Finally, while we have historically worked with numerous manufacturers, in recent years we have begun consolidating the number of contract manufacturers from which we source our products. In addition, some of our contract manufacturers have merged. Reliance on a fewer number of contract manufacturers involves risk, and any difficulties or failures to perform by our contract manufacturers could cause delays in product shipments or otherwise negatively affect our results of operations.\nA contract manufacturer's failure to ship products to us in a timely manner or to meet our quality standards, or interference with our ability to receive shipments due to factors such as port or transportation conditions, could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers. Failing to make timely deliveries may cause our customers to cancel orders, refuse to accept deliveries, impose non-compliance charges, demand reduced prices, or reduce future orders, any of which could harm our sales and margins. If we need to replace any contract manufacturer, we may be unable to locate additional contract manufacturers on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or we may be unable to locate additional contract manufacturers with sufficient capacity to meet our requirements or to fill our orders in a timely manner.\nWe require contract manufacturers to meet our standards in terms of working conditions, environmental protection, raw materials, facility safety, security and other matters before we are willing to place business with them. As such, we may not be able to obtain the lowest-cost production. We may also encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our contract manufacturers in our methods, products and quality control standards. In addition, the labor and business practices of apparel manufacturers have received increased attention from the media, non-governmental organizations, consumers and governmental agencies in recent years. Any failure by our contract manufacturers to adhere to labor or other laws, appropriate labor or business practices, safety, structural or environmental standards, and the potential litigation, negative publicity and political pressure relating to any of these events, could harm our business and reputation.\nOur suppliers may be impacted by economic conditions and cycles and changing laws and regulatory requirements which could impact their ability to do business with us or cause us to terminate our relationship with them and require us to find replacements, which we may have difficulty doing.\nOur suppliers are subject to the fluctuations in general economic cycles, and global economic conditions may impact their ability to operate their businesses. They may also be impacted by the increasing costs of raw materials, labor and distribution, resulting in demands for less attractive contract terms or an inability for them to meet our requirements or conduct their own businesses. The performance and financial condition of a supplier may cause us to alter our business terms or to cease doing business with a particular supplier, or change our sourcing practices generally, which could in turn adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, regulatory developments such as reporting requirements on the use of \"conflict\" minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries could affect the sourcing and availability of raw materials used by our suppliers in the manufacturing of certain of our products. We have been and may continue to be subject to costs associated with regulations, including for the diligence pertaining to the presence of any conflict minerals used in our products and the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. The impact of such regulations may result in a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict free metals, and we cannot be assured that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, because our supply chain is complex,\nwe may face reputational challenges with our consumers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in the products we sell.\nIf one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us, we may incur significant losses.\nAs part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, which may include forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps, with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions. This risk may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty\u2019s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe loss of members of our executive management and other key employees or the failure to attract and retain key personnel could harm our business.\nOur future success depends, in part, on the continued service of our executive management team and other key employees, and the loss of the services of any key individual could harm our business. Our future success also depends, in part, on our ability to recruit, retain and motivate our employees sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives. Competition for experienced and well-qualified employees in our industry is particularly intense in many of the places where we do business, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. Moreover, shifts in U.S. immigration policy could negatively impact our ability to attract, hire and retain highly skilled employees who are from outside the United States.\nMost of the employees in our production and distribution facilities are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and any material job actions could negatively affect our results of operations.\nIn North America, most of our distribution employees are covered by various collective bargaining agreements. Outside North America, most of our production and distribution employees are covered by either industry-sponsored and/or government-sponsored collective bargaining mechanisms. Any work stoppages or other job actions by these employees could harm our business and reputation.\nOur licensees and franchisees may not comply with our product quality, manufacturing standards, marketing and other requirements, which could negatively affect our reputation and business.\nWe license our trademarks to third parties for manufacturing, marketing and distribution of various products. While we enter into comprehensive agreements with our licensees covering product design, product quality, sourcing, manufacturing, marketing and other requirements, our licensees may not comply fully with those agreements. Non-compliance could include marketing products under our brand names that do not meet our quality and other requirements or engaging in manufacturing practices that do not meet our supplier code of conduct. These activities could harm our brand equity, our reputation and our business.\nIn addition, we enter into franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate stores and, in limited circumstances, websites, in many countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores and websites that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. While the agreements we have entered into and plan to enter into in the future provide us with certain termination rights, the value of our brands could be impaired to the extent that these third parties do not operate their stores in a manner consistent with our requirements regarding our brand identities and customer experience standards. Failure to protect the value of our brands, or any other harmful acts or omissions by a franchisee, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.\nOur success depends on the continued protection of our trademarks and other proprietary intellectual property rights.\nOur trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and competitive position, and the loss of or inability to enforce trademark and other proprietary intellectual property rights could harm our business. We devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademark and other proprietary intellectual property rights on a global basis. In addition to our trademarks and other intellectual property rights, as we develop technologies, such as Project F.L.X., that we believe are innovative, we intend to continually assess the patentability of new intellectual property. However, the patents that we own and those that may be issued in the future may not adequately protect our intellectual property, survive legal challenges or provide us with competitive advantages, and our patent applications may not be granted. Our efforts to establish and protect our proprietary intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products. Unauthorized copying of our products or unauthorized use of our trademarks, patented technologies or other proprietary rights may not only erode sales of our products but may also cause significant reputational harm to our brand names and our ability to effectively represent ourselves to our consumers, contractors, suppliers and/or licensees. Moreover, others may seek to assert rights in, or ownership of, our trademarks and other intellectual property, including through civil and/or criminal prosecution. We may not be able to successfully resolve those claims, which may result in financial liability and criminal penalties. In addition, the laws and enforcement mechanisms of some foreign countries may not allow us to protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as we are able to in the United States and other countries.\nWe have substantial liabilities and cash requirements associated with our postretirement benefits, pension and deferred compensation plans.\nOur postretirement benefits, pension and deferred compensation plans result in substantial liabilities on our balance sheet. These plans and activities have and will generate substantial cash requirements for us, and these requirements may increase beyond our expectations in future years based on changing market conditions. The difference between plan obligations and assets, or the funded status of the plans, is a significant factor in determining the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans and the ongoing funding requirements of those plans. Many variables, such as changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, investment returns and/or the market value of plan assets, can affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans. Plan liabilities may impair our liquidity, have an unfavorable impact on our ability to obtain financing and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our competitors who do not have such liabilities and cash requirements.\nNatural disasters, public health crises, political crises, and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control may damage our facilities or the facilities of third parties on which we depend, and could impact consumer spending.\nOur global headquarters and the headquarters of our Americas region are both located in California near major geologic faults that have experienced earthquakes in the past. An earthquake or other natural disaster or power shortages or outages could disrupt operations or impair critical systems. Any of these disruptions or other events outside of our control could affect our business negatively, harming our operating results. In addition, if any of our facilities, including our manufacturing, finishing or distribution facilities, our company-operated or franchised stores or the facilities of our suppliers, third-party service providers, or customers, is affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, power shortages or outages, floods or monsoons, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, political crises, such as terrorism, war, political instability or other conflict, or other events outside of our control, our business and operating results could suffer. Moreover, these types of events could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions or depending upon the severity, globally, which could adversely impact our operating results. Similar disasters occurring at our vendors\u2019 manufacturing facilities could impact our reputation and our consumers\u2019 perception of our brands.\nFailure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws in various jurisdictions around the world. The FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar applicable laws generally prohibit companies, as well as their officers, directors, employees and third-party intermediaries, business partners and agents, from making improper payments or providing other improper things of value to government officials or other persons. We and our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state owned or affiliated entities and other third parties where we may be held liable for corrupt or other illegal activities, even if we do not explicitly authorize them. While we have policies and procedures and internal controls to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that all of our employees and third-party intermediaries, business partners and agents will not take actions in violation of such policies and laws, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. To the extent that we learn that any of our employees or third-party intermediaries, business partners or agents do not adhere to our policies, procedures or internal controls, we are committed to taking appropriate remedial action. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our directors, officers, employees or third-party intermediaries, agents or business partners have or may have violated such laws, we may be required to investigate\nor to have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances. Detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations can be extensive and require a significant diversion of time, resources and attention from senior management. Any violation of the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, and criminal or civil sanctions, penalties and fines, any of which may could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur current and future products may experience quality problems from time to time that could result in negative publicity, litigation, product recalls and warranty claims, which could result in decreased revenues and harm to our brands.\nThere can be no assurance we will be able to detect, prevent or fix all defects that may affect our products. Inconsistency of legislation and regulations may also affect the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations. Such problems could hurt the image of our brands, which is critical to maintaining and expanding our business. Any negative publicity or lawsuits filed against us related to the perceived quality of our products could harm our brand and decrease demand for our products.\nClimate change and related regulatory responses may adversely impact our business.\nThere is increasing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Changes in weather patterns and an increased frequency, intensity and duration of extreme weather conditions could, among other things, adversely impact the cultivation of cotton, which is a key resource in the production of our products, disrupt the operation of our supply chain and the productivity of our contract manufacturers, increase our product costs and impact the types of apparel products that consumers purchase. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nIn many of the countries in which we operate, governmental bodies are increasingly enacting legislation and regulations in response to the potential impacts of climate change. These laws and regulations, which may be mandatory, have the potential to impact our operations directly or indirectly as a result of required compliance by us, our suppliers and our contract manufacturers. In addition, we may choose to take voluntary steps to mitigate our impact on climate change. As a result, we may experience increases in energy, production, transportation and raw material costs, capital expenditures or insurance premiums and deductibles. Inconsistency of legislation and regulations among jurisdictions may also affect the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations. Any assessment of the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulations or industry standards, as well as any international treaties and accords, is uncertain given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in the countries in which we operate.\nFuture acquisitions of and investments in new businesses could impact our business and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we may acquire or invest in businesses or partnerships that we believe could complement our business or offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of such acquisitions or investments may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses, regardless of whether the acquisition or investment is ultimately completed. In addition, acquisitions and investments may not perform as expected or cause us to assume unrecognized or underestimated liabilities. Further, if we are able to successfully identify and acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired personnel or operations, or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition, any of which could harm our business and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to our Industry\nOur revenues are influenced by economic conditions that impact consumer spending.\nApparel is a cyclical industry that is dependent upon the overall level of consumer spending. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our products, generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty. Our wholesale customers anticipate and respond to adverse changes in economic conditions and uncertainty by closing doors, reducing inventories, canceling orders or increasing promotional activity. Our brand-dedicated stores are also affected by these conditions which may lead to a decline in consumer traffic and spending in these stores. As a result, factors that diminish consumer spending and confidence in any of the markets in which we compete, particularly deterioration in general economic conditions, the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on tourism and tourist spending, volatility in investment returns, fear of unemployment, increases in energy costs or interest rates, housing market downturns, fear about and impact of pandemic illness, and other factors such as acts of war, natural disasters or terrorist or political events that impact consumer confidence, could reduce our sales and adversely affect our business and financial condition through their impact on our wholesale customers as well as their direct impact on us. These outcomes and behaviors have in the past, and may continue to in the future, adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIntense competition in the global apparel industry could lead to reduced sales and prices.\nWe face a variety of competitive challenges in the global apparel industry from a variety of jeanswear, athleisure and casual apparel companies, and competition has increased over the years due to factors such as;\n\u2022\nthe international expansion and increased presence of vertically integrated specialty stores;\n\u2022\nexpansion into e-commerce by existing and new competitors;\n\u2022\nthe proliferation of private labels and exclusive brands offered by department stores, chain stores and mass channel retailers;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of lines of jeans, athleisure and casual apparel by well-known and successful athletic wear companies; and\n\u2022\nthe transition of apparel companies who traditionally relied on wholesale distribution channels into their own retail distribution network.\nIn addition, some of these competitors have greater financial, supply, distribution and marketing resources and may be able to adapt to changes in consumer preferences or retail requirements more quickly or devote greater resources to the building and sustaining of their brand equity and the marketing and sale of their products both in stores and online. In addition, some of these competitors may be able to achieve lower product costs or adopt more aggressive pricing and discounting policies. As a result, we may not be able to compete as effectively with them and may not be able to maintain or grow the demand for our products. Failure to compete effectively due to these factors could reduce our sales and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe success of our business depends upon our ability to forecast consumer demand and market conditions and offer on-trend and new and updated products at attractive price points.\nThe global apparel industry is characterized by ever-changing fashion trends and consumer preferences and by the rapid replication of new products by competitors. The apparel industry is also impacted by changing consumer preferences regarding spending categories generally, including shifts away from consumer spending and towards \"experiential\" spending. As a result, our success depends in large part on our ability to develop, market and deliver innovative and stylish products at a pace, intensity, and price competitive with other brands in the markets in which we sell our products. In addition, we must create products at a range of price points that appeal to the consumers of both our wholesale customers and our dedicated retail stores and e-commerce sites situated in each of our diverse geographic regions. Our development and production cycles take place prior to full visibility into all of these factors for the coming seasons. Failure on our part to forecast consumer demand and market conditions and to regularly and rapidly develop innovative and stylish products and update core products could limit sales growth, adversely affect retail and consumer acceptance of our products, and negatively impact the consumer traffic in our dedicated retail stores. In addition, if we fail to accurately forecast consumer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels, which may result in inventory write-downs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices. This could have an adverse effect on the image and reputation of our brands and could adversely affect our gross margins. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products, we may experience inventory shortages, which could delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer and consumer relationships and diminish brand loyalty. Moreover, our newer products may not produce as high a gross margin as our traditional products and thus may have an adverse effect on our overall margins and profitability.\nThe global apparel industry is subject to intense pricing pressure.\nThe apparel industry is characterized by low barriers to entry for both suppliers and marketers, global sourcing through suppliers located throughout the world, trade liberalization, continuing movement of product sourcing to lower cost countries, regular promotional activity, and the ongoing emergence of new competitors with widely varying strategies and resources. These factors have contributed, and may continue to contribute in the future, to intense pricing pressure and uncertainty throughout the supply chain. Pricing pressure has been exacerbated by the variability of raw materials in recent years. This pressure could have adverse effects on our business and financial condition, including:\n\u2022\nreduced gross margins across our product lines and distribution channels;\n\u2022\nincreased retailer demands for allowances, incentives and other forms of economic support; and\n\u2022\nincreased pressure on us to reduce our production costs and operating expenses.\nIncreases in the price of raw materials or wage rates could increase our cost of goods and negatively impact our financial results.\nThe principal fabrics used in our products include cotton, blends, synthetics and wools. The prices we pay our suppliers for our products are dependent in part on the market price for raw materials used to produce them, primarily cotton. The price and availability of cotton may fluctuate substantially, depending on a variety of factors, including demand, acreage devoted to cotton crops and crop yields, weather, supply conditions, transportation costs, energy prices, work stoppages, government regulation and policy, economic climates, market speculation and other unpredictable factors. Any and all of these factors may be exacerbated by global climate change. Cotton prices suffered from unprecedented variability and uncertainty in prior years and may fluctuate significantly again in the future. In addition, prices of purchased finished products also depend on wage rates in the regions where our contract manufacturers are located, as well as freight costs from those regions. In addition, fluctuations in wage rates required by legal or industry standards could increase our costs. Increases in raw material costs or wage rates, unless sufficiently offset by our pricing actions, may cause a decrease in our profitability and negatively impact our sales volume. These factors may also have an adverse impact on our cash and working capital needs as well as those of our suppliers.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing overseas, as well as risks associated with potential tariffs or a global trade war.\nWe import both raw materials and finished garments into all of our operating regions. Our ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputes and work stoppages, political unrest, severe weather, or security requirements in the United States and other countries. These issues could delay importation of products or require us to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to our customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transportation costs, which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition, specifically our gross margin and overall profitability.\nSubstantially all of our import operations are subject to complex custom laws, regulations and tax requirements as well as trade regulations, such as tariffs and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements or bilateral actions. In addition, the countries in which our products are manufactured or imported may from time to time impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs or other restrictions on our imports or adversely modify existing restrictions. Adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions, or the failure by us or our suppliers to comply with customs regulations or similar laws, could harm our business. In this regard, the results of the November 2016 election in the United States and the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to future tax and trade regulations. Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, such as the recently passed Tax Cuts and Job Act (the \"Tax Act\") in the United States, a withdrawal of the United States from, or a significant renegotiation or replacement of the North America Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\"), the disallowance of tax deductions on imported merchandise, or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nRecently, the Trump Administration announced tariffs on certain steel and aluminum products imported into the United States, which has resulted in reciprocal tariffs from the European Union on goods, including denim products, imported from the United States. Because we manufacture most of our products outside the United States, these reciprocal tariffs are not expected to have a material impact on our business. The Trump Administration has also imposed $34 billion in tariffs on goods imported from China in connection with China\u2019s intellectual property practices and has announced a potential additional $200 billion in tariffs on goods imported from China. The Trump Administration has also negotiated a replacement trade deal for NAFTA with Mexico and Canada (the \"USMCA\"), which still needs to be ratified by the respective government of each of the three countries. Approximately 15% to 20% of the products that we sell in the United States are manufactured in China and Mexico. If the Trump Administration follows through on its proposed China tariffs or replaces NAFTA with USMCA, or if additional tariffs or trade restrictions are implemented by the United States or other countries in connection with a global trade war, the cost of our products manufactured in China, Mexico or other countries and imported into the United States or other countries could increase, which in turn could adversely affect the demand for these products and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Debt\nWe have debt and interest payment requirements at a level that may restrict our future operations.\nAs of November 25, 2018, we had $1.1 billion of debt, all of which was unsecured, and we had $805.2 million of additional borrowing capacity under our credit facility. Our debt requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our debt, which reduces funds available for other business purposes and results in us having lower net income than we would otherwise have had. This dedicated use of cash could impact our ability to successfully compete by, for example:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing required to fund working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes.\nA substantial portion of our debt is Euro-denominated senior notes. In addition, borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at variable rates. As a result, increases in market interest rates and changes in foreign exchange rates could require a greater portion of our cash flow to be used to pay interest, which could further hinder our operations. Increases in market interest rates may also affect the trading price of our debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate. Our ability to satisfy our obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe Tax Act places limitations on businesses abilities to deduct interest expenses. If our adjusted taxable income were to decrease, we may not be able to fully deduct our interest expenses.\nRestrictions in our notes, indentures and credit facility may limit our activities, including dividend payments, share repurchases and acquisitions.\nOur credit facility and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes contain restrictions, including covenants limiting our ability to incur additional debt, grant liens, make acquisitions and other investments, prepay specified debt, consolidate, merge or acquire other businesses or engage in other fundamental changes, sell assets, pay dividends and other distributions, repurchase stock, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into capital leases or certain leases not in the ordinary course of business, enter into certain derivatives, grant negative pledges on our assets, make loans or other investments, guarantee third-party obligations, engage in sale leasebacks and make changes in our corporate structure. These restrictions, in combination with our leveraged condition, may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy, grow our business or compete with companies not similarly restricted.\nIf our foreign subsidiaries are unable to distribute cash to us when needed, we may be unable to satisfy our obligations under our debt securities, which could force us to sell assets or use cash that we were planning to use elsewhere in our business.\nWe conduct our international operations through foreign subsidiaries and we only receive the cash that remains after our foreign subsidiaries satisfy their obligations. We may depend upon funds from our foreign subsidiaries for a portion of the funds necessary to meet our debt service obligations. Any agreements our foreign subsidiaries enter into with other parties, as well as applicable laws and regulations limiting the right and ability of non-U.S. subsidiaries and affiliates to pay dividends and remit cash to affiliated companies, may restrict the ability of our foreign subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us. If those subsidiaries are unable to pass on the amount of cash that we need, we may be unable to make payments on our debt obligations, which could force us to sell assets or use cash that we were planning on using elsewhere in our business, which could hinder our operations.\nOur business is affected by seasonality, which could result in fluctuations in our operating results.\nWe experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in our third and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in our first and second fiscal quarters. In addition, our customers and consumers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice. As a result, we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales. Accordingly, our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period. This seasonality, along with other factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, changes in consumer preferences, weather conditions, including the effects of climate change, the availability of import quotas, transportation disruptions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate.\nWe are subject to periodic claims and litigation that could result in unexpected expenses and could ultimately be resolved against us.\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in litigation and other proceedings, including matters related to commercial disputes, product liability, intellectual property, trade, customs laws and regulations, employment, regulatory compliance and other claims related to our business. Any such proceeding or audit could result in significant settlement amounts, damages, fines or other penalties, divert financial and management resources and result in significant legal fees. An unfavorable outcome of any particular proceeding could exceed the limits of our insurance policies, or our insurance carriers may decline to fund such final settlements or judgments, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any such proceeding could negatively impact our brand equity and our reputation.\nChanges in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity, increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options.\nOur long-term debt is currently rated BB+ by Standard & Poor\u2019s and Ba1 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service. If our credit ratings are lowered, borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term credit facilities may increase and our financing options, including our access to the unsecured credit market, could be limited. In addition, macroeconomic conditions such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt.", "PERMNO": 18424, "SIC": 2300, "TIC": "LEVI"}
