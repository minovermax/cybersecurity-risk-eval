RISK FACTORS.\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this report, before making an investment decision. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. You should read the section entitled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d above for a discussion of what types of statements are forward-looking statements, as well as the significance of such statements in the context of this report.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe could lose control of Hainan Shiner, our primary operating subsidiary, if we are unable to repay our loan or if we are unable to obtain a waiver for unsanctioned use of proceeds as a result of our temporary lending operations.\nOn April 17, 2014, Hainan Shiner, our primary operating subsidiary, drew down entirely on a RMB120 million (approximately $19.5 million) credit facility collateralized by the common stock of Hainan Shiner, our buildings and our land use rights. The facility bears interest at 7.35% per annum and is due and payable on April 17, 2017. Under the terms of the credit facility agreement, the proceeds of the funds borrowed under the credit facility are to be used solely for the construction of an office building and research facility at the Hainan Xiandai Packaging Industrial Park, and for the purchase of research and development equipment. However, on April 30, 2014, we loaned the entire proceeds of the credit facility to unrelated third parties as set forth below. Such parties have not provided us with significant collateral on such loans, other than a written guarantee from each of the borrowers and an unrelated fourth party. The use of the proceeds from the credit facility to provide such loans constitutes a breach under the credit facility agreement. Unless and until we obtain a waiver from the lender for such use of proceeds, the lender has the right to declare a breach of the trust agreement and enforce its right to ownership of the stock, buildings and land use rights of Hainan Shiner, our primary operating subsidiary. Furthermore, if any of the borrowers are unable to fulfill their obligations under our loans to them and their guarantees fail, we will be obligated to repay the credit facility in its entirety. If we are unable to repay this debt in full by the due date we could lose control of Hainan Shiner, our buildings and our land use rights. For more information regarding such third party loans see Note 3 to our financial statements.\nWe cannot be certain that our product innovations and marketing successes will continue.\nWe believe our past performance has been based on, and our future success will depend upon, in part, our ability to continue to improve our existing products through product innovation and to develop, market and produce new products. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in the introduction, marketing and production of new products or product innovations, or that we will develop and introduce in a timely manner innovations to our existing products which satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance. Although we have developed products that have met customers\u2019 requirements in the past, there is no assurance that any of our R&D efforts will necessarily lead to any new or enhanced products or generate sufficient market share to justify commercialization. We must continually improve our current products and develop and introduce new or enhanced products that address the requirements of our customers and are competitive in terms of functionality, performance, quality and price in order to maintain and increase our market share. If our new products are unable to gain market acceptance, we would be forced to write-off the related inventory and would not be able to generate future revenue from our investment in R&D. In such event, we would be unable to increase our market share and achieve and sustain profitability. Our failure to develop new products and introduce them successfully and in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n- 17 -\nOur advanced technology may not satisfy the changing needs of our customers.\nWith any advanced product authentication technology, including the technology of our current and proposed products, there are risks that the technology may not successfully address all of our customers\u2019 needs. While we have already established successful relationships with Chinese customers with regard to our products, our customers\u2019 ultimate needs may change or vary, thus introducing variables which may affect the ability of our proposed products to address all of our customers\u2019 ultimate technology needs in an economically feasible manner.\nOur growth strategy and future success depends upon commercial acceptance of products incorporating technologies we have developed and are continuing to develop. Technological trends have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our business. Our results of operations and ability to remain competitive are largely based upon our ability to accurately anticipate customer and market requirements. Our success in developing, introducing and selling new and enhanced products depends upon a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022 accurate technology and product selection;\n\u2022 timely and efficient completion of product design and treatment;\n\u2022 timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing processes;\n\u2022 product performance; and\n\u2022 product support and effective sales and marketing.\nWe may not be able to accurately forecast or respond to commercial and technological trends in the industries in which we operate.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the advanced film product industry.\nThe advanced film product authentication industry is a relatively new industry and market, especially in China and other parts of Asia, and continues to evolve in terms of customer/market needs, applications, and technology. We believe we have hired or engaged personnel and outside consultants who have experience and are recognized within the industry to be experts. With respect to technology, while we continue to seek out and develop \u201cnext generation\u201d technology through acquisition, strategic partnerships, and our own R&D, there is no guarantee that we will be able to keep pace with technological developments and market demands in this evolving industry and market. Technological changes, process improvements, or operating improvements that could adversely affect us include:\n\u2022 development of new technologies by our competitors or counterfeiters;\n\u2022 changes in product requirements of our customers; and\n\u2022 improvements in the alternatives to our technologies.\nWe may not have sufficient funds to devote to R&D, or our R&D efforts may not be successful in developing products in the time, or with the characteristics, necessary to meet customer needs. If we do not adapt to such changes or improvements, our competitive position, operations and prospects would be materially affected.\nIntense competition in the advanced and packaging markets may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe operate in highly competitive and rapidly evolving fields, and new developments are expected to continue at a rapid pace. We believe there are few barriers to entry into many of our markets. As a result, we may experience competition resulting from new manufacturers of various types of film in our product lines. Competitors may succeed in developing alternative technologies and products that are more effective, easier to use or less expensive than those which have been or are being developed by us or that would render our technology and products obsolete and non-competitive. Any of these actions by our competitors could adversely affect our sales.\nIn addition, we face competition from a substantial number of companies, which sell similar and substitute packaging products. Although we believe we have developed strategic relationships in China to best penetrate China\u2019s market, we face competition from other providers, some of which have greater financial and human resources, have had a longer operating history, and have greater name recognition than we do. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources, production and marketing capabilities, and may have extensive production facilities, well-developed sales and marketing staffs and substantial financial resources. Competitive products are also available from a number of local manufacturers. This results in competition that is highly price sensitive. We also compete on the basis of quality, service, timely delivery and differentiation of product properties.\n- 18 -\nAn increase in competition could result in material selling price reductions or loss of our market share. This could materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nWe are a major purchaser of many commodities that we use for raw materials in the manufacturing process of our products, and price changes for the commodities we depend on may adversely affect our profitability.\nWith the rapid growth of China\u2019s economy, the demand for certain raw materials is great while the supply may be more limited. This may affect our ability to secure the necessary raw materials we need in a cost-effective manner, including chemicals and other items needed for production of our products at the volume of purchase orders that we anticipate receiving.\nFor example, the PET resin used in our coated film products is currently used as a raw material in China\u2019s textile industry, and the market prices of PET resin may fluctuate due to changes in supply and demand conditions in that industry. Any sudden shortage of supply of, or significant increase in demand for, PET resin and additives may result in higher market prices and thereby increase our cost of sales. The prices of PET resin and additives are, to a certain extent, affected by the price movement of crude oil.\nIf there is a significant increase in the cost of our raw materials and we are unable to pass on such increase to our customers on a timely basis or at all, our profit margins and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nPetroleum prices impact our operating results.\nPetroleum is the prime ingredient in many plastics that we use to make many of our products. We estimate that an increase in the price of crude oil of $10.00 per barrel could cause our gross margin to decline by up to 6% on the sale of these products. There has been some increase in the cost of our raw materials as a result of an increase in crude oil prices throughout the year. Current political unrest in the Middle East has resulted in an increase in the price of crude oil and may result in further increases in the price of crude oil.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our technology and other proprietary rights.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and protect our products, methods, processes and other technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties both domestically in China and abroad. We rely on patents, trademarks and licenses to protect our intellectual property. We also have patent applications pending in China, and have worked and continue to work closely with China\u2019s patent officials to preserve our intellectual property rights. If we are unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights with respect to our products, methods, processes and other technologies, our prospects for revenue growth could be significantly diminished. Additionally, if our products, methods, processes and other technologies infringe on the intellectual property rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs.\nOur ability to compete in our markets and to achieve future revenue growth will depend, in significant part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. The legal regime in China for the protection of intellectual property rights is still at its early stage of development. Intellectual property protection became a national effort in China in 1979 when China adopted its first statute on the protection of trademarks. Since then, China has adopted its Patent Law, Trademark Law and Copyright Law and promulgated related regulations such as Regulation on Computer Software Protection, Regulation on the Protection of Layout Designs of Integrated Circuits and Regulation on Internet Domain Names. China has also acceded to various international treaties and conventions in this area, such as the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, Patent Cooperation Treaty, Madrid Agreement and its Protocol Concerning the International Registration of Marks. In addition, when China became a party to the World Trade Organization in 2001, China amended many of its laws and regulations to comply with the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. Despite many laws and regulations promulgated and other efforts made by China over the years to tighten up its regulation and protection of intellectual property rights, private parties may not enjoy intellectual property rights in China to the same extent as they would in many Western countries, including the US, and enforcement of such laws and regulations in China have not achieved the levels reached in those countries. Both the administrative agencies and the court system in China are not well-equipped to deal with violations or handle the nuances and complexities between compliant technological innovation and non-compliant infringement.\nThere is no assurance that the measures that we have put into place to protect our intellectual property rights will be sufficient. As the number of patents, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights in our industry increases, and as the coverage of these rights and the functionality of the products in the market further overlap, we believe business entities in our industry may face more frequent infringement claims. Litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights could result in substantial costs and may not be successful. If we are not able to successfully defend our intellectual property rights, we might lose rights to technology that we need to conduct and develop our business. This may seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition, and enable our competitors to use our intellectual property to compete against us.\n- 19 -\nEntry of new BOPP and advanced film producers in China may increase the supply of, and decrease the prices of, BOPP and advanced film in the industry, and hence lead to a decline in our profit margins.\nWe believe we are currently one of the few producers of BOPP and advanced film in China with R&D capabilities. Our past financial performance is attributable to our market position in the industry. Over time, there may be new entrants into our industry, whether as a result of increased access to the production technology of BOPP and advanced film or otherwise. Accordingly, we may experience increased competition, and the entry of new BOPP and advanced film producers will also lead to an increase in the industry supply of BOPP and advanced film resulting in more competitive pricing. We may have to price our products in response to competitive market conditions and this may lead to a decline in our profit margins. In the event that we are unable to successfully compete or retain effective control over the pricing of our products, our profit margins will decrease and our revenues and net income may also decrease.\nIn addition, China has gradually lifted its import restrictions, lowered import tariffs and relaxed foreign investment restrictions after its entry into the World Trade Organization in December 2001. This may lead to increased competition from foreign companies in our industry, some of which are significantly larger and financially stronger than us. If we fail to compete effectively with these companies in the future, our current business and future growth potential could be adversely affected.\nWith respect to our BOPP tobacco film and other flexible packaging materials, we have a large amount of sales concentrated in a small number of customers.\nAny decrease in the demand for our flexible packaging materials, particularly our BOPP tobacco film, will significantly affect our financial performance. Although demand for our BOPP tobacco film has gradually been increasing, any significant fall in the consumption of tobacco, in particular, whether as a result of health concerns or otherwise, could result in a decline in the sales of our products and adversely impact our financial condition, business and operation.\nA disruption in the supply of utilities, fire or other calamity at our manufacturing plants would disrupt production of our products and adversely affect our sales.\nOur films are manufactured solely at our production facilities located in Haikou City and Zhuhai City in China. While we have not experienced any calamities in the past which disrupted production, any disruption in the supply of utilities, in particular, electricity or power supply or any outbreak of fire, flood or other calamity resulting in significant damage at our facilities, would severely affect our production capabilities. As a result, we could incur substantial liabilities that could reduce or eliminate the funds available for product development, or result in a loss of equipment and properties. While we maintain insurance policies covering losses with respect to damage to our properties, machinery and inventories of raw materials and products, we cannot assure you that our insurance would be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses.\nWe have limited experience in operating outside mainland China, and failure to achieve our international marketing and sales strategy may have an adverse effect on our business growth in the future.\nOur future growth depends, to a considerable extent, on our ability to develop both the domestic and overseas markets. We are currently exploring new business opportunities outside mainland China for our products. We have a limited number of customers outside China, mainly in the US and Europe. However, we have limited experience in operating outside mainland China, including dealing with foreign regulatory environments and market practices, and cannot guarantee that we will be able to penetrate any international market. In connection with our initial efforts to expand overseas, we have encountered many obstacles, including cultural and linguistic differences, difficulties in keeping abreast of market, business and technical developments in foreign jurisdictions, and political and social disturbances. Failure in the development of international markets may have an adverse effect on our business growth in the future.\nCompliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related corporate governance and public disclosure requirements have resulted in significant additional expense.\nChanging laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the associated SEC regulations have resulted in significant additional expense as well as a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, we might be subject to lawsuits or sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC, and our reputation may be harmed.\n- 20 -\nWe are subject to many environmental and safety regulations that may result in unanticipated costs or liabilities, that could reduce our profitability.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to pollution, protection of the environment and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials. Actual or alleged violations of environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as, under some environmental laws, the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability. Moreover, changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require us to modify our facilities or operations. Accordingly, environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities that could reduce our profitability.\nIn addition, we could incur significant expenditures in order to comply with existing or future environmental or safety laws. Capital expenditures and costs relating to environmental or safety matters will be subject to evolving regulatory requirements and will depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose requirements on our operations. Capital expenditures and costs beyond those currently anticipated may therefore be required under existing or future environmental or safety laws.\nFurthermore, we may be liable for the costs of investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination on or from our properties or at off-site locations where we disposed of or arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials or from disposal activities that pre-dated our purchase of our businesses. We may therefore incur additional costs and expenditures beyond those currently anticipated to address all such known and unknown situations under existing and future environmental laws. In 2013, we incurred expenses of approximately $15,000 to comply with environmental and safety laws.\nFailure to adequately comply with hygiene and food safety standards set by the PRC may disrupt our operations.\nIn accordance with the laws and regulations of the PRC, we are required to comply with applicable hygiene and food safety standards, including the standards set forth in the Food Safety Law, and any rules and regulations promulgated by the central Chinese government or local provincial governments thereunder. Failure to comply with these laws, rules and regulations, could require us to temporarily or permanently suspend some or all of our production operations, which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nPRC food safety and hygiene laws may become more onerous, which may adversely affect our operations and financial performance and lead to an increase in our costs which we may be unable to pass on to our customers.\nAs a manufacturer of food-related products, we are subject to extensive governmental regulation. For example, we are subject to the Food Safety Law (\u201cFSL\u201d) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. We cannot assure stockholders that in the future the PRC food safety and hygiene laws will not become more onerous, providing for stricter and more comprehensive monitoring and regulation of food-related product manufacturers, which may lead to an increase in our costs of complying with such regulations resulting in a material adverse effect on its results of operations. In 2013, we incurred expenses of approximately $10,000 to comply with the FSL\nConcerns with the safety and quality of packaged food products could cause consumers to avoid such products and our customers to stop producing packaged food products.\nWe could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of packaged food products. Adverse publicity about these types of concerns, such as the publicity concerning the use of the substance melamine in milk and infant formula, may discourage consumers from buying packaged food products, which would reduce or eliminate the need for our food packaging, causing production disruptions. Any negative change in customer perceptions about the safety and quality of packaged food products could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIncreased consumption tax on cigarettes may materially impact our tobacco film sales\nOn May 1, 2009, the central Chinese government raised the consumption tax on cigarettes in an effort to curb smoking and increase state revenues. The consumption tax was raised by between 6% and 11% and is based on the sales price of the cigarettes - the higher the sales price the higher the percentage of consumption tax. This tax hike, together with a new 5% tax on cigarette wholesalers, which became effective on May 1, 2009, may negatively impact the cigarette manufacturing business in China and, depending on the severity of the impact thereon, may create a severe softening of our sales in the tobacco film market. Coupled with the decrease in our sales as a result of the economic crisis, the new tobacco-related taxes may have a material adverse effect on both our sales price and volume for the foreseeable future.\n- 21 -\nDeterioration of economic conditions could negatively impact our business.\nOur business may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, availability of capital markets, consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs (including fuel surcharges) and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Any such changes could adversely affect the demand for our products or the cost and availability of our needed raw materials, thereby negatively affecting our financial results.\nThe recent disruptions in credit and other financial markets and deterioration of global economic conditions, could, among other things:\n\u2022 make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or to finance debt in the future;\n\u2022 impair the financial condition of some of our customers or suppliers, thereby increasing bad debts or non-performance by suppliers; and\n\u2022 negatively impact demand for our products, which could result in a reduction of sales, operating income and cash flows.\nRISKS RELATED TO CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESS IN CHINA\nWe are subject to international economic and political risks over which we have little or no control and may be unable to alter our business practice in time to avoid the possibility of reduced revenues.\nA substantial portion of our business is conducted in China. Doing business outside the US, particularly in China, subjects us to various risks including changing economic and political conditions, major work stoppages, exchange controls, currency fluctuations, armed conflicts and unexpected changes in United States and foreign laws relating to tariffs, trade restrictions, transportation regulations, foreign investments and taxation. We have no control over most of these risks and may be unable to anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions. Therefore, we may be unable to alter our business practices in time to avoid the possibility of reduced revenues.\nChina\u2019s economic policies could affect our business.\nGenerally, all of our assets are located in China and a substantial amount of our revenue is derived from our operations in China. Accordingly, our results of operations and prospects are subject, to a significant extent, to the economic, political and legal developments in China.\nWhile China\u2019s economy has experienced significant growth in the past twenty years, such growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. China\u2019s government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures benefit the overall economy of China, but they may also have a negative effect on us. For example, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected by the government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations. The economy of China has been changing from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy. In recent years, China government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets, and the establishment of corporate governance in business enterprises; however, a substantial portion of productive assets in China are still owned by our government. In addition, China government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. It also exercises significant control over China\u2019s economic growth through the allocation of resources, the control of payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, the setting of monetary policy and the provision of preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.\nWe may have difficulty establishing adequate management, legal and financial controls in China.\nChina historically has not adopted a Western style of management and financial reporting concepts and practices, as well as in modern banking, computer and other control systems. We may have difficulty in hiring and retaining a sufficient number of qualified employees to work in China. As a result of these factors, we may experience difficulty in establishing management, legal and financial controls, collecting financial data and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet Western standards.\n- 22 -\nOur bank accounts are not insured or protected against loss.\nWe maintain our cash with various banks and trust companies located in China. Our cash accounts are not insured or otherwise protected. Should any bank or trust company holding our cash deposits become insolvent, or if we are otherwise unable to withdraw funds, we would lose the cash on deposit with that particular bank or trust company.\nAs we have limited business insurance coverage in China, any loss which we suffer may not be insured or may be insured to only a limited extent.\nThe insurance industry in China is still in an early state of development and insurance companies located in China offer limited business insurance products. In the event of damage or loss to our properties, our insurance may not provide as much coverage as if we were insured by insurance companies in the United States.\nTax laws and regulations in China are subject to substantial revision, some of which may adversely affect our profitability.\nChina\u2019s tax system is in a state of flux, and it is anticipated that China\u2019s tax regime will be altered in the coming years. Tax benefits that we presently enjoy may not be available in the wake of these changes, and we could incur tax obligations to our government that are significantly higher than anticipated. These increased tax obligations could negatively impact our financial condition and our revenues, gross margins, profitability and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result.\nCertain tax exemptions that we presently enjoy in China are scheduled to expire over the next several years.\nSince a substantial portion of our operations are located in a privileged economic zone, we are entitled to certain tax benefits. These tax benefits are presently scheduled to expire over the next several years. For example, Zhuhai presently has a 50% exemption from federal tax through December 31, 2013. As these exemptions expire, our income tax expenses will increase, reducing our net income below what it would be if we continued to enjoy these exemptions.\nWe may face judicial corruption in China.\nAnother obstacle to foreign investment in China is corruption. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain recourse in any legal disputes with suppliers, customers or other parties with whom we conduct business, if desired, through China\u2019s poorly developed and sometimes corrupt judicial systems.\nIf relations between the United States and China worsen, investors may be unwilling to hold or buy our stock and our stock price may decrease.\nAt various times during recent years, the United States and China have had significant disagreements over political and economic issues. Controversies may arise in the future between these two countries. Any political or trade controversies between the United States and China, whether or not directly related to our business, could reduce the price of our common stock.\nThe government of China could change its policies toward private enterprise or even nationalize or expropriate private enterprises, which could result in the total loss of our and your investment.\nOur business is subject to significant political and economic uncertainties and may be affected by political, economic and social developments in China. Over the past several years, the government of China has pursued economic reform policies including the encouragement of private economic activity and greater economic decentralization. The government of China may not continue to pursue these policies or may significantly alter them to our detriment from time to time with little, if any, prior notice.\nChanges in policies, laws and regulations or in their interpretation or the imposition of confiscatory taxation, restrictions on currency conversion, restrictions or prohibitions on dividend payments to stockholders, or devaluations of currency could all cause a decline in the price of our common stock, should a market for our common stock ever develop. Nationalization or expropriation could even result in the total loss of your investment.\nThe nature and application of many laws of China create an uncertain environment for business operations and they could have a negative effect on us.\n- 23 -\nThe legal system in China is a civil law system. Unlike the common law system, the civil law system is based on written statutes and decided legal cases have little value as precedents. In 1979, China began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and has since introduced many laws and regulations to provide general guidance on economic and business practices in China and to regulate foreign investment. Progress has been made in the promulgation of laws and regulations dealing with economic matters such as corporate organization and governance, foreign investment, commerce, taxation and trade. The promulgation of new laws, changes of existing laws and the abrogation of local regulations by national laws could cause a decline in the price of our common stock. Since these laws, regulations and legal requirements are relatively recent, their interpretation and enforcement involve significant uncertainty.\nAs we import goods into and export goods out of China, fluctuation of the RMB may affect our financial condition by affecting the volume of cross-border money flow.\nAlthough we use the United States dollar (\u201cUSD\u201d) for financial reporting purposes, many of the transactions effected by our operating subsidiaries are denominated in RMB. The value of the RMB fluctuates and is subject to changes in China\u2019s political and economic conditions. We do not currently engage in hedging activities to protect against foreign currency risks. Even if we chose to engage in such hedging activities, we may not be able to do so effectively. Future movements in the exchange rate of the RMB could adversely affect our financial condition as we may suffer financial losses when transferring money raised outside of China into the country or when paying vendors for services performed outside of China.\nWe may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals for our products.\nThe manufacture and sale of our products in China are regulated by China and the local provincial governments. Although our licenses and regulatory filings are current, the uncertain legal environment in China and our industry may be vulnerable to local government agencies or other parties who wish to renegotiate the terms and conditions of, or terminate their agreements or other understandings with us.\nIt will be extremely difficult to acquire jurisdiction and enforce liabilities against our officers, directors and assets based in China.\nAs our executive officers and several of our directors, including the chairman of our Board of Directors, are Chinese citizens, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to acquire jurisdiction over these persons in the event a lawsuit is initiated against us and/or our officers and directors by a stockholder or group of stockholders in the United States. Also, because our operating subsidiaries and assets are located in China, it may be extremely difficult or impossible for one to access those assets to enforce judgments rendered against us or our directors or executive officers by United States courts. In addition, the courts in China may not permit the enforcement of judgments arising out of United States federal and state corporate, securities or similar laws. Accordingly, United States investors may not be able to enforce judgments against us for violation of United States securities laws.\nRecent PRC regulations relating to acquisitions of PRC companies by foreign entities may create regulatory uncertainties that could restrict or limit our ability to operate. Our failure to obtain required prior approval for the share exchange, reverse merger and the listing and trading of our common stock could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, reputation and trading price of our common stock.\nThe PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or \u201cSAFE,\u201d issued a public notice in November 2005, known as Circular 75, concerning the use of offshore holding companies controlled by PRC residents in mergers and acquisitions in China. This circular requires that (1) a PRC resident shall register with a local branch of the SAFE before he or she establishes or controls an overseas special purpose vehicle, or \u201cSPV,\u201d for the purpose of overseas equity financing (including convertible debt financing); (2) when a PRC resident contributes the assets of or his or her equity interests in a domestic enterprise to an SPV, or engages in overseas financing after contributing assets or equity interests to an SPV, such PRC resident must register his or her interest in the SPV and any changes in such interest with a local branch of the SAFE; and (3) when the SPV undergoes a material change outside of China, such as a change in share capital or merger or acquisition, the PRC resident shall, within 30 days from the occurrence of the event that triggers the change, register such change with a local branch of the SAFE. In addition, SAFE issued updated internal implementing rules, or the Implementing Rules in relation to Circular 75. The Implementing Rules were promulgated and became effective on May 29, 2007. Such Implementing Rules provide more detailed provisions and requirements regarding the overseas investment foreign exchange registration procedures. However, even after the promulgation of Implementing Rules there still exist uncertainties regarding the SAFE registration for PRC residents\u2019 interests in overseas companies. If any PRC resident stockholder of a SPV fails to make the required SAFE registration and amended registration, the onshore PRC subsidiaries of that offshore company may be prohibited from distributing their profits and the proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to the offshore entity. Our PRC resident beneficial holders have not completed such approvals and registrations required by the SAFE regulations. Failure to comply with the SAFE registration and amendment requirements described above could result in liability under PRC laws for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions. Because of uncertainty in how the SAFE notice will be interpreted and enforced, we cannot be sure how it will affect our business operations or future plans. For example, our PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to conduct foreign exchange activities, such as the remittance of dividends and foreign currency-denominated borrowings, may be subject to compliance with the SAFE notice by our PRC resident beneficial holders over whom we have no control. In addition, we cannot assure you that such PRC residents will be able to complete the necessary approval and registration procedures required by the SAFE regulations. Failure by any PRC resident beneficial holder to register as required with the relevant branch of SAFE could subject these PRC resident beneficial holders to fines or legal sanctions, restrict our overseas or cross-border investment activities, limit our PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make distributions or pay dividends or affect our ownership structure, which could adversely affect our business and prospects.\n- 24 -\nOn August 8, 2006, the PRC Ministry of Commerce (\u201cMOFCOM\u201d), joined by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, the State Administration of Taxation, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (\u201cCSRC\u201d) and SAFE, released a substantially amended version of the Provisions for Foreign Investors to Merge with or Acquire Domestic Enterprises (the \u201cRevised M&A Regulations\u201d), which took effect September 8, 2006. These new rules significantly revised China\u2019s regulatory framework governing onshore-to-offshore restructurings and foreign acquisitions of domestic enterprises. These new rules signify greater PRC government attention to cross-border merger, acquisition and other investment activities, by confirming MOFCOM as a key regulator for issues related to mergers and acquisitions in China and requiring MOFCOM approval of a broad range of merger, acquisition and investment transactions. Further, the new rules establish reporting requirements for acquisition of control by foreigners of companies in key industries, and reinforce the ability of the Chinese government to monitor and prohibit foreign control transactions in key industries.\nAmong other things, the Revised M&A Regulations include new provisions that purport to require that an offshore special purpose vehicle, or a SPV, formed for listing purposes and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals must obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such SPV\u2019s securities on an overseas stock exchange. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published on its official website procedures specifying documents and materials required to be submitted to it by SPVs seeking CSRC approval of their overseas listings. However, the application of this PRC regulation remains unclear with no consensus currently existing among the leading PRC law firms regarding the scope and applicability of the CSRC approval requirement.\nAccording to the M&A Regulations, a \u201cRelated Party Acquisition\u201d is defined as having taken place when a PRC business that is owned by PRC individual(s) is sold to a non-PRC entity that is established or controlled, directly or indirectly, by those same PRC individual(s). Under the M&A Regulations, any Related Party Acquisition must be approved by MOFCOM and any indirect arrangement or series of arrangements which achieves the same end result without the approval of MOFCOM is a violation of PRC law.\nThe PRC regulatory authorities may take the view that the acquisition by us from Sino Palace of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of each of Shiner Industrial and Shiny-day, Hainan Hi-Tech and Zhuhai in exchange for the issuance of an aggregate of 16,500,000 shares of our common stock to the stockholders of Sino Palace was a Related Party Acquisition, because at the end of these transactions, PRC individuals become majority owners and effective controlling parties of a foreign entity that acquired ownership of PRC subsidiaries. If the PRC regulatory authorities take the view that the acquisition of the PRC subsidiaries constituted a Related Party Acquisition without the approval of the national offices of MOFCOM, they could invalidate our acquisition and ownership of these entities. Additionally, the PRC regulatory authorities may take the view that the share exchange constitutes a transaction which requires the prior approval of the CSRC. If this takes place, we would attempt to find a way to re-establish control of the PRC subsidiaries\u2019 business operations through a series of contractual arrangements rather than an outright purchase of PRC subsidiaries. But we cannot assure you that any such contractual arrangements will be protected by PRC law or that the Company can receive as complete or effective economic benefit and overall control of the PRC subsidiaries\u2019 business than if the Company had direct ownership of these subsidiaries. In addition, we cannot assure you that any such contractual arrangements can be successfully effected under PRC law. If we cannot obtain MOFCOM or CSRC approval if required by the PRC regulatory authorities to do so, and if we cannot put in place or enforce relevant contractual arrangements as an alternative and equivalent means of control of PRC subsidiaries, our business and financial performance will be materially adversely affected.\nIf the CSRC approval is not obtained, we may face regulatory actions or other sanctions from the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies. These regulatory agencies may impose fines and penalties on our operations in the PRC, limit our operating privileges in the PRC, delay or restrict the repatriation of the proceeds from any financings into the PRC, or take other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects, as well as the trading price of our common stock. The CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies also may take actions requiring us, or making it advisable for us, to halt the proposed public offering before settlement and delivery of the common stock offered thereby. Consequently, if investors engage in market trading or other activities in anticipation of and prior to settlement and delivery, they do so at the risk that settlement and delivery may not occur.\nAny uncertainties and/or negative publicity regarding this CSRC approval requirement could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock. Furthermore, published news reports in China recently indicated that the CSRC may have curtailed or suspended overseas listings for Chinese private companies. These news reports have created further uncertainty regarding the approach that the CSRC and other PRC regulators may take with respect to us.\n- 25 -\nIt is uncertain how our business operations or future strategy will be affected by the interpretations and implementation of the aforementioned rules and regulations. It is anticipated that application of the new rules will be subject to significant administrative interpretation, and we will need to closely monitor how MOFCOM and other ministries apply the rules to ensure that our domestic and offshore activities continue to comply with PRC law. Given the uncertainties regarding interpretation and application of the new rules, we may need to expend significant time and resources to maintain compliance.\nOur labor costs are likely to increase as a result of changes in Chinese labor laws.\nWe expect to experience an increase in our cost of labor due to recent changes in Chinese labor laws which are likely to increase costs further and impose restrictions on our relationship with our employees. In June 2007, the National People\u2019s Congress of the PRC enacted new labor law legislation called the Labor Contract Law and more strictly enforcing existing labor laws. The new labor law, which became effective on January 1, 2008, amended and formalized workers\u2019 rights concerning overtime hours, pensions, layoffs, employment contracts and the role of trade unions. Generally, this labor law increased our cost of labor. In addition, under the new law, employees who either have worked for the Company for 10 years or more or who have had two consecutive fixed-term contracts must be given an \u201copen-ended employment contract\u201d that, in effect, constitutes a lifetime, permanent contract, which is terminable only in the event the employee materially breaches the Company\u2019s rules and regulations or is in serious dereliction of his duty. Such non-cancelable employment contracts will substantially increase its employment related risks and limit the Company\u2019s ability to downsize its workforce in the event of an economic downturn. No assurance can be given that the Company will not in the future be subject to labor strikes or that it will not have to make other payments to resolve future labor issues caused by the new laws.\nFurthermore, there can be no assurance that the labor laws will not change further or that their interpretation and implementation will vary, which may have a negative effect upon our business and results of operations.\nInflation in the PRC could negatively affect our profitability and growth.\nWhile the PRC economy has experienced rapid growth, such growth has been uneven among various sectors of the economy and in different geographical areas of the country. Rapid economic growth can lead to growth in the money supply and rising inflation. Furthermore, in order to control inflation in the past, the PRC government has imposed controls on bank credits, limits on loans for fixed assets and restrictions on state bank lending. In January 2010, the Chinese government took steps to tighten the availability of credit including ordering banks to increase the amount of reserves they hold and to reduce or limit their lending. The implementation of such policies may impede economic growth. In 2004, the People\u2019s Bank of China, or the PBOC, the PRC\u2019s central bank, raised interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade and indicated in a statement that the measure was prompted by inflationary concerns in the Chinese economy. Since then, the PBOC has raised rates to restrain inflation and limit the risk of asset bubbles, including the most recent rate hikes in connection with the global economic crisis. Repeated rises in interest rates by the PBOC would likely slow economic activity in China which could, in turn, materially increase our costs and also reduce demand for our products and services.\nFailure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nAs our ultimate holding company is a Nevada corporation, we are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Foreign companies, including some that may compete with us, are not subject to these prohibitions. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices may occur from time-to-time in the PRC. We can make no assurance, however, that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny outbreak of the Swine Flu (H1N1), severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, the Avian Flu, or another widespread public health problem in the PRC could adversely affect our operations.\nThere have been recent outbreaks of the highly pathogenic Swine Flu, caused by the H1N1 virus, in certain regions of the world, including parts of China, where all of our manufacturing facilities are located and where all of our sales occur. Our business is dependent upon our ability to continue to manufacture and distribute our products, and an outbreak of the Swine Flu, or a renewed outbreak of SARS, the Avian Flu, or another widespread public health problem in China, could have a negative effect on our operations. Any such outbreak could have an impact on our operations as a result of:\n- 26 -\n\u2022 quarantines or closures of our manufacturing or distribution facilities or offices;\n\u2022 quarantines or closures of the manufacturing or distribution facilities or officers of our suppliers or customers;\n\u2022 the sickness or death of our key officers and employees; and\n\u2022 a general slowdown in the Chinese economy.\nAny of the foregoing events or other unforeseen consequences of public health problems could adversely affect our operations.\nWe face risks related to natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other events in China that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other events in China. The Hainan province in which we operate is prone to typhoons and flooding. Earthquakes, tsunamis and other storms that may occur in China may impact our distribution capabilities and those of our suppliers. Any future natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other events in China could cause severe disruptions to our operations, as well as those of our suppliers and customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nBecause our business is located in the PRC, we may have difficulty establishing adequate management, legal and financial controls, which we are required to do in order to comply with US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cUS GAAP\u201d) and securities laws, and which could cause a materially adverse impact on our financial statements, the trading of our common stock and our business.\nPRC companies have historically not adopted a Western style of management and financial reporting concepts and practices, which includes strong corporate governance, internal controls and, computer, financial and other control systems. Most of our middle and top management staff are not educated and trained in the Western system, and we may have difficulty hiring new employees in the PRC with experience and expertise relating to US GAAP and US public-company reporting requirements. In addition, we may have difficulty in hiring and retaining a sufficient number of qualified employees to work in the PRC. As a result of these factors, we may experience difficulty in establishing management, legal and financial controls, collecting financial data and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet Western standards. Therefore, we may, in turn, experience difficulties in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This may result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls which could impact the reliability of our financial statements and prevent us from complying with SEC rules and regulations and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any such deficiencies, material weaknesses or lack of compliance could result in restatements of our historical financial information, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, have an adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock, adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets and our ability to recruit personnel, lead to the delisting of our securities from the stock exchange on which they are traded, lead to litigation claims, thereby diverting management\u2019s attention and resources, and which may lead to the payment of damages to the extent such claims are not resolved in our favor, lead to regulatory proceedings, which may result in sanctions, monetary or otherwise, and have a materially adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nContract drafting, interpretation and enforcement in China involve significant uncertainty.\nWe have entered into numerous contracts governed by PRC law, many of which are material to our business. As compared with contracts in the United States, contracts governed by PRC law tend to contain less detail and are not as comprehensive in defining contracting parties\u2019 rights and obligations. As a result, contracts in China are more vulnerable to disputes and legal challenges. In addition, contract interpretation and enforcement in China is not as developed as in the United States, and the result of any contract dispute is subject to significant uncertainties. Therefore, we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to disputes under our material contracts, and if such disputes arise, we cannot assure you that we will prevail.\nUnder the new Enterprise Tax Law, we may be classified as a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d of China for tax purpose, which may subject us and/or our subsidiaries to PRC income tax on taxable global income.\nUnder the new PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law (the \u201cNew EIT Law\u201d) and its implementing rules, both of which became effective on January 1, 2008. Under the New EIT Law, enterprises are classified as resident enterprises and non-resident enterprises. An enterprise established outside of China with its \u201cde facto management bodies\u201d located within China is considered a \u201cresident enterprise,\u201d meaning that it can be treated in a manner similar to a Chinese domestic enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes.\nThe implementing rules of the New EIT Law define de facto management body as a managing body that in practice exercises \u201csubstantial and overall management and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties\u201d of the enterprise. Due to the short history of the New EIT law and lack of applicable legal precedents, it remains unclear how the PRC tax authorities will determine the PRC tax resident treatment of a foreign company such as us, with all of the members of its management located in China. If the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, we may be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income, as well as PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations.\n- 27 -\nWe are actively monitoring the possibility of \u201cresident enterprise\u201d treatment for the applicable tax years and are evaluating appropriate organizational changes to avoid this treatment, to the extent possible. If we are required to pay income tax on our worldwide income at the 25% tax rate, the amount of dividends we could, if any, pay to our stockholders would be materially reduced.\nIf we were treated as a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d by PRC tax authorities, we would be subject to taxation in both the US and China, and our PRC tax may not be credited against our US tax. As a result of the New EIT Law, our historical operating results will not be indicative of our operating results for future periods and the value of our common stock.\nDividends we receive from our subsidiaries located in the PRC may be subject to PRC withholding tax.\nIf we are not treated as a resident enterprise under the New EIT Law, then dividends that we receive from our Chinese subsidiaries may be subject to PRC withholding tax. The New EIT Law provides that an income tax rate of 20% may be applicable to dividends payable to non-resident investors, which (i) do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC or (ii) have an establishment or place of business in the PRC but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business, to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within the PRC. The State Council of the PRC reduced such rate to 10% through the implementation regulations of the New EIT Law. Further, pursuant to the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement between Hong Kong and Mainland China and the Notice on Certain Issues with Respect to the Enforcement of Dividend Provisions in Tax Treaties issued on February 20, 2009 by the State Administration of Taxation, if the Hong Kong resident enterprise owns more than 25% of the equity interest in a company in China incessantly within 12 months immediately prior to obtaining dividend from such company, the 10% withholding tax on the dividends the Hong Kong resident enterprise received from such company in China is reduced to 5%.\nHowever, based on the Notice on Certain Issues with Respect to the Enforcement of Dividend Provisions in Tax Treaties, if the relevant PRC tax authorities determine, in their discretion, that a company benefits from such reduced income tax rate due to a structure or arrangement that is primarily tax-driven, such PRC tax authorities may adjust the preferential tax treatment; and based on the Notice on the Comprehension and Recognition of Beneficial Owner in Tax Treaties issued on October 27, 2009 by the State Administration of Taxation, funnel companies, which are established for the purpose of evading or reducing tax, transferring or accumulating profits, shall not be recognized as beneficial owner, and thus, are not entitled to the abovementioned reduced income tax rate of 5% under the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement. If we are required under the New EIT Law to pay income tax for any dividends we receive from our PRC subsidiaries, or if our PRC subsidiaries are determined by PRC government authority as receiving benefits from reduced income tax rate due to a structure or arrangement that is primarily tax-driven, it would materially and adversely affect the amount of dividends, if any, we may pay to our stockholders.\nDividends payable by us to our foreign investors and any gain on the sale of our shares may be subject to taxes under PRC tax laws.\nIf dividends payable to stockholders by the Company are treated as income derived from sources within China, then the dividends that stockholders receive from us, and any gain on the sale or transfer of our shares, may be subject to taxes under PRC tax laws.\nUnder the New EIT Law, PRC enterprise income tax at the rate of 20% is applicable to dividends payable by us to our investors that are non-resident enterprises which (i) do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC or (ii) have an establishment or place of business in the PRC but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business, to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within the PRC. The State Council of the PRC reduced such rate to 10% through the implementation regulations of the New EIT Law. Similarly, any gain realized on the transfer of our shares by such investors is also subject to a 10% PRC income tax if such gain is regarded as income derived from sources within China and the Company is considered as a resident enterprise which is domiciled in China for tax purpose. If we are required under the New EIT Law to withhold PRC income tax on our dividends payable to our foreign stockholders or investors who are non-resident enterprises, or if you are required to pay PRC income tax on the transfer or our shares under the circumstances mentioned above, the value of your investment in our shares may be materially and adversely affected.\nIn January 2009, the State Administration of Taxation promulgated the Provisional Measures for the Administration of Withholding of Enterprise Income Tax for Non-resident Enterprises (\u201cMeasures\u201d), pursuant to which, the entities which have the direct obligation to make the following payment to a non-resident enterprise shall be the relevant tax withholders for such non-resident enterprise, and such payment includes: incomes from equity investment (including dividends and other return on investment), interests, rents, royalties, and incomes from assignment of property as well as other incomes subject to enterprise income tax received by non-resident enterprises in China. Further, the Measures provides that in case of equity transfer between two non-resident enterprises which occurs outside China, the non-resident enterprise which receives the equity transfer payment shall, by itself or engage an agent to, file tax declaration with the PRC tax authority located at place of the PRC company whose equity has been transferred, and the PRC company whose equity has been transferred shall assist the tax authorities to collect taxes from the relevant non-resident enterprise. However, it is unclear whether the Measures refer to the equity transfer by a non-resident enterprise which is a direct or an indirect stockholder of the said PRC company. Given these Measures, there is a possibility that the Company may have an obligation to withhold income tax in respect of the dividends paid to non-resident enterprise investors.\n- 28 -\nFurthermore, non-resident individual investors may be required to pay PRC individual income tax at a rate of 20% on interests or dividends payable to the investors or any capital gains realized from the transfer of shares if such gains are deemed income derived from sources within the PRC. Under the PRC Individual Income Tax Law, or IIT Law, non-resident individual refers to an individual who has no domicile in China and does not stay in the territory of China or who has no domicile in China and has stayed in the territory of China for less than one year. Pursuant to the IIT Law and its implementation rules, for purposes of the PRC capital gains tax, the taxable income will be the balance of the total income obtained from the transfer of the shares minus all the costs and expenses that are permitted under PRC tax laws to be deducted from the income. If we are considered a \u2019\u2018resident enterprise\u2019\u2019 and relevant competent PRC tax authorities consider dividends we could pay with respect to our shares and the gains realized from the transfer of our shares to be income derived from sources within the PRC, such gains earned by non-resident individuals may be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of 20%. If we are required under PRC law to withhold PRC income tax on dividends payable to our non-PRC investors that are non-resident individuals or if you are required to pay PRC income tax on the transfer of our shares, the value of your investment in our shares may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe will not be able to complete an acquisition of prospective acquisition targets in the PRC unless their financial statements can be reconciled to US GAAP in a timely manner.\nCompanies based in the PRC may not have properly kept financial books and records that may be reconciled with US GAAP. If we attempt to acquire a significant PRC target company and/or its assets, we would be required to obtain or prepare financial statements of the target that are prepared in accordance with and reconciled to US GAAP. Federal securities laws require that a business combination meeting certain financial significance tests require the public acquirer to prepare and file historical and/or pro forma financial statement disclosure with the SEC. These financial statements must be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to US GAAP and the historical financial statements must be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. If a proposed acquisition target does not have financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with, or that can be reconciled to, US GAAP and audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, we will not be able to acquire that proposed acquisition target. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential acquisition targets with which we may acquire and hinder our ability to expand our retail operations.\nWe face uncertainty from China\u2019s \u201cCircular on Strengthening the Administration of Enterprise Income Tax on Non-Resident Enterprises\u2019 Share Transfer\u201d that was released in December 2009 with retroactive effect from January 1, 2008.\nThe Chinese State Administration of Taxation released a circular (\u201cCircular 698\u201d) on December 10, 2009 that addresses the transfer of shares by nonresident companies. Circular 698, which is effective retroactively to January 1, 2008, may have a significant impact on many companies that use offshore holding companies to invest in China. Pursuant to Circular 698, where the withholding agent does not withhold in accordance with laws or cannot perform the withholding obligation, the non-resident enterprises shall file a tax declaration with the PRC tax authority located at place of the resident enterprise whose equity has been transferred, within seven days since the date of equity transfer provided under the contracts.\nWhere a foreign investor indirectly transfers equity interests in a Chinese resident enterprise by selling the shares in an offshore holding company, and the latter is located in a country or jurisdiction where the effective tax burden is less than 12.5% or where the offshore income of his, her, or its residents is not taxable, the foreign investor is required to provide the tax authority in charge of that Chinese resident enterprise with the relevant information within 30 days of the transfers. Moreover, where a foreign investor indirectly transfers equity interests in a Chinese resident enterprise through an abuse of form of organization and there are no reasonable commercial purposes such that the corporate income tax liability is avoided, the PRC tax authority will have the power to re-assess the nature of the equity transfer and deny the existence of the offshore holding company that is used for tax planning purposes.\nThere is uncertainty as to the application of Circular 698. For example, while the term \u201cindirectly transfer\u201d is not defined, it is understood that the relevant PRC tax authorities have jurisdiction regarding requests for information over a wide range of foreign entities having no direct contact with China. Moreover, the relevant authority has not yet promulgated any formal provisions or formally declared or stated how to calculate the effective tax in the country or jurisdiction and to what extent and the process of the disclosure to the tax authority in charge of that Chinese resident enterprise. In addition, there are not any formal declarations with regard to how to decide abuse of form of organization and reasonable commercial purpose, which can be utilized by us to balance if our company complies with the Circular 698. As a result, we may become at risk of being taxed under Circular 698 and we may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with Circular 698 or to establish that we should not be taxed under Circular 698, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n- 29 -\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR SECURITIES\nThere is not now, and there may not ever be, an active market for our common stock and we cannot assure you that the common stock will become liquid or that it will be listed on a securities exchange.\nThere currently is no active market for our common stock. We plan to list our common stock as soon as practicable. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet the initial listing standards of any stock exchange, or that we will be able to maintain any such listing. Until our common stock is listed on an exchange, we expect that it would be eligible to continue being quoted in the over-the-counter market maintained by the OTC Markets Group Inc. In this venue, however, an investor may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of the common stock and trading of our common stock may be extremely sporadic. For example, several days may pass before any shares may be traded. A more active market for the common stock may never develop. In addition, if we failed to meet the criteria set forth in SEC regulations, various requirements would be imposed by law on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. Consequently, such regulations may deter broker-dealers from recommending or selling the common stock, which may further affect its liquidity. This would also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital.\nWe are subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions that may affect our ability to sell our securities on the secondary market.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations that generally define \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. The market price of our common stock is less than $5.00 per share and therefore is a \u201cpenny stock.\u201d Brokers or dealers effecting transactions in \u201cpenny stock\u201d must disclose certain information concerning the transaction, obtain a written agreement from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities. These rules may restrict the ability of brokers or dealers to sell our common stock and may affect your ability to sell shares. In addition, so long as our common stock is quoted in the \u201cpink sheets\u201d (as is currently the case), investors will find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations of the stock, and may find few buyers to purchase such stock and few market makers to support its price.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock by our stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of our common stock or the availability of shares of common stock for sale will have on the market price prevailing from time to time. Sales of shares of our common stock in the public market covered under an effective registration statement, or the perception that those sales may occur, could cause the trading price of our common stock to decrease or become lower than it might be in the absence of those sales or perceptions.\nShares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market for our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding 90,000 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options at a weighted average exercise price of $0.95 per share, and 521,664 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of our outstanding warrants at a weighted average exercise price of $1.70 per share. If or when these securities are exercised into shares of our common stock, the number of our shares of common stock outstanding will increase. Increases in the number of our outstanding shares and any sales of shares could have an adverse effect on the trading activity and market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, from time to time, certain of our shareholders may be eligible to sell all, or a portion of, their shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, or under effective resale prospectuses. Any substantial sale of our common stock pursuant to Rule 144 or any resale prospectus may have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\nWe may issue additional shares of our capital stock or debt securities to raise capital or complete acquisitions, which would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of up to 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share. There are currently 47,396,664 authorized and unissued shares of our common stock that have not been reserved and are available for future issuance. Although we have no commitments as of the date of this offering to issue our securities, we may issue a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock to complete a business combination, to raise capital or to compensate our employees and/or directors. The issuance of additional shares of our common stock:\n- 30 -\n\u2022 may significantly reduce the equity interest of investors in this offering; and\n\u2022 may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nOur directors and senior management own a significant amount of our common stock, giving them influence or control in corporate transactions and other matters, and their interests could differ from those of other stockholders.\nThe Chairman of our board of directors owns approximately 41.22% of our outstanding common stock and, together with our other directors and senior management, they own approximately 41.65% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, they are in a position to significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote, including the election of directors, the adoption of any amendment to our articles of incorporation or bylaws, and the approval of significant corporate transactions. Their control may delay or prevent a change of control on terms favorable to our other stockholders and may adversely affect your voting and other stockholders rights.\nThe ability of our Chinese operating subsidiaries to pay dividends may be restricted due to foreign exchange control and other regulations of China.\nUnder applicable PRC regulations, foreign-invested enterprises in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a foreign-invested enterprise in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year to its general reserves until the accumulative amount of such reserves reach 50% of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. The board of directors of a foreign-invested enterprise has the discretion to allocate a portion of its after-tax profits to staff welfare and bonus funds, which may not be distributed to equity owners except in the event of liquidation.\nFurthermore, the ability of our Chinese operating subsidiaries to pay dividends may be restricted due to the foreign exchange control policies and availability of cash balance of the Chinese operating subsidiaries. Because substantially all of our operations are conducted in China and a substantial majority of our revenues are generated in China, a majority of our revenue being earned and currency received are denominated in RMB. RMB is subject to the exchange control regulation in China, and, as a result, we may unable to distribute any dividends outside of China due to PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into USD.\nOur inability to receive dividends or other payments from our Chinese operating subsidiaries could adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends, or otherwise fund and conduct our business. The funds of our Chinese operating subsidiaries may not be readily available to us to satisfy obligations which have been incurred outside the PRC, which could adversely affect our business and prospects or our ability to meet our cash obligations. Accordingly, if we do not receive dividends from our Chinese operating subsidiaries, our liquidity, financial condition and ability to make dividend distributions to our stockholders will be materially and adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 92553, "SIC": 2670, "TIC": "UECN"}
