The following is a description of some important factors that may cause our results of operations or financial condition in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business is affected by general economic conditions in the United States, Europe and the other regions in which we operate, and unfavorable global economic conditions or instability in the capital and credit markets could adversely impact our business.\nWith operations in many parts of the world, the global economy has a significant impact on our business. Unfavorable economic conditions in the United States, Europe and other regions in which we operate, and volatility in the global capital and credit markets, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, a deterioration of global economic conditions, or a prolonged period of market instability, could present the following additional risks and uncertainties for our business:\n\u2022\na reduction in revenues from and/or less favorable pricing or terms with new and existing customers;\n\u2022\nthe inability to expand our customer base in existing or new markets;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in collecting trade accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nan increase in product prices from our suppliers that we are not able to pass through to our customers;\n\u2022\nan acceleration of payment terms with our suppliers and/or the imposition of more restrictive credit terms and other contractual requirements;\n\u2022\nan increased risk of excess and obsolete inventory;\n\u2022\na reduction in research, development or production spending by our customers, especially those in the Biopharma industry;\n\u2022\nthe inability to access additional capital or refinance existing indebtedness;\n\u2022\na limited availability to enter into new derivative financial instruments; and\n\u2022\nthe need to record impairment charges against our goodwill, other intangible and/or other long-lived assets.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed if our customers discontinue, outsource or spend less on research, development and production and other scientific endeavors or discontinue or lessen their relationship with us.\nOur customers are engaged in research, development and production in the Biopharma, agricultural, chemical, environmental, food and beverage, healthcare, microelectronic and petrochemical industries as well as in the education and government sectors. The amount of customer spending on research, development and production has a large impact on our sales and profitability. Our customers determine the amounts that they will spend on the basis of, among other things, general economic conditions, their financial condition and liquidity, spending priorities and their need to develop new products, which, in turn, is dependent upon a number of factors, including their competitors\u2019 research, development and production initiatives.\nIn addition, consolidation in the industries in which our customers operate may have an impact on such spending as customers integrate acquired operations, including research and development departments and their budgets. Our customers finance their research and development spending from private and public sources. Government funding of scientific research and education has varied for several reasons, including general economic conditions, growth in population, political priorities, changes in the number of students and other demographic changes.\nA deterioration in general economic conditions or a return to a period of economic contraction could result in reductions, or further reductions as the case may be, in spending by our customers across all customer segments that we serve, including the Biopharma industry as our largest customer segment. In addition, certain of our customers who depend on U.S. federal funding to finance their scientific research may be adversely impacted by U.S. federal spending cuts required by the \u201csequestration\u201d mechanism in the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. The sequestration mechanism, which went into effect in March 2013, creates limits on discretionary federal spending. While the Congressional Budget Office has determined that the budgetary cuts required by sequestration have not been triggered in 2014 through 2016, there can be no assurances that sequestration is not triggered in any subsequent years. A reduction in spending by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe substantial majority of our 50 largest customer relationships are governed by three to five year contracts that typically include pricing and volume incentives intended to position us as the primary provider of laboratory products and services. These contracts typically do not contain minimum purchase requirements or provide us with an exclusive supplier relationship during the term of such contract. In many cases, our customers will undertake a competitive process at the expiration of these contracts and have on occasion not selected us to continue as their provider of laboratory products and services. The loss of one or more of our large customers, a material reduction in their purchase of products or services from us, extended disruptions or interruptions in their operations or material changes in the terms based on which we sell to them, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe life science industry has and will continue to experience significant changes that could adversely affect our business.\nMany of our customers in the life science industry have experienced significant changes in the last several years and are expected to continue to experience significant changes, including reductions in governmental payments for pharmaceutical products, expirations of significant patents, lower funding for research and development and adverse changes in legislation or regulations regarding the delivery or pricing of general healthcare services or mandated benefits. In response to these and other changes, some of our life science customers have implemented or may in the future implement actions in an effort to control and reduce costs, including:\n\u2022\ndevelopment of large and sophisticated group purchasing organizations that reduces spending on laboratory products;\n\u2022\nconsolidation of pharmaceutical companies resulting in a rationalization of research expenditures;\n\u2022\npurchasing the products that we supply directly from manufacturers;\n\u2022\nclosing of domestic facilities and the establishment of facilities at low-cost offshore locations; and\n\u2022\nsignificant reductions in and/or outsourcing of research, development and production activities, including outsourcing to low-cost offshore locations.\nThe ability of our life science customers to develop new products to replace revenue decreases attributable to expirations of significant patents, along with the impact of other past or potential future changes in the general healthcare industry may result in our customers significantly reducing their purchases of products and services from us or the prices they are willing to pay for those products or services. In addition, we will need to adapt our business to maintain existing customer relationships and develop new customer relationships as our customers consolidate or outsource certain activities domestically or to low-cost offshore locations.\nWe compete in a highly competitive market. Failure to compete successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe compete in the global laboratory products market, primarily with Fisher Scientific, which has a portion of its business dedicated to the distribution of laboratory products and services. We also compete with many smaller regional, local and specialty distributors, as well as with manufacturers of all sizes selling directly to their customers. Competitive factors include price, service and delivery, breadth of product line, customer support, e-business capabilities, service offerings and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers.\nA few of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. Most of our products are available from several sources, and some of our customers have relationships with several distributors. Our agreements with customers generally provide that the customer can terminate the agreement or reduce the scope of products or services provided pursuant to the agreement with little or no notice. Lack of product availability, stemming from either our inability to acquire products or interruptions in the supply of products from manufacturers, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete. Our competitors could also obtain exclusive rights to distribute some products, thereby foreclosing our ability to distribute these products. Vertically integrated distributors may also have an advantage with respect to the total delivered product cost of certain of their captive products. Additionally, manufacturers could increase their efforts to sell directly to consumers and effectively bypass distributors like us. Consolidation in the global laboratory products market could result in existing competitors increasing their market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The entry of new participants in the industry could also have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete.\nWe are subject to currency risks with respect to our international operations.\nWe report our consolidated financial results in U.S. dollars. A significant portion of our results are from our operations outside the United States and denominated in foreign currencies (principally the euro, the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar and the Swiss franc). Fluctuations in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and could adversely affect our operating results. Specifically, during times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported international sales and earnings will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer U.S. dollars.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations depend upon maintaining our relationships with suppliers.\nWe offer products from a wide range of suppliers. While there is generally more than one source of supply for most of the categories of products that we sell, we currently do not manufacture the majority of our products and are dependent on these suppliers for access to those products. Our ability to sustain our gross margins has been, and will continue to be, dependent in part upon our ability to obtain favorable terms from our suppliers. These terms may change from time to time, and such changes could adversely affect our gross margins over time. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted by the acceleration of payment terms to our suppliers and/or the imposition of more restrictive credit terms and other contractual requirements.\nSome of our competitors are increasing their manufacturing operations both internally and through acquisitions of manufacturers, including manufacturers that supply products to us. In addition, we manufacture certain products that may compete directly with products we source from our suppliers. To date, we have not experienced an adverse impact on our ability to continue to source products from manufacturers that have been vertically integrated or otherwise compete with us, although there is no assurance that we will not experience such an impact in the future.\nThe loss of one or more of our large suppliers, a material reduction in their supply of products or provision of services to us, extended disruptions or interruptions in their operations or material changes in the terms we obtain from them, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future operating results may fluctuate significantly and our current operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance. Fluctuations in our quarterly financial results could affect our stock price in the future.\nOur net sales and operating results have historically varied from period-to-period, and we expect that they will continue to do so as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. If our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors, our stock price could be negatively affected. Any volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock. Our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of future performance.\nPart of our growth strategy is to engage in acquisitions, which will subject us to a variety of risks that could harm our business.\nAs part of our business strategy, we intend to continue to review and complete selective acquisition opportunities focusing initially in North America and Europe and, over the longer term, in other select geographies. There can be no assurances that we will be able to complete suitable acquisitions for a variety of reasons, including the identification of and competition for acquisition targets, the need for regulatory approvals, the inability of the parties to agree to the structure or purchase price of the transaction and our inability to finance the transaction on commercially acceptable terms. In addition, any completed acquisition will subject us to a variety of other risks, including:\n\u2022\nwe will need to allocate substantial operational, financial and management resources in integrating new businesses, technologies and products, and management may encounter difficulties in integrating the operations, personnel or systems of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nacquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business relationships with existing or future suppliers, in particular, to the extent we consummate acquisitions that vertically integrate portions of our business;\n\u2022\nwe may assume substantial actual or contingent liabilities, known and unknown;\n\u2022\nacquisitions may not meet our expectations of future financial performance;\n\u2022\nwe may experience delays or reductions in realizing expected synergies;\n\u2022\nwe may incur substantial unanticipated costs or encounter other problems associated with acquired businesses or devote time and capital investigating a potential acquisition and not complete the transaction;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to achieve our intended objectives for the transaction; and\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to retain the key personnel, customers and suppliers of the acquired business.\nIn addition, we may be unable to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies as we attempt to integrate the acquired businesses, and this may lead to operational inefficiencies. These factors related to our acquisition strategy, among others, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe international scope of our operations may adversely affect our business.\nWe are continuing to expand our sourcing, commercial operations and administrative activities internationally, and we derive a significant portion of our net sales from operations outside the United States. Our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally require considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal and regulatory systems, alternative dispute systems and commercial markets. Expansion has required and will continue to require us to invest significant funds and other resources. Accordingly, we face certain risks, including:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on foreign ownership of subsidiaries;\n\u2022\ntariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions;\n\u2022\noperating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;\n\u2022\ndiffering laws or administrative practices;\n\u2022\nrecruiting and retaining talented and capable employees in foreign countries and maintaining our corporate culture across all geographies;\n\u2022\nbusiness practices that are inconsistent with local or U.S. law, such as the FCPA, or other applicable anti-bribery regulations;\n\u2022\nviolating sanctions established by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, with respect to threats to the national security, foreign policy or the economy of the United States;\n\u2022\npolitical risks;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in the efficiency and effectiveness of, and difficulty in overseeing and managing, operations, supply chain and certain important administrative functions, including those that have been or in the future may be transferred to our shared services operations;\n\u2022\nrestrictions imposed by foreign governments on international cash transfers;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences of operating in multiple international jurisdictions.\nIn addition, an adverse change in laws or administrative practices in countries within which we operate could have a material adverse effect on us. Our operations outside the United States also may present additional risk with respect to compliance with government regulations and licensing requirements. If we are unable to manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nIn recent years, we incurred, and we may in the future incur, impairment charges related to our goodwill and other intangible assets, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe carry significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets, including indefinite-lived intangible assets, on our balance sheet as a result of our 2007 merger and subsequent acquisitions. Our intangible assets with finite useful lives primarily relate to customer and supplier relationships and are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets relate to certain of our trademarks and tradenames.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized and are tested annually for impairment, and they must also be tested for impairment between the annual tests if an event or change in circumstance occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Other amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever an indication of potential impairment exists.\nSee Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Testing Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for Impairment\u201d for more information.\nAs of December 31, 2015, goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately $3.2 billion or 68% of our total assets. We may recognize additional impairment charges in the future should our operating results, market conditions or fair value assumptions decline due to, among other things, ongoing or worsening economic instability and volatility or other macroeconomic or industry-specific pressures, including but not limited to rising interest rates.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in sales to these customers or penalties.\nWe sell products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.\nIf we do not comply with existing government regulations or if we or our suppliers become subject to more onerous government regulations, we could be adversely affected.\nSome of the products we offer and our operations are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production, handling, transportation, storage, import, export and distribution of chemicals, drugs and other similar products, including the operating and security standards of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, the Food and Drug Administration, the Bureau of Industry and Security and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies. In addition, our operational activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration and similar foreign agencies. We are also required to abide by the anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws of all countries in which we operate, including the FCPA. While we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations, any non-compliance could result in substantial fines, penalties or assessments or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive products and solutions and thereby have an adverse impact on our financial condition. We cannot assure you that existing laws and regulations will not be revised or that new, more restrictive laws will not be adopted or become applicable to us or the products that we manufacture and distribute.\nIf our suppliers become subject to more stringent laws, they may seek to recover any or all increased costs of compliance from us by increasing prices, and we may not be able to recover all such increased prices from our customers. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our business and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected by future changes in applicable laws and regulations applicable to our suppliers.\nIf any of our operations are found not to comply with applicable antitrust or competition laws, our business may suffer.\nOur operations are subject to applicable antitrust and competition laws in the countries in which we conduct our business, in particular in the United States and in the European Union. These laws prohibit, among other things, anticompetitive agreements and practices. If any of our commercial agreements are found to violate or infringe upon such laws, we may be subject to civil and other penalties and third party claims for damages. Further, agreements that infringe upon these laws may be void and unenforceable, in whole or in part, or require modification in order to be lawful and enforceable. If we are unable to enforce any of our commercial agreements, whether at all or in material part, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and costs to comply with such laws and regulations, or any liability or obligation imposed under such laws or regulations, could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to a broad range of foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those pertaining to air emissions, water discharges, the manufacturing, handling, disposal and transport of hazardous materials and solid waste, the investigation and remediation of contamination and otherwise relating to health and safety and the protection of the environment and natural resources. As our global operations have involved and continue to involve the manufacturing, handling, transport and distribution of materials that are, or could be classified as toxic or hazardous, there is a risk of contamination and environmental damage inherent in our operations and the products we manufacture, handle, transport and distribute. Our environmental, health and safety liabilities and obligations may result in significant capital expenditures and other costs, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be fined or penalized by regulators for failing to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. In addition, contamination resulting from our current or past operations may trigger investigation or remediation obligations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBased on current information, we believe that any costs we may incur relating to environmental, health and safety matters will not be material. We cannot be certain, however, that identification of presently unidentified environmental, health and safety conditions, new regulations, more vigorous enforcement by regulatory authorities or other unanticipated events will not arise in the future and give rise to additional environmental liabilities, business interruptions, compliance costs or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are constantly evolving and it is not possible to predict accurately the effect they, or any new regulations or legislation may have in future periods.\nWe are subject to product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business.\nOur business involves risk of product liability, patent infringement and other claims in the ordinary course of business arising from the products that we source from various manufacturers or produce ourselves, as well as from the services we provide. Our exposure to such claims may increase as we seek to increase the geographic scope of our sourcing activities and sales of private label products and to the extent that we expand our manufacturing operations. We maintain insurance policies, including product liability insurance, and in many cases the manufacturers of the products we distribute have indemnified us against such claims. We cannot assure you that our insurance coverage or indemnification agreements with manufacturers will be available in all pending or any future cases brought against us. Furthermore, our ability to recover under any insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject to the financial viability of our insurers, our manufacturers and our manufacturers\u2019 insurers, as well as legal enforcement under the local laws governing the arrangements. In particular, as we seek to expand our sourcing from manufacturers in Asia-Pacific and other developing locations, we expect that we will increase our exposure to potential defaults under the related indemnification arrangements. Insurance coverage in general or coverage for certain types of liabilities, such as product liability or patent infringement in these developing markets may not be readily available for purchase or cost-effective for us to purchase. Furthermore, insurance for liability relating to asbestos, lead and silica exposure is not available, and we do not maintain insurance for product recalls. Accordingly, we could be subject to uninsured and unindemnified future liabilities, and an unfavorable result in a case for which adequate insurance or indemnification is not available could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also involved in various disputes, litigation and regulatory matters incidental to our business, including employment matters, commercial disputes, government contract compliance matters, disputes regarding environmental clean-up costs, and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves in such matters. From time to time, we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of laboratory supplies, including litigation resulting from the alleged prior distribution of products containing asbestos by certain of our predecessors or acquired companies. While the impact of this litigation has historically been immaterial, there can be no assurance that the impact of the pending and any future claims will not be material to our business, financial condition or results of operations in the future.\nIf we are unable to hire, train and retain key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in large part upon our continuing ability to identify, hire, retain and motivate skilled professionals. We face intense competition for these professionals from our competitors, customers, suppliers and other companies within the industries in which we compete and the geographical regions in which we operate. Any failure on our part to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified professionals could have a significant adverse impact on our business.\nWe depend heavily on the services of our senior management. We believe that our future success will depend upon the continued services of our senior management. Our business may be harmed by the loss of one or more members of our senior management. We currently do not maintain key-man life insurance with respect to our executive officers.\nWe rely upon our distribution centers and third parties to ship products to our customers, and significant interruptions in the operations of our distribution centers or the operations of such third parties could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur infrastructure primarily consists of strategically located distribution centers and various smaller regional service centers where we receive products from manufacturers, manage inventory and fill and ship customer orders. We also ship a significant amount of our orders through various independent package delivery providers. Prompt shipment of our products is important to our business. Any significant disruptions to the operations of our distribution centers or such third parties for any reason, including labor relations issues, power interruptions, severe weather, fire or other circumstances beyond the control of us or such third parties, could cause our operating expenses to increase or seriously harm our ability to fulfill our customers\u2019 orders or deliver products on a timely basis, or both. In addition, an increase in prices by our third party carriers, due to increases in fuel prices or otherwise, could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to find alternative providers or make adjustments to our selling prices.\nProblems with or failure of our information services and their connectivity to our customers, suppliers and/or certain service providers could significantly disrupt our operations, which could reduce our customer or supplier base and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur businesses rely on sophisticated information systems to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of millions of inventory items from numerous distribution centers; to receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis; to account for other product and service transactions with customers; to manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers; and to process payments to suppliers. Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted or damaged by unforeseen events or if they fail for any extended period of time, including due to the actions of third parties. To reduce our risks against unforeseen events, we continually deploy, test and refine disaster recovery and business continuity preparedness plans.\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks. A failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems, or those of our third party service providers, as a result of cyber attacks or information security breaches could disrupt our business and/or our supply chain, result in the improper disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation and/or increase our costs. As a result, cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a high priority for us. Although we believe that we have robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place, as cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nIn addition, we accept payment by credit card and similar payment instruments for a material portion of our sales, and our ability to accept, process and settle credit card transactions is subject to rules and regulations issued and/or amended from time to time by payment card companies, such as American Express, VISA, MasterCard and Discover. These rules and regulations, which vary based on annual transaction volume and transaction experience, require us to safeguard customer information, including applying the minimum security standards for the manner in which we capture, store, process and transmit such information. Our failure to comply with such changing rules and standards can subject us to fines, restrictions or expulsion from these card acceptance programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe maintain enterprise resource planning systems throughout our business and we plan to continue to make technology and infrastructure investments, including with respect to our enterprise resource planning and e-commerce capabilities. Our technology initiatives are designed to enhance the security, confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and systems, to ensure our operations continue to provide a high quality service to our customers and to provide important information to our management. We are continually assessing the risks and costs associated with potential problems and interruptions that could reduce the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations in the near term, looking for opportunities to transfer or share these risks with specialized information systems security providers and insuring against these risks where appropriate. Despite these efforts, the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of our technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce our productivity, including our ability to process orders, ship products, provide services and customer support, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business, as well as disrupt or impair our ability to provide important information to our management and investors.\nWe have not registered and in some cases do not own the existing applications and registrations for our material trademarks or service marks in every country in which we do business.\nWe serve our customers globally through our operations in 34 countries and use a number of registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks for our products and services, substantially all of which are owned by us. Although we have registered our material trademarks in the United States and the primary European countries in which we conduct business, we have not registered and in some cases do not own the existing applications and registrations for our material trademarks or service marks in all countries in which we conduct business. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in certain countries, especially those in Asia-Pacific, may only provide us with limited protection. In addition, in some countries, we may be blocked from registering or otherwise protecting certain of our marks by others who have already registered identical or similar marks for similar goods or services, and in those cases, we run the risk of being sued for infringement or being unable to effectively establish brand identity.\nThe failure to own and have enforceable rights in the trademarks and service marks used in our business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnanticipated increases to our income tax liabilities could adversely impact our results of operations.\nAs a global corporation, our business is subject to a wide variety of U.S. federal, state and non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies. There can be no assurance that laws, regulations and policies will not be changed in ways that will impact our income tax provision or our income tax assets and liabilities. We are also subject to income tax audits in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure you that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Tax authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we have a presence and conduct business may disagree with our tax positions and assess additional taxes.\nIn addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. The carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the United States, is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the United States. Increases in our income tax liabilities or risks related to the realization of our deferred tax assets as a result of any of the foregoing could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations.\nAs a U.S. company doing business in international markets through subsidiaries, we are subject to intercompany pricing rules in the jurisdictions where we operate. Tax rates vary from country to country and if regulators determine that our profits in one jurisdiction should be increased, we might not be able to fully offset the adjustment in the other jurisdictions; which would increase our effective tax rate. Additionally, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, has adopted guidelines regarding base erosion and profit shifting. As a result of the adoption by the OECD, individual taxing jurisdictions have also adopted some form of these guidelines as well. As such, we may need to change our approach to intercompany transfer pricing in order to maintain compliance under the new rules. Our effective tax rate may increase or decrease depending on the current location of global operations at the time of the change.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our debt or contractual obligations.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt, which requires us to make significant interest and principal payments. At December 31, 2015, we had outstanding indebtedness of $1,989.0 million, including our senior credit facility, 4.625% senior notes and our A/R Facility. Our high level of debt could have important consequences to us including the following:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt or contractual obligations;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our senior credit facility and our A/R Facility, are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments, which would reduce the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, future business opportunities and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any of our less leveraged competitors;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business and both general and industry-specific adverse economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing at a favorable cost of borrowing, or if at all, to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements.\nDespite current indebtedness levels and restrictive covenants, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which would intensify our leverage risks.\nAlthough the terms of the credit agreement governing the senior credit facility and the indenture governing the 4.625% senior notes restrict us and our restricted subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications, including with respect to our ability to incur additional senior secured debt. The risks that we and our subsidiaries face as a result of our leverage could intensify to the extent that we incur a significant amount of additional indebtedness.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions on our ability to operate our business and to pursue our business strategies, and our failure to comply with, cure breaches of, or obtain waivers for covenants could result in an acceleration of the due date of our indebtedness.\nThe credit agreement governing our senior credit facility and the indenture governing the 4.625% senior notes contain, and agreements governing future debt issuances may contain, covenants that restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs, to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to engage in other transactions or business activities that may be important to our growth strategy or otherwise important to us. The credit agreement and the indenture restrict, among other things, our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:\n\u2022\nincur or create additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or to make certain other restricted payments;\n\u2022\npurchase or redeem stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nsell assets and subsidiary stock;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that restrict dividends and liens;\n\u2022\nchange our lines of business or our fiscal year; and\n\u2022\nenter into mergers, consolidations and sales of substantially all assets.\nAdditionally, our senior credit facility contains a financial maintenance covenant requiring us to maintain a ratio of first lien indebtedness, net of unrestricted cash to EBITDA, as defined (the \u201cFirst Lien Net Leverage Ratio\u201d) of not more than 4.00:1.00. The financial maintenance covenant is tested at the end of each fiscal quarter. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with the covenants related to our debt in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders or noteholders and/or amend the covenants. In particular, if our financial condition or operating results deteriorate, our relations with our lenders and noteholders may be materially and adversely affected, which could impact our ability to obtain waivers if necessary.\nAny breach of the covenants in the credit agreement or the indenture could result in a default of the obligations under such debt and cause a default under other debt. If there were an event of default under the credit agreement related to our senior credit facility that was not cured or waived, the lenders under our senior credit facility could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the borrowings under the senior credit facility to be due and payable immediately. Our assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our senior credit facility and our obligations under the 4.625% senior notes if accelerated upon an event of default. If, as or when required, we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness under, or amend the covenants contained in, our senior credit facility, the lenders under our senior credit facility could institute foreclosure proceedings against the assets securing borrowings under the senior credit facility. Any such acceleration may also constitute a termination event under our A/R Facility, which could result in the amount outstanding under that facility becoming due and payable.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows or access sufficient additional capital to meet our debt obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or future borrowings under our senior credit facility, our A/R Facility or from other sources may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make required interest payments on our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, including capital expenditure requirements, investments, acquisitions and other transactions that are important to the execution of our business strategy. As our debt matures, we may not be able to refinance our maturing debt on favorable terms, or at all, based on general economic or market conditions, our historical or projected growth or other factors, including those beyond our control. If our cash flow from operations or other liquidity sources are not sufficient to make required interest payments or we are not able to refinance maturing debt on favorable terms, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or debt capital on commercially unreasonable terms or reducing or delaying important business transactions. Our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our 4.625% senior notes restrict our ability to sell assets and use the proceeds from such sales for purposes other than debt payment obligations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nOur common stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and holders of our common stock could lose a significant portion of their investment.\nThe market price for our common stock is likely to be volatile. Our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares of common stock at or above the price at which they purchased their shares, due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock, which may be caused by a number of factors, many of which we cannot control, including those described under \u201cRisks Related to Our Business\u201d and \u201cRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\u201d and the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common stock;\n\u2022\ndowngrades by any securities analysts who follow our common stock;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock by our officers, directors and significant stockholders, including VWR Holdings, which is controlled by Madison Dearborn Partners;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole;\n\u2022\ninvestors\u2019 perceptions of our prospects;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nchanges in key personnel; and\n\u2022\nour limited public float in light of Madison Dearborn Partners\u2019 beneficial ownership of a majority of our common stock, which may result in the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our stockholders having a disproportionate positive or negative influence on the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies, including companies in our industry. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs, and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.\nMadison Dearborn Partners has the ability to control significant corporate activities, and their interests may not coincide with yours.\nAt December 31, 2015, Madison Dearborn Partners beneficially owned, through its control of VWR Holdings, 54% of our common stock. As a result of its beneficial ownership, Madison Dearborn Partners, so long as it continues to beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock, will have the ability to control the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of stockholders and, through the Board, the ability to control decision-making with respect to our business direction and policies. Matters over which Madison Dearborn Partners, directly or indirectly, exercise control include:\n\u2022\nthe election of the Board and the appointment and removal of our officers;\n\u2022\nmergers and other business combination transactions, including proposed transactions that would result in our stockholders receiving a premium price for their shares;\n\u2022\nother acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or assets;\n\u2022\nincurrence of indebtedness and the issuance of equity securities;\n\u2022\nrepurchase of stock and payment of dividends; and\n\u2022\nthe issuance of shares to management under our equity incentive plans.\nEven if Madison Dearborn Partners\u2019 beneficial ownership of our shares falls below a majority, it may continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions. Under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, Madison Dearborn Partners and its affiliates will not have any obligation to present to us, and Madison Dearborn Partners and its affiliates may separately pursue corporate opportunities of which they become aware, even if those opportunities are ones that we would have pursued if granted the opportunity.\nIn addition, we have entered into a Director Nomination Agreement with VWR Holdings that provides VWR Holdings the right to designate nominees for election to our board of directors for so long as VWR Holdings beneficially owns 10% or more of the total number of shares of our common stock then outstanding. The Director Nomination Agreement provides that Madison Dearborn Partners may cause VWR Holdings to assign such right to Madison Dearborn Partners or to a Madison Dearborn Partners\u2019 affiliate so long as Madison Dearborn Partners and its affiliates are the beneficial owners of 50% or more of VWR Holdings\u2019 voting equity interests.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and, as a result, we qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. You do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nMadison Dearborn Partners through its control of VWR Holdings beneficially owns a majority of our common stock. As a result, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the corporate governance standards under NASDAQ. Under the rules of NASDAQ, a company of which more than 50% of the outstanding voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain stock exchange corporate governance requirements, including the requirement that (i) a majority of the Board consist of \u201cindependent directors,\u201d as defined under the rules of NASDAQ, (ii) the Nominating and Governance Committee is composed entirely of independent directors or (iii) the Compensation Committee is composed entirely of independent directors.\nThe NASDAQ independence standards are intended to ensure that directors who meet the independence standards are free of any conflicting interest that could influence their actions as directors. Accordingly, you do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the stock exchange corporate governance requirements.\nConflicts of interest may arise because some of our directors are principals of our largest stockholders.\nEach of Messrs. Alexos and Sullivan, who are officers of Madison Dearborn Partners, and Mr. Kraemer, who is associated with Madison Dearborn Partners, serve on the Board. VWR Holdings, which is controlled by Madison Dearborn Partners, continues to hold a majority of our outstanding common stock. Madison Dearborn Partners and the entities respectively controlled by them may hold equity interests in entities that directly or indirectly compete with us, and companies in which they currently invest may begin competing with us. As a result of these relationships, when conflicts between the interests of Madison Dearborn Partners, on the one hand, and of other stockholders, on the other hand, arise, these directors may not be disinterested. Although our directors and officers have a duty of loyalty to us under Delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, transactions that we enter into in which a director or officer has a conflict of interest are generally permissible so long as (i) the material facts relating to the director\u2019s or officer\u2019s relationship or interest as to the transaction are disclosed to the Board and a majority of our disinterested directors approves the transaction, (ii) the material facts relating to the director\u2019s or officer\u2019s relationship or interest as to the transaction are disclosed to our stockholders and a majority of our disinterested stockholders approve the transaction or (iii) the transaction is otherwise fair to us. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that any principal, officer, member, manager and/or employee of Madison Dearborn Partners or any entity that controls, is controlled by or under common control with Madison Dearborn Partners (other than us or any company that is controlled by us) or a Madison Dearborn Partners-managed investment fund is not required to offer any transaction opportunity of which they become aware to us and could take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to other companies in which they have an investment, unless such opportunity is offered to them solely in their capacities as our directors.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares. On February 18, 2016, 131,419,375 shares of common stock were outstanding. The shares of common stock sold in our IPO and subsequent registered secondary offerings are freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except that any shares of our common stock that may be acquired by our directors, executive officers and other affiliates, as that term is defined in the Securities Act, may be sold only in compliance with certain volume limitations and other restrictions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act.\nThe remaining 70,950,000 shares, representing 54% of our total outstanding shares of common stock, will continue to be \u201crestricted securities\u201d within the meaning of Rule 144 and subject to certain restrictions on resale. Restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they are registered under the Securities Act or are sold pursuant to an exemption from registration such as Rule 144 or Rule 701 under the Securities Act.\nIn the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and as provided under Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable.\nOur charter documents contain provisions that may make it more difficult for us to be acquired without the approval of the Board. These provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors so that not all members of the Board are elected at one time;\n\u2022\ngenerally prohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders, except that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders may be effected by written consent until such time as Madison Dearborn Partners ceases to beneficially own 50% or more of our common stock;\n\u2022\nprovide that special meetings of the stockholders can only be called by (i) the chairman or vice chairman of the Board, (ii) our chief executive officer, (iii) a majority of the Board through a special resolution or (iv) the holders of at least 10% of our common stock until such time as Madison Dearborn Partners ceases to beneficially own 50% or more of our common stock, effected by consent in writing by such stockholders;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to the Board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nprovide that the Board is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our amended and restated by-laws.\nThese anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in our control, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), our certificate of incorporation or our by-laws or (iv) any other action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine may, in each case, be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder\u2019s counsel. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nBecause we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you are able to sell your common stock for a price greater than your purchase price.\nWe do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends on shares of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, including those under the senior credit facility and the indenture governing the 4.625% senior notes, any potential indebtedness we may incur, restrictions imposed by applicable law, tax considerations and other factors the Board deems relevant. Accordingly, if we do not pay dividends in the future, realization of a gain on your investment will depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur.\nWe are required to pay our existing owners for certain tax benefits to the extent realized by us (or deemed realized by us in the case of a change of control, certain divestitures or certain other events), which amounts are expected to be material and, in some instances, may exceed the tax benefits actually realized by us.\nWe have entered into an ITRA with our existing stockholder, VWR Holdings. The ITRA provides for the payment by us to VWR Holdings of 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that we along with our domestic subsidiaries actually realize as a result of the utilization of our pre-IPO net operating loss carryforwards.\nThese payment obligations are our obligations and not obligations of any of our subsidiaries. The actual timing of any payments under the ITRA will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the amount, character and timing of our and our domestic subsidiaries\u2019 taxable income in the future. We expect that the payments we will be required to make under the ITRA will be material.\nAt December 31, 2015, we reported a liability of $163.1 million for the ITRA, which represents 85% of the full amount of applicable recognized loss. Future changes in the realization of our net operating loss carryforwards that were generated prior to our IPO may impact the amount that will ultimately be paid to VWR Holdings, if any. We expect to repay the obligation within the carryforward period of the tax attributes without expiration.\nIn addition, the ITRA provides that upon certain mergers, stock and asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control, the ITRA will terminate and we will be required to make a payment equal to the present value (at a discount rate of LIBOR plus 1.00%) of anticipated future payments under the ITRA. Such payment would be based on certain assumptions, including those relating to our and our domestic subsidiaries\u2019 future taxable income, and may therefore significantly exceed the actual tax benefits we ultimately realize from our net operating losses. We will have a similar obligation to make a present value accelerated payment based on certain assumptions if we dispose of certain subsidiaries or if we breach any of our material obligations under the ITRA, each of which also may result in a payment significantly in excess of the actual tax benefits we ultimately realize from our net operating losses. In these situations, our obligations under the ITRA could have a negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control. Additionally, under the terms of the ITRA, VWR Holdings may be permitted to assign its rights under the agreement without our consent, in which case we may be required to deal with an unrelated counterparty under the agreement.\nVWR Holdings will not reimburse us for any payments previously made under the ITRA if such benefits are subsequently disallowed (although future payments would be adjusted to the extent possible to reflect the result of such disallowance). As a result, in certain circumstances, payments could be made under the ITRA in excess of our ultimate cash tax savings. To the extent that we are unable to make timely payments under the ITRA for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 3.00% per annum until paid. We have agreed under the ITRA not to incur, and not to permit any of our domestic subsidiaries to incur, any new restrictions that would limit our ability to make payments under such agreement or the ability of our domestic subsidiaries to make payments to us for that purpose. This restriction could make it more difficult or costly for us to refinance our outstanding indebtedness. See Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nWe are a holding company and rely on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations.\nWe are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own. As a result, we are largely dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations. The agreements governing the indebtedness of our subsidiaries impose restrictions on our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us. Additionally, deterioration of the earnings from, or other available assets of, our subsidiaries for any reason could also limit or impair their ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us.", "PERMNO": 15023, "SIC": 5040, "TIC": "VWR"}
