Risk Factors\nRISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves a variety of risks. In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report, the following risk factors should be carefully considered, as they could have a significant adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present material risks to our operations. In addition, the global economic and political climate amplifies many of these risks. All forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nA summary of significant risks that could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations include:\nRisks Related to Our Industry:\n\u2022Continuing COVID-19 impacts;\n\u2022Cyclical/seasonal business and dependence upon spending of our customers (which is volatile);\n\u2022Instability of crude oil and natural gas commodity prices;\n\u2022Adverse weather conditions impact demand services and influence costs;\n\u2022Competition and availability of equipment within the oilfield services industry affects use and price of services;\n\u2022The energy services industry\u2019s inherent hazards;\n\u2022Competition among oilfield service and equipment providers, including impact of each provider\u2019s reputation for environmental impact, safety and quality;\n\u2022Oilfield anti-indemnity provisions in many states that restrict or prohibit risk mitigation strategies, such as indemnification;\n\u2022New technologies developed by third parties impacting competitiveness;\n\u2022Laws and regulations regarding health, safety and protection of the environment increasing costs of doing business, penalties, damages or costs of remediation or implicate corrective measures;\n\u2022Legislative and regulatory initiatives prohibiting or impairing hydraulic fracturing operations;\n\u2022Laws and regulations addressing greenhouse gases and climate change; and\n\u2022Changes in transportation regulations increasing costs or administrative burdens.\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\u2022Loss of customers;\n\u2022Detrimental performance by, or credit risk of, our customers;\n\u2022High capital costs of maintenance, upgrades, refurbishment and replacement of assets;\n\u2022Ability to employ a sufficient number of key employees, technical personnel and qualified workers;\n\u2022Overcommitments to certain supply agreement;\n\u2022Delays in deliveries, increases in costs or unavailability of key materials for our operations;\n\u2022Litigation and other proceedings, including claims for personal injury and property damage;\n\u2022Challenges obtaining or renewing permits or authorizations for our or our customers\u2019 operations;\n\u2022Successful identification and consummation of beneficial acquisitions;\n\u2022Time-consuming and costly integration of any acquisitions;\n\u2022Increased labor costs or failure to attract and retain qualified employees;\n\u2022Failure of our information technology systems;\n\u2022Cyber security risks;\n\u2022Failure of internal controls; and\n\u2022Violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-bribery laws.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\n\u2022Our substantial level of indebtedness;\n\u2022Ability to incur additional debt, despite our current indebtedness levels;\n\u2022Restrictive covenants in our agreements governing our indebtedness;\n\u2022Our variable rate debt that is subject to interest rate fluctuations;\n\u2022Restriction on our ability to raise capital on favorable terms, or at all; and\n\u2022Potential reduction or expiration of our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\u2022The price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance;\n\u2022Our shareholders may not be able to resell their shares at or above the public offering price;\n\u2022The market price of our common stock could decline and our stockholders may be diluted if large blocks of stock become available in the market;\n\u2022We do not currently pay dividends;\n\u2022We have no requirement to execute on any capital return program;\n\u2022Stockholders may be diluted by the future issuance of additional common stock;\n\u2022Keane Investor and Cerberus own a significant amount of our common stock and continue to have influence over us;\n\u2022Stockholder actions and/or acquisition of the Company is impacted by restrictive provisions in our charter documents, certain agreements governing our indebtedness, our Stockholders\u2019 Agreement (as defined herein) and Delaware law; and\n\u2022The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders under our formation documents.\nDiscussion of Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced demand for our services and adversely impacted our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, and it is uncertain when its impact on the world will wane. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including actions taken by businesses and governments, resulted in a significant and swift reduction in U.S. and international economic activity beginning in the first quarter of 2020. These effects adversely affected the demand for oil and natural gas, which resulted in a reduction in demand for our services.\nThe pandemic is continuously evolving, and the extent to which our operating and financial results will continue to be affected will depend on various factors beyond our control, such as the ultimate duration, severity and sustained geographic resurgence of the virus; the emergence of new variants and strains of the virus (including Delta and Omicron); and the success of actions to contain the spread of the virus and its variants, or treat its impact, such as the availability and acceptance of vaccines and treatments.\nWe are closely monitoring the effects of the pandemic on commodity demands, our customers, our suppliers, and on our operations and employees. These effects have included, and may continue to include, adverse revenue effects; supply chain disruptions; inflationary impacts on cost of goods and services sold, customer shutdowns of oil and gas exploration and production; employee impacts from illness, school closures and other community response measures; and temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers and suppliers.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from it, could also exacerbate other risk factors that we identify in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may also continue to see an increase in the volume of litigation, including contract claims (some of which may result from force majeure claims) and employment related claims.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition in a manner that is not currently known to us or that we do not currently believe presents significant risks to our operations.\nOur business is cyclical and depends on spending and well completions by the onshore oil and natural gas industry predominately in the United States, and the level of such activity is volatile. Our business has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by industry and financial market conditions that are beyond our control.\nOur business is cyclical, and we depend on the willingness of our customers to make expenditures to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas from predominantly U.S. onshore unconventional resources. The willingness of our customers to undertake these activities depends largely upon prevailing industry and financial market conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including:\n\u2022the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022prices and expectations about future prices for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022domestic and foreign supply of, and demand for, oil and natural gas and related products;\n\u2022the level of global and domestic oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022the supply of and demand for hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield services and equipment in the U.S. and the areas in which we operate;\n\u2022the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u2022the availability of adequate pipeline, storage and other transportation capacity;\n\u2022lead times associated with acquiring equipment and products and availability of qualified personnel;\n\u2022the rates at which new oil and natural gas reserves are discovered;\n\u2022federal, state and local regulation of hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield service activities, such as water disposal, as well as exploration and production activities, including public pressure on governmental bodies and regulatory agencies to regulate our industry;\n\u2022the availability of water resources, suitable proppant and chemicals in sufficient quantities for use in hydraulic fracturing fluids;\n\u2022geopolitical developments, political instability and recent (and potential future) armed hostilities in oil and natural gas producing countries;\n\u2022actions of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, its members and other state-controlled oil companies (\u201cOPEC+\u201d) relating to oil price and production controls;\n\u2022advances in exploration, development and production technologies or in technologies affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022the price and availability of alternative fuels and energy sources;\n\u2022disruptions due to natural disasters, unexpected or extreme weather conditions, public health crises (such as coronavirus) and similar factors;\n\u2022merger and divestiture activity amongst oil and natural gas producers;\n\u2022uncertainty in capital and commodities markets and the ability of oil and natural gas producers and oil and natural gas midstream operators to raise equity capital and debt financing;\n\u2022investor and public sentiment related to corporate social responsibility and sustainability; and\n\u2022U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. governmental regulations and taxes.\nAs we have experienced since late March of 2020, the volatility of the oil and natural gas industry and the resulting impact on exploration and production activity could adversely impact the level of drilling and completion activity by some of our customers. This volatility may result in a decline in the demand for our services or adversely affect the price of our services. In addition, material declines in oil and natural gas prices, or drilling or completion activity in the U.S. oil and natural gas shale regions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, a decrease in the development of oil and natural gas reserves in the U.S. may also have an adverse impact on our business, even in an environment of strong oil and natural gas prices.\nA decline in or substantial volatility of crude oil and natural gas commodity prices could adversely affect the demand for our services.\nThe demand for our services is substantially influenced by current and anticipated crude oil and natural gas commodity prices, the related level of drilling and completion activity and general production spending in the areas in which we have operations. Volatility or weakness in crude oil and natural gas commodity prices (or the perception that crude oil and natural gas commodity prices will decrease) affects the operational and capital spending patterns of our customers, and the products and services we provide are, to a substantial extent, deferrable in the event oil and natural gas companies reduce capital expenditures. During periods of declining oil and natural gas prices or when pricing remains depressed, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, our customer base may experience significant declines in drilling, completion and production activities, which in turn may result in reduced utilization and increased competition and pricing pressure to varying degrees across our service lines and operating areas.\nHistorically, prices for crude oil and natural gas have been extremely volatile, and these prices are expected to experience continued volatility. For example, since 2016, crude oil prices have ranged from a low of ($36.98) in 2020 to a high of $85.64 per barrel in 2021. During 2021, NYMEX crude oil prices ranged from approximately $47.47 to $85.64 per barrel, with natural gas prices ranging from $2.43 per million British thermal units (\u201cMMbtu\u201d) to $23.86 per MMbtu. Continued price volatility for oil and natural gas is expected during 2022.\nWorldwide military, political and economic events, including initiatives by OPEC+, affect both the demand for, and the supply of, oil and natural gas. Weather conditions, governmental regulation (both in the United States and elsewhere), levels of consumer demand, commercial development of economically viable alternative energy sources (such as wind, solar, geothermal, tidal, fuel cells and biofuels), fuel conservation measures, the availability of pipeline capacity and other factors that will be beyond our control may also affect the supply of, demand for, and price of oil and natural gas. This, in turn, could result in lower demand for our services and cause lower pricing and utilization levels for our services.\nAdverse weather conditions could impact demand for our services or materially impact our costs.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by adverse weather conditions. Our operations and the operations of our customers may be adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions, severe weather events and natural disasters. For example, periods of drought, hurricanes, tropical storms, heavy snow, ice or rain may result in customer delays and other disruptions to our services, including availability of key products such as sand and water. Repercussions of adverse weather conditions may include:\n\u2022curtailment of services;\n\u2022weather-related damage to facilities and equipment, resulting in delays in operations;\n\u2022inability to deliver equipment, personnel and products to job sites in accordance with contract schedules;\n\u2022increase in the price of key products or insurance; and\n\u2022loss of productivity.\nCompetition and availability of excess equipment within the oilfield services industry may adversely affect our ability to market and price our services.\nThe oilfield services industry is highly competitive. The principal competitive tactics in our markets are generally price, technical expertise, the availability and condition of equipment, work force capability, safety record, reputation and experience. Furthermore, as a result of this competition, available equipment in the markets in which one or more of our product lines competes at times may exceed the demand for such equipment. This excess supply of equipment may result from many factors, including without limitation, a low commodity price environment, increase in the construction of new equipment, or reactivation and improvement of existing equipment. Excess capacity may result in substantial competition for a diminishing amount of demand and/or significant price competition, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nThe oilfield services industry is highly fragmented and includes several large companies that compete in many of the markets we serve, as well as numerous small companies that compete with us on a local basis. Some of our competitors may have greater resources and/or name recognition, which could allow them to better withstand industry downturns and to compete more effectively on the basis of technology, geographic scope, retained skilled personnel and economies of scale. In addition, our industry has experienced recent consolidation through mergers and acquisitions, which could lead to increased resources and capabilities for our competitors. There may also be new companies that enter our business, or re-enter our business with significantly reduced indebtedness following emergence from bankruptcy, or our existing and potential future customers may develop their own oilfield solutions. Our operations may be adversely affected if our current competitors or new market entrants introduce new products, technology or services with better features, performance, prices or other characteristics than our products and services or expand in service areas where we operate.\nWe periodically seek to increase prices of our services to offset rising costs and to generate higher returns for our stockholders. Because we operate in a very competitive industry, however, we are not always successful in raising or maintaining our existing prices. Even if we are able to increase our prices, we may not be able to do so at a\nrate that is sufficient to offset rising costs without adversely affecting our activity levels. The inability to maintain our pricing and to increase our pricing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. In addition, we may be unable to replace dedicated contracts that were terminated early, extend expiring contracts or obtain new contracts in the spot market, and the rates and other material terms under any new or extended contracts may be on substantially less favorable rates and terms.\nAccordingly, high competition and excess equipment in the market can cause us to have difficulty maintaining pricing, utilization and profit margins and, at times, result in operating losses. We cannot predict the future level of competition or excess equipment in the oil and natural gas service businesses or the level of demand for our services.\nOur operations are subject to hazards inherent in the energy services industry.\nRisks inherent to our industry can cause personal injury, loss of life, suspension of or impact upon operations, damage to geological formations, damage to facilities, business interruption and damage to, or destruction of, property, equipment and the environment. Such risks may include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022equipment defects;\n\u2022vehicle accidents;\n\u2022fires, explosions or uncontrollable flows of gas or well fluids;\n\u2022unusual or unexpected geological formations or pressures and industrial accidents;\n\u2022blowouts;\n\u2022cratering;\n\u2022loss of well control;\n\u2022collapse of the borehole; and\n\u2022damaged or lost drilling and well completions equipment.\nCatastrophic or significantly adverse events can occur at well sites where we conduct our operations, including explosions, fires, personal injuries, property damage, pollution, clean-up responsibility and regulatory responsibility. In response, we typically seek indemnities, releases and limitations on liability in our contracts with our customers, together with liability insurance coverage, to protect us from potential liability related to such occurrences. However, it is possible that customers or insurers could seek to avoid such provisions (or compliance with such provisions) or be financially unable to meet their obligations, or a court may decline to enforce such provisions. Damages that are not indemnified or released could greatly exceed available insurance coverage and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nCatastrophic or significantly adverse events can also occur at our facilities and during transport of our equipment, commodities, and personnel to well sites. Our safety procedures may not always prevent such damages. Our insurance coverage or coverage of applicable vendors and service providers may be inadequate to cover our liabilities. In addition, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable and commercially justifiable or on terms as favorable as our current arrangements. The occurrence of a significant uninsured claim, a claim in excess of the insurance coverage limits maintained by us or a claim at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct normal business operations and on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn addition, our services could become a source of spills or releases of fluids, including chemicals used during activities, at the site where such services are performed, or could result in the discharge of such fluids into underground formations that were not targeted for fracturing or activities, such as potable aquifers. These risks could\nexpose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, loss of oil and natural gas production, pollution and other environmental damages and could result in a variety of claims, losses and remedial obligations that could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The existence, frequency and severity of such incidents could affect operating costs, insurability, reputation and relationships with customers, employees and regulators. Any litigation or claims, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively affect our reputation with our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future.\nCompetition among oilfield service and equipment providers is affected by each provider\u2019s reputation for environmental impact, safety and quality.\nOur activities are subject to a wide range of national, state and local environmental, occupational health and safety laws and regulations. In addition, customers maintain their own compliance and reporting requirements. Failure to comply with these environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, or failure to comply with our customers\u2019 compliance or reporting requirements, could tarnish our reputation for safety and quality and have a material adverse effect on our competitive position. In particular, our customers may elect not to purchase our services if they view our environmental or safety record as unsatisfactory, which could cause us to lose customers and substantial revenue.\nOilfield anti-indemnity provisions enacted by many states may restrict or prohibit a party\u2019s indemnification of us.\nWe typically enter into agreements with our customers governing the provision of our services, which usually include certain indemnification provisions for losses resulting from operations. Such agreements may require each party to indemnify the other against certain claims regardless of the negligence or other fault of the indemnified party; however, many states place limitations on contractual indemnity agreements, particularly agreements that indemnify a party against the consequences of its own negligence. Furthermore, certain states, including Louisiana, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming, have enacted statutes generally referred to as \u201coilfield anti-indemnity acts\u201d expressly prohibiting certain indemnity agreements contained in or related to oilfield services agreements. Such oilfield anti-indemnity acts, whether enacted/amended in the future or currently in existence, may restrict or void a party\u2019s indemnification of us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nNew technology may cause us to become less competitive.\nThe oilfield services industry is subject to the introduction of new drilling and completion techniques and services using new technologies, some of which may be subject to patent or other intellectual property protections. As competitors and others use or develop new or comparable technologies in the future, we may lose market share or be placed at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, technological changes, process improvements and other factors that increase operational efficiencies could continue to result in oil and natural gas wells being completed more quickly, which could reduce the number of revenue earning days. Furthermore, we may face competitive pressure to develop, implement or acquire certain new technologies at a substantial cost. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that may allow them to enjoy technological advantages and develop and implement new products on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. We cannot be certain that we will be able to develop and implement new technologies or products on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. Limits on our ability to develop, acquire, effectively use and implement new and emerging technologies may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations. Further, some of our competitors and suppliers have a substantial amount of intellectual property related to new technologies. We cannot guarantee that our processes and products do not and will not infringe issued patents (whether present or future) or other intellectual property rights belonging to others, including, without limitation, situations in which our products, processes or technologies may be covered by patent applications filed by other parties in the U.S. or abroad.\nExisting or future laws and regulations and indirect consequences related to greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business and may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to the release, capture and use of carbon dioxide that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, prospects and financial condition.\nChanges in environmental requirements related to greenhouse gases and climate change may negatively impact demand for our services. For example, oil and natural gas exploration and production may decline as a result of environmental requirements, including land use policies responsive to environmental concerns. Federal, state and local agencies have been evaluating climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business. Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws and regulations related to emissions of greenhouse gases and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws or regulations reduce demand for oil and natural gas. Likewise, such restrictions may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to the release, capture, sequestration and use of carbon dioxide that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, prospects and financial condition.\nAdditionally, increasing political and social attention to global climate change has resulted in pressure upon stockholders, financial institutions and/or financial markets to modify their relationships with oil and gas companies and to limit investments and/or funding to such companies, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding issues of health, safety and protection of the environment. Under these laws and regulations, we may become liable for penalties, damages or costs of remediation or other corrective measures. Any changes in laws or government regulations could increase our costs of doing business.\nOur operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and tribal laws and regulations relating to, among other things, protection of natural resources, clean air and drinking water, wetlands, endangered species, greenhouse gasses, areas that are not in attainment with air quality standards, the environment, health and safety, chemical use and storage, waste management, waste disposal and transportation of waste and other hazardous and nonhazardous materials. Our operations involve risks of environmental liability, including leakage from an operator\u2019s casing during our operations or accidental spills onto or into surface or subsurface soils, surface water or groundwater. Some environmental laws and regulations may impose strict liability, joint and several liability or both. In some situations, we could be exposed to liability as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, third parties without regard to whether we caused or contributed to the conditions. Additionally, environmental concerns, including potential emissions affecting clean air, including methane, drinking water contamination and seismic activity, have prompted investigations that could lead to the enactment of regulations, limitations, restrictions or moratoria that could potentially have a material adverse impact on our business. Actions arising under these laws and regulations could result in the shutdown of our operations, fines and penalties (administrative, civil or criminal), revocations of or restrictions in permits to conduct business, expenditures for remediation or other corrective measures and/or claims for liability for property damage, exposure to hazardous materials, exposure to hazardous waste, nuisance or personal injuries. Sanctions for noncompliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may also include the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, revocation of or restrictions in permits and temporary or permanent cessation of operations in a particular location and issuance of corrective action orders. Such claims or sanctions and related costs could cause us to incur substantial costs or losses and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations. Additionally, an increase in regulatory requirements, limitations, restrictions or moratoria on oil and natural gas exploration and completion activities at a federal, state or local level could significantly delay or interrupt our operations, limit the amount of work we can perform, increase our costs of compliance, or increase the cost of our services; thereby possibly having a material adverse impact on our financial condition. Given the recent administration change in the United States, we expect that the regulations around the oil and gas industry may increase and/or become stricter, which may further any potential material adverse impact on our financial condition. For example, the EPA\u2019s recently proposed changes to the standards of performance and emissions guidelines for new, reconstructed, and modified sources in the oil and natural gas sector could require additional monitoring, upgraded control equipment, and/or modified operations at current oil and natural gas operations.\nIf we do not perform in accordance with government, industry, customer or our own health, safety and environmental standards (including standards put in place related to the COVID-19 pandemic), we could lose business from our customers, many of whom have an increased focus on environmental, health and safety issues.\nWe are subject to requirements imposed by the EPA, U.S. Department of Transportation, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, OSHA and state regulatory agencies that regulate operations to prevent air, soil and water pollution, and protect worker health and safety.\nThe EPA regulates air emissions from all engines, including off-road diesel engines that are used by us to power equipment in the field. Under these U.S. emission control regulations, we could be limited in the number of certain off-road diesel engines we can purchase. Further, the requirement to comply with emission control and fuel quality regulations could result in increased costs.\nIn addition, as part of our business, we handle, transport, and dispose of a variety of fluids and substances used by our customers in connection with their oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. We also generate and dispose of nonhazardous and hazardous wastes. The generation, handling, transportation, and disposal of these fluids, substances, and wastes are regulated by a number of laws, including CERCLA, RCRA, the Clean Water Act, the SDWA and analogous state laws. Under RCRA, the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes are regulated. RCRA currently exempts many oil and gas exploration and production wastes from classification as hazardous waste. However, these oil and gas exploration and production wastes may still be regulated under state solid waste laws and regulations, and it is possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous waste in the future.\nFailure to properly handle, transport or dispose of these materials or otherwise conduct our operations in accordance with these and other environmental laws could expose us to liability for governmental penalties, third-party claims, cleanup costs associated with releases of such materials, damages to natural resources, and other damages, as well as potentially impair our ability to conduct our operations. Moreover, certain of these environmental laws impose joint and several, strict liability even though our conduct in performing such activities was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third-parties was the basis for such liability. In addition, environmental laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and if existing laws, regulatory requirements or enforcement policies were to change in the future, we may be required to make significant unanticipated capital and operating expenditures.\nLaws and regulations protecting the environment generally have become more stringent over time, and we expect them to continue to do so. This could lead to material increases in our costs, and liability exposure, for future environmental compliance and remediation.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could prohibit, restrict or limit hydraulic fracturing operations, could increase our operating costs or could result in the disclosure of proprietary information resulting in competitive harm.\nDuring recent sessions of the U.S. Congress, several pieces of legislation were introduced in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives for the purpose of amending environmental laws such as the Clean Air Act, the SDWA and the Toxic Substances Control Act with respect to activities associated with extraction and energy production industries, especially the oil and gas industry. Furthermore, various items of legislation and rulemaking have been proposed that would regulate or prevent federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing on federally owned land. Proposed rulemaking from the EPA and OSHA could increase our regulatory requirements, which could increase our costs of compliance or increase the costs of our services, thereby possibly having a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nIf the EPA, DOI, or another federal or state agency asserts jurisdiction over certain aspects of hydraulic fracturing operations, an additional level of regulation established at the federal or state level could lead to operational delays and increase our costs. In December 2016, the EPA issued a study of the potential impacts of\nhydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater. The EPA report states that there is scientific evidence that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking resources under some circumstances, and identifies certain conditions in which the EPA believes the impact of such activities on drinking water and groundwater can be more frequent or severe. The EPA study could spur further initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or otherwise. Many regulatory and legislative bodies routinely evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of laws and regulations affecting the oil and gas industry. As a result, state legislatures, state regulatory agencies and local municipalities may consider legislation, regulations or ordinances, respectively, that could affect all aspects of the oil and natural gas industry and occasionally take action to restrict or further regulate hydraulic fracturing operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business of these state and municipal actions or the enactment of additional federal or state legislation or regulations affecting hydraulic fracturing. Compliance, stricter regulations or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nMany states in which we operate require the disclosure of some or all of the chemicals used in our hydraulic fracturing operations. Certain aspects of one or more of these chemicals may be considered proprietary by us or our chemical suppliers. Disclosure of our proprietary chemical information to third parties or to the public, even if inadvertent, could diminish the value of our trade secrets or those of our chemical suppliers and could result in competitive harm to us, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nWe are also aware that some states, counties and municipalities have enacted or are considering moratoria on hydraulic fracturing. For example, New York and Vermont, states in which we have no operations, have banned or are in the process of banning the use of high-volume hydraulic fracturing. Alternatively, some municipalities are considering or have considered zoning and other ordinances, the conditions of which could impose a de facto ban on drilling and/or hydraulic fracturing operations. Further, some states, counties and municipalities are closely examining water use issues, such as permit and disposal options for processed water, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, prospects and results of operations, if such additional permitting requirements are imposed upon our industry. Additionally, our business could be affected by a moratorium or increased regulation of companies in our supply chain, such as sand mining by our proppant suppliers, which could limit our access to supplies and increase the costs of our raw materials. At this time, it is not possible to estimate how these various restrictions could affect our ongoing operations.\nChanges in transportation regulations may increase our costs and negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe are subject to various transportation regulations, including regulation of motor carriers by the U.S. Department of Transportation and by various federal, state and tribal agencies, whose regulations include certain permit requirements imposed by highway and safety authorities. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers over our trucking operations, generally governing such matters as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, safety, equipment testing, driver requirements and specifications and insurance requirements. The trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may impact our operations, such as changes in fuel emissions limits, hours of service regulations that govern the amount of time a driver may drive or work in any specific period and limits on vehicle weight and size. As the federal government continues to develop and propose regulations relating to fuel quality, engine efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions, we may experience an increase in costs related to truck purchases and maintenance, impairment of equipment productivity, a decrease in the residual value of vehicles, unpredictable fluctuations in fuel prices and an increase in operating expenses. Increased truck traffic may contribute to deteriorating road conditions in some areas where our operations are performed. Our operations, including routing and weight restrictions, could be affected by road construction, road repairs, detours and state and local regulations and ordinances restricting access to certain roads. Proposals to increase federal, state or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, are also made from time to time, and any such increase would increase our operating costs. Also, state and local regulation of permitted routes and times on specific roadways could adversely affect our operations. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any legislative or regulatory changes or municipal ordinances applicable to our logistics operations will be enacted and to what\nextent any such legislation or regulations could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe loss of one or more significant customers could adversely affect our financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nOur business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations could be materially adversely affected, if one or more of our significant customers ceases to engage us for our services on favorable terms or at all, or fails to pay or delays in paying us significant amounts of our outstanding receivables. Our completions business has historically had contracts with a limited number of our customers that are annual to multi-year.\nDisruption caused by continued business and governmental responses to the COVID-19 pandemic has created increased vulnerability to loss of customers or loss of long-term contracts as demand for oilfield services has decreased and competition for the available jobs has increased. We may be unable to replace dedicated contracts that were terminated early, extend expiring contracts or obtain new contracts in the spot market, and the rates and other material terms under any new or extended contracts may be on substantially less favorable rates and terms.\nAdditionally, the E&P industry is characterized by frequent consolidation activity. Changes in ownership of our customers may result in the loss of, or reduction in, business from those customers, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our customers, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers, many of whose operations are concentrated solely in the domestic E&P industry which, as described above, is subject to volatility and, therefore, credit risk. Our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully reduce customer credit risk. If we are unable to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers or unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness, any resulting increase in nonpayment or nonperformance by them and our inability to re-market or otherwise use our equipment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nOur assets require significant amounts of capital for maintenance, upgrades and refurbishment and may require significant capital expenditures for new equipment.\nOur hydraulic fracturing fleets and other service-related equipment require significant capital investment in maintenance, upgrades and refurbishment to maintain their competitiveness. Our fleets and other equipment typically do not generate revenue while they are undergoing maintenance, refurbishment or upgrades. Any maintenance, upgrade or refurbishment project for our assets could increase our indebtedness or reduce cash available for other opportunities. Furthermore, such projects may require proportionally greater capital investments as a percentage of total asset value, which may make such projects difficult to finance on acceptable terms. To the extent we are unable to fund such projects, we may have less equipment available for service, or our equipment may not be attractive to potential or current customers. Additionally, increased demand, competition, environmental and safety requirements or advances in technology within our industry may require us to update or replace existing fleets or build or acquire new fleets. Such demands on our capital or reductions in demand for our hydraulic fracturing fleets and other service-related equipment and the increase in cost to maintain labor necessary for such maintenance and improvement, in each case, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to employ a sufficient number of key employees, technical personnel and other skilled or qualified workers.\nThe delivery of our services and products requires personnel with specialized skills and experience who can perform physically demanding work. As a result of the volatility in the energy service industry and the demanding nature of the work, workers may choose to pursue employment with our competitors or in fields that offer a less demanding work environment. In addition, since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may not have sufficient employees who are able to work at job sites, due to illness, school closures and other community response measures; and temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers and suppliers, or health and safety protocols.\nFurthermore, we require full compliance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and other laws concerning immigration and the hiring of legally documented workers. We recognize that foreign nationals may be a valuable source of talent, but that not all foreign nationals are authorized to work for U.S. companies immediately, without first obtaining a required work authorization from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security or similar government agency. Our ability to be productive and profitable will depend upon our ability to employ and retain skilled workers. In addition, our ability to adjust our operations according to geographic demand for our services depends in part on our ability to relocate or increase the size of our skilled labor force. The demand for skilled workers in our areas of operations can be high, the supply may be limited, and we may be unable to relocate our employees from areas of lower utilization to areas of higher demand. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force, increases in the wage rates that we must pay, or both. Furthermore, a significant decrease in the wages paid by us or our competitors as a result of reduced industry demand could result in a reduction of the available skilled labor force, and there is no assurance that the availability of skilled labor will improve following a subsequent increase in demand for our services or an increase in wage rates. If any of these events were to occur, our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired.\nWe depend heavily on the efforts of executive officers, managers and other key employees to manage our operations. The unexpected loss or unavailability of key members of management or technical personnel (including due to illness related to COVID-19) may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations.\nOur commitments under supply agreements could exceed our requirements, exposing us to risks including price, timing of delivery and quality of products and services upon which our business relies.\nWe have purchase commitments with certain vendors to supply a majority of the proppant that we may provide in our operations. Some of these agreements are take-or-pay agreements with minimum purchase obligations. If demand for our hydraulic fracturing services decreases, our need for the raw materials and products we supply as part of these services also decreases. If demand decreases enough, we could have contractual minimum commitments that exceed the required amount of goods we need to supply to our customers. In this instance, we could be required to purchase goods that we do not have a present need for, pay for goods that we do not take delivery of or pay prices in excess of market prices at the time of purchase. We may not be able to reduce, extend, eliminate or otherwise address near-term obligations to our satisfaction, which could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nDelays in deliveries of key raw materials or increases in the cost of key raw materials could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have established relationships with a limited number of suppliers of our raw materials (such as proppant, chemicals, cement, steel, or coiled tubing) and finished products (such as fluid-handling equipment). Raw materials essential to our business are normally readily available. However, high levels of demand for raw materials, such as proppant and hydrochloric acid, as well as oil and natural gas based derivatives, have triggered constraints in the supply chain of those raw materials and could dramatically increase the prices of such raw materials. Should any of our current suppliers be unable to provide the necessary raw materials or finished products or otherwise fail to deliver the products in a timely manner and in the quantities required, any resulting delays in the provision of services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, increasing costs of certain raw materials, including proppant, may negatively impact demand\nfor our services or the profitability of our business operations. In the past, our industry faced sporadic shortages associated with hydraulic fracturing operations, such as proppant and other raw materials, requiring work stoppages, which adversely impacted the operating results of several competitors. We may not be able to mitigate any future shortages of raw materials, including proppants.\nWe may be subject to litigation and other proceedings, including claims for personal injury and property damage, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nOur services are subject to inherent risks that can cause personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment or the environment or the suspension of our operations. Our operations are subject to, and exposed to, employee/employer liabilities and risks such as wrongful termination, discrimination, labor organizing, retaliation claims and general human resource related matters. Litigation arising from operations where our facilities are located, or our services are provided, may cause us to be named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting potentially large claims including claims for exemplary damages. Additionally, because our business is related to fossil fuel production, there is an increasing risk that we may be subject to generalized lawsuits which attempt to hold companies in the fossil fuel industry liable for alleged local impacts of climate change. Such legal theories are still developing, making it difficult to assess the likelihood or scope of potential liabilities. We maintain what we believe is customary and reasonable insurance to protect our business against these potential losses, but such insurance may not be adequate to cover our liabilities, and we are not fully insured against all risks, including losses related to alleged climate claim damages. Further, our insurance has deductibles or self-insured retentions and contains certain coverage exclusions. The current trend in the insurance industry is towards larger deductibles and self-insured retentions. In addition, insurance may not be available in the future at rates that we consider reasonable and commercially justifiable, compelling us to have larger deductibles or self-insured retentions to effectively manage expenses. As a result, we could become subject to material uninsured liabilities or situations where we have high deductibles or self-insured retentions that expose us to liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations.\nLitigation and other proceedings could have a negative impact on our business.\nThe nature of our business makes us susceptible to legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations from time to time. In addition, during periods of depressed market conditions, we may be subject to an increased risk of our customers, vendors, current and former employees and others initiating legal proceedings against us that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, any legal proceedings or claims, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future. See Note (18) Commitments and Contingencies of Part II, \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion of our legal and environmental contingencies for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nDelays in obtaining, or inability to obtain or renew, permits or authorizations by our customers for their operations or by us for our operations could impair our business.\nIn most states, our customers are required to obtain permits or authorizations from one or more governmental agencies or other third parties to perform drilling and completion activities, including hydraulic fracturing. Such permits or approvals are typically required by state agencies, but can also be required by federal and local governmental agencies or other third parties. The requirements for such permits or authorizations vary depending on the location where such drilling and completion activities will be conducted. As with most permitting and authorization processes, there is a degree of uncertainty as to whether a permit will be granted, the time it will take for a permit or approval to be issued and the conditions which may be imposed in connection with the granting of the permit. In some jurisdictions, such as within the jurisdiction of the Delaware River Basin Commission, certain regulatory authorities have delayed or suspended the issuance of permits or authorizations, while the potential environmental impacts associated with issuing such permits can be studied and appropriate mitigation measures evaluated. New York and Vermont, states in which we have no operations, have prohibited hydraulic fracturing statewide. In Texas, rural water districts have begun to impose restrictions on water use and may require permits for water used in drilling and completion activities. Permitting, authorization or renewal delays, the inability to obtain new permits or the revocation of current permits could cause a loss of revenue and potentially have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations.\nWe are also required to obtain federal, state, local and/or third-party permits and authorizations in some jurisdictions in connection with our wireline services. These permits, when required, impose certain conditions on our operations. Any changes in these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in identifying and making acquisitions.\nPart of our strategy is to continue to expand our scope and customer relationships, increase our access to technology and to grow our business, which is dependent on our ability to make acquisitions that result in accretive revenues and earnings. We may be unable to make accretive acquisitions or realize expected benefits of any acquisitions for any of the following reasons:\n\u2022 failure to identify attractive targets;\n\u2022 incorrect assumptions regarding the future liabilities or future results of acquired operations or assets or expected cost reductions or other synergies expected to be realized as a result of acquiring operations or assets;\n\u2022 failure to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all;\n\u2022 restrictions in our debt agreements;\n\u2022 failure to successfully integrate the operations or management of any acquired operations or assets;\n\u2022 failure to retain or attract key employees;\n\u2022 new or expanded areas of operational risk (such as offshore, international operations, or power production services) and related costs and demands of any applicable regulatory compliance; and\n\u2022 diversion of management\u2019s attention from existing operations or other priorities.\nOur acquisition strategy requires that we successfully integrate acquired companies into our business practices, as well as our procurement, management and enterprise-wide information technology systems. We may not be successful in implementing our business practices at acquired companies, and our acquisitions could face difficulty in transitioning from their previous information technology systems to our own. Furthermore, unexpected costs and challenges may arise whenever businesses with different operations or management are combined. Any such difficulties, or increased costs associated with such integration, could affect our business, financial performance and operations.\nIf we are unable to identify, complete and integrate acquisitions, it could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nIntegrating acquisitions may be time-consuming and create costs that could reduce our net income and cash flows.\nPart of our strategy includes pursuing acquisitions that we believe will be accretive to our business. If we consummate an acquisition, such as the Alamo Acquisition in 2021 and the C&J Merger in 2019, the process of integrating the acquired business may be complex and time consuming, may be disruptive to the business and may cause an interruption of, or a distraction of management\u2019s attention from, the business as a result of a number of obstacles, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022a failure of our due diligence process to identify significant risks or issues;\n\u2022the loss of customers of the acquired company or our company;\n\u2022customers or suppliers may seek to modify contractual obligations with us;\n\u2022negative impact on the brands or banners of the acquired company or our company;\n\u2022a failure to maintain or improve the quality of our customer service;\n\u2022difficulties assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired company;\n\u2022our inability to retain key personnel of the acquired company;\n\u2022the incurrence of unexpected expenses and working capital requirements;\n\u2022our inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals, including synergies, for the combined businesses;\n\u2022difficulty in maintaining internal controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022mistaken assumptions about the overall costs of equity or debt; and\n\u2022unforeseen difficulties operating in new product areas or new geographic areas.\nAny of the foregoing obstacles, or a combination of them, could decrease gross profit margins or increase selling, general and administrative expenses in absolute terms and/or as a percentage of net sales, which could in turn negatively impact our net income and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to consummate acquisitions in the future on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, future acquisitions are accompanied by the risk that the obligations and liabilities of an acquired company may not be adequately reflected in the historical financial statements of that company and the risk that those historical financial statements may be based on assumptions which are incorrect or inconsistent with our assumptions or approach to accounting policies. Any of these material obligations, liabilities or incorrect or inconsistent assumptions could adversely impact our results of operations, prospects and financial condition.\nIf labor costs increase or we fail to attract and retain qualified employees our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nThe labor markets in the industries in which we operate are competitive. We must attract, train and retain a large number of qualified employees while controlling related labor costs. We face significant competition for these employees from the industries in which we operate as well as from other industries. Tighter labor markets may make it even more difficult for us to hire and retain qualified employees and control labor costs. Our ability to attract qualified employees and control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates, employee preferences, employment law and regulation, environmental, health and safety regulation, labor relations\nand immigration policy. A significant increase in competition or cost increase arising from any of the aforementioned factors in may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA failure of our information technology systems, including our enterprise resource planning system and our digital hub, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and could adversely affect the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe rely on sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure to support our business. Any of these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, usage errors by employees, computer viruses, cyber-attacks or other security breaches or similar events. A failure or prolonged interruption in our information technology systems, including our digital logistics platform, or difficulties encountered in upgrading our systems or implementing new systems that compromises our ability to meet our customers\u2019 needs or impairs our ability to record, process and report accurate information, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks. A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nThe oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain processing activities. We use these technologies for internal purposes, including data storage (which may include personal identification information of our employees as well as our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers, investors and other stakeholders), processing, and transmissions, as well as in our interactions with customers and suppliers. For example, we depend on digital technologies to perform many of our services and processes and to record operational and financial data. At the same time, cyber incidents, which could include, among other things, deliberate attacks, unintentional events, computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, ransomware, social engineering attacks (including phishing and impersonation), hacking, denial-of-service attacks and other attacks and similar disruptions from the unauthorized use of or access to computer systems, have increased. The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats. Our technologies, systems and networks, as well as those of our customers, suppliers and other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary information, personal information and other data, or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as unauthorized surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period of time. Our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks, including cyberattacks, may not be sufficient and may not protect against or cover all of the losses we may experience as a result of the realization of such risks. In addition, these risks could harm our reputation and our relationships with customers, suppliers, employees, and other third-parties, and may result in claims against us, including liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information. As cyber incidents continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate the effects of cyber incidents.\nDisruption caused by business responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, including working remote arrangements, may create increased vulnerability to cybersecurity incidents, including breaches of information systems security, which could damage our reputation and commercial relationships, disrupt operations, increase costs and/or decrease revenues, and expose us to claims from customers, suppliers, financial institutions, regulators, employees and others, which, individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud, which could adversely affect our business and result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide timely and reliable financial reports, prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a publicly traded company. Our efforts to maintain our internal controls may not\nbe successful, and we may be unable to maintain effective controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or to comply with our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSection 404\u201d). For example, Section 404 requires us, among other things, to annually review and report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any deficiencies or material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to develop, implement or maintain effective internal controls or to improve our internal controls could harm our operating results, prevent us from identifying future deficiencies and material weaknesses or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Given the difficulties inherent in the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting, we can provide no assurance as to our, or our independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s conclusions, about the effectiveness of our internal controls, and we may incur significant costs in our efforts to comply with Section 404. Ineffective internal controls could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny and a loss of confidence in our reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-bribery laws.\nThe United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries and partners from making, offering or authorizing improper payments to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Although we currently have limited international operations, we may do business in the future in countries or regions where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our employees, intermediaries, and partners may face, directly or indirectly, corrupt demands by government officials, political parties and officials, tribal or insurgent organizations, or private entities in the countries in which we operate or may operate in the future. As a result, we face the risk that an unauthorized payment or offer of payment could be made by one of our employees, intermediaries, or partners even if such parties are not always subject to our control or are not themselves subject to the FCPA or other anti-bribery laws to which we may be subject. We are committed to doing business in accordance with applicable anti-bribery laws and have implemented policies and procedures concerning compliance with such laws. Our existing safeguards and any future improvements, however, may prove to be less than effective, and our employees, intermediaries, and partners may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws (either due to our acts, the acts of our intermediaries or partners, or our inadvertence) may result in criminal and civil sanctions and could subject us to other liabilities in the U.S. and elsewhere. Even allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, we had $374.9 million of debt outstanding, net of discounts and deferred financing costs (not including finance lease obligations). After giving effect to our borrowing base, we had approximately $205.6 million of availability under our 2019 ABL Facility (as defined herein).\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022adversely affect the market price of our common stock;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to interest rate increases and general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, debt service requirements and other general corporate requirements; and\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nIn addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt, or that we will be able to refinance our debt on commercially reasonable terms. If we were unable to make payments or refinance our debt or obtain new financing under these circumstances, we would have to consider other options, such as:\n\u2022sales of assets;\n\u2022sales of equity; or\n\u2022negotiations with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt.\nOur debt instruments may restrict, or market or business conditions may limit, our ability to use some of our options.\nDespite our indebtedness levels, we may still be able to incur additional debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our leverage.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of the credit agreements that govern the 2019 ABL Facility and the 2018 Term Loan Facility (as defined herein and, together with the 2019 ABL Facility, the \u201cSenior Secured Debt Facilities\u201d) permit us to incur additional indebtedness, subject to certain limitations. If new indebtedness is added to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 current debt levels, the related risks that we and they now face would intensify. See Part II, \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Principal Debt Agreements\u201d for further details.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain operating covenants and restrictions that limit our operations and could lead to adverse consequences if we fail to comply with them.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain operating covenants and other restrictions relating to, among other things, limitations on indebtedness (including guarantees of additional indebtedness) and liens, mergers, consolidations and dissolutions, sales of assets, investments and acquisitions, dividends and other restricted payments, repurchase of shares of capital stock and options to purchase shares of capital stock and certain transactions with affiliates. In addition, our Senior Secured Debt Facilities include certain financial covenants.\nThe restrictions in the agreements governing our indebtedness may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility.\nFailure to comply with these financial and operating covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, declines in the pricing of our services and products, difficulties in implementing cost reduction initiatives, difficulties in implementing our overall business strategy or changes in general economic conditions, which may be beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the agreements that govern these facilities that would permit\nthe lenders to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If we are unable to repay such amounts, lenders having secured obligations could proceed against the collateral securing these obligations. The collateral includes the capital stock of our domestic subsidiaries and substantially all of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 other tangible and intangible assets, subject in each case to certain exceptions. This could have serious consequences on our financial condition and results of operations and could cause us to become bankrupt or otherwise insolvent. In addition, these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that we believe would otherwise be in the best interests of our business and stockholders.\nSee Part II, \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Principal Debt Agreements\u201d for further details.\nSubstantially all of our debt is variable rate and increases in interest rates could negatively affect our financing costs and our ability to access capital.\nWe have exposure to future interest rates based on the variable rate debt under the Senior Secured Debt Facilities, and to the extent we raise additional debt in the capital markets to meet maturing debt obligations, to fund our capital expenditures and working capital needs and to finance future acquisitions. Daily working capital requirements are typically financed with operational cash flow and through borrowings under our 2019 ABL Facility, if needed. The interest rate on these borrowing arrangements is generally determined from the inter-bank offering rate at the borrowing date plus a pre-set margin. Although we employ risk management techniques to hedge against interest rate volatility, significant and sustained increases in market interest rates could materially increase our financing costs and negatively impact our reported results.\nIn addition, in certain circumstances, our variable rate indebtedness uses the London Interbank Offer Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. The LIBOR has been subject of national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d) announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for calculation of LIBOR after 2021. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include an increase in our financing costs and our ability to access capital. On March 5, 2021, the ICE Benchmark Administration, which administers LIBOR, and the FCA announced that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator, or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021, for all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR settings and one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings, and immediately after June 30, 2023 for the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR settings (the \u201cLIBOR Announcement\u201d).\nThese reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates will become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, although on July 29, 2021, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d), a U.S.-based group convened by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, formally recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its preferred replacement rate for LIBOR. Given the inherent differences between LIBOR and SOFR, or any other alternative benchmark rate that may be established, there are many uncertainties regarding a transition from LIBOR, including but not limited to the need to amend all contracts with LIBOR as the referenced rate and how this will impact the cost of variable rate debt and certain derivative financial instruments, or whether the COVID-19 pandemic will have further effect on LIBOR transition plans. In addition, SOFR or other replacement rates may fail to gain market acceptance. The elimination of LIBOR or any other changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR could have an adverse impact on the market value of and/or transferability of any LIBOR-linked securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us or on our overall financial condition or results of operations.\nFor certain U.S. dollar borrowings, our Senior Secured Debt Facilities currently bear interest at variable interest rates that use LIBOR. No modification has been made yet to our Senior Secured Debt Facilities as it pertains to USD borrowings as a result of the LIBOR Announcement, though changes will be required in the future. Currently, it is anticipated that the new benchmark for these USD borrowings will be SOFR. The shift to SOFR from LIBOR is complex and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity\nand cash flows. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include an increase in our financing costs and our ability to access capital. We do not expect the discontinuation of LIBOR as a reference rate in our debt agreements to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or materially affect our interest expense.\nDisruptions in the capital and credit markets, continued low commodity prices, our debt level and other factors may restrict our ability to raise capital on favorable terms, or at all.\nDisruptions in the capital and credit markets (which have and may continue to be impact by COVID-19), in particular with respect to companies in the energy sector, could limit our ability to access these markets or may significantly increase our cost to borrow. Continued low commodity prices, among other factors, have caused some lenders to increase interest rates, enact tighter lending standards which we may not satisfy as a result of our debt level or otherwise, refuse to refinance existing debt at maturity on favorable terms, or at all, and in certain instances have reduced or ceased to provide funding to borrowers. If we are unable to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms or at all, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAbility to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes is subject to limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, and NOLs and other tax attributes is subject to reduction, causing less NOL or tax deductions to be available to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purpose.\nUnder U.S. federal income tax law, a corporation is generally permitted to deduct from taxable income net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) carried forward from prior years. As of December 31, 2021, we reported consolidated federal NOL carryforwards of approximately $1.5 billion of which $842.1 million are pre-change NOL's subject to limitation. Our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income and to reduce U.S. federal income tax liability is subject to certain requirements and restrictions. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset future taxable income. An ownership change generally occurs if one or more stockholders (or groups of stockholders) who are each deemed to own at least 5% of our stock have aggregate increases in their ownership of such stock of more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders\u2019 lowest ownership percentage during the testing period (generally a rolling three year period). We believe we experienced an ownership change in October 2019 as a result of the C&J Merger. We also believe we experienced an ownership change in January 2017 as a result of the implementation of the IPO. Thus our pre-change NOLs are subject to limitation under Section 382 of the Code as a result. Such limitation may cause U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitation were not in effect and could cause a portion of our pre-change NOLs generated prior to 2018 to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares at or above the public offering price.\nThe market price for our common stock is volatile. In addition, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including:\n\u2022the failure of securities analysts to cover, or continue to cover, our common stock or changes in financial estimates by analysts;\n\u2022changes in, or investors\u2019 perception of, the oil field services industry, including hydraulic fracturing;\n\u2022the activities of competitors;\n\u2022future issuances and sales of our common stock, including in connection with acquisitions;\n\u2022our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022the public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022regulatory or legal developments in the U.S.;\n\u2022litigation involving us, our industry, or both; and\n\u2022general economic conditions, including increased levels of inflation.\nIn addition, the stock market often experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nBecause we do not currently pay dividends, our stockholders may not receive any return on investment, unless they sell their common stock for a price greater than that which they paid for it.\nWe do not currently pay dividends, and our stockholders do not have contractual or other rights, to receive dividends. Our board of directors may, in its discretion, modify or repeal our dividend policy. The declaration and payment of dividends depends on various factors, including: our net income, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.\nIn addition, we are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own. As a result, we would be dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from our subsidiaries to make dividend payments. Our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends is restricted by agreements governing their debt instruments and may be restricted by agreements governing any of our subsidiaries\u2019 future indebtedness. Furthermore, our subsidiaries are permitted under the terms of their debt agreements to incur additional indebtedness that may severely restrict or prohibit the payment of dividends. See Part II, \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), our board of directors may not authorize payment of a dividend unless it is either paid out of our surplus, as calculated in accordance with the DGCL, or if we do not have a surplus, it is paid out of our net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year.\nWe may not have an active capital return program, and such programs may not have the desired effect.\nAlthough our board of directors has approved share repurchase programs in the past, they generally have not obligated us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, would depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, the trading price of our common stock and the nature of other investment opportunities. Any future repurchase program may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. In addition, repurchases of our common stock pursuant to a share repurchase program could cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Furthermore, a share repurchase program could diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions. Although share repurchase programs are intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program\u2019s effectiveness.\nOur stockholders may be diluted by the future issuance of additional common stock in connection with our equity incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise.\nWe have 243,794,695 shares of common stock authorized but unissued under our certificate of incorporation. We will be authorized to issue these shares of common stock and options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to common stock for consideration and on terms and conditions established by our board of directors in its sole discretion, whether in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. As of December 31, 2021, we have 7,844,941 shares of our common stock available for award that may be issued under our equity incentive plans. Any common stock that we issue, including under our equity incentive plans or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in the future, may result in additional dilution to our stockholders.\nIn the future, we may also issue our securities, including shares of our common stock, in connection with investments or acquisitions. We regularly evaluate potential acquisition opportunities, including ones that would be significant to us, and at any one time we may be participating in processes regarding several potential acquisition opportunities, including ones that would be significant to us. We cannot predict the timing of any contemplated transactions, and none are currently probable. The number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of common stock. Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to our stockholders.\nKeane Investor and Cerberus own a significant amount of our common stock and continue to have influence over us, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.\nCerberus currently controls approximately 16.3% of our common stock. Even though Cerberus no longer controls a majority of our common stock, Cerberus continues to have influence over us, including the election of our directors, determination of our corporate and management policies and determination of the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders for approval, including potential mergers or acquisitions, asset sales and other significant corporate transactions. Two of our ten directors are employees of, appointees of, or advisors to, members of Cerberus. The interests of Cerberus may not coincide with the interests of other holders of our common stock. For example, the concentration of ownership held by Cerberus could delay, defer or prevent a change of control of our company or impede a merger, takeover or other business combination that may otherwise be favorable for us. Additionally, Cerberus is in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Cerberus may also pursue, for its own members\u2019 accounts, acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as Cerberus continues to directly or indirectly own a significant amount of our equity, Cerberus will continue to be able to substantially influence or effectively control our ability to enter into corporate transactions.\nIn addition, if Cerberus through Keane Investor decides to sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decrease. The perception in the public market that Keane Investor might sell shares of common stock could also create a perceived overhang and depress our market price.\nProvisions in our charter documents, certain agreements governing our indebtedness, our Stockholders\u2019 Agreement (as defined herein) and Delaware law could make acquiring us more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, even if beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our Stockholders\u2019 Agreement, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that some stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of our common stock. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, possibly depressing the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace members of our management team. Examples of such provisions are as follows:\n\u2022on or after such date that Keane Investor and its respective Affiliates (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, or any person who is an express assignee or designee of Keane Investor\u2019s respective rights under our certificate of incorporation (and such assignee\u2019s or designee\u2019s Affiliates)) (of these entities, the entity that is the beneficial owner of the largest number of shares is referred to as the \u201cDesignated Controlling Stockholder\u201d) ceases to own, in the aggregate, at least 50% of the then-outstanding shares of our common stock (the \u201c50% Trigger Date\u201d),the authorized number of our directors may be increased or decreased only by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the then-outstanding shares of our common stock or by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u2022on or after the 50% Trigger Date, our stockholders may only amend our bylaws with the approval of at least two-thirds of all of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote;\n\u2022the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from the board will be limited;\n\u2022on or after the 50% Trigger Date, stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and actions by our stockholders by written consent are prohibited;\n\u2022from and after such date that the Designated Controlling Stockholder ceases to own, in the aggregate, at least 35% of the then-outstanding shares of our common stock (the \u201c35% Trigger Date\u201d), advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of directors will be established;\n\u2022who may call stockholder meetings is limited;\n\u2022requirements on any stockholder (or group of stockholders acting in concert), other than, prior to the 35% Trigger Date, the Designated Controlling Stockholder, who seeks to transact business at a meeting or nominate directors for election to submit a list of derivative interests in any of our Company\u2019s securities, including any short interests and synthetic equity interests held by such proposing stockholder;\n\u2022requirements on any stockholder (or group of stockholders acting in concert) who seeks to nominate directors for election to submit a list of \u201crelated party transactions\u201d with the proposed nominee(s) (as if such nominating person were a registrant pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K, and the proposed nominee was an executive officer or director of the \u201cregistrant\u201d); and\n\u2022our board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined by our board of directors at the time of issuance or fixed by resolution without further action by the stockholders. These terms may include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion rights, redemption rights and sinking fund provisions. The issuance of preferred stock could diminish the rights of holders of our common stock, and therefore, could reduce the value of our common stock. In addition, specific rights granted to holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with, or sell assets to, a third party. The ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock could delay, discourage, prevent or make it more difficult or costly to acquire or effect a change in control, thereby preserving the current stockholders\u2019 control.\nIn addition, under the agreements governing the Senior Secured Debt Facilities, a change in control may lead the lenders and/or holders to exercise remedies such as acceleration of the obligations thereunder, termination of their commitments to fund additional advances and collection against the collateral securing such obligations.\nIn connection with the Keane IPO, Keane entered into a Stockholders\u2019 Agreement with Keane Investor. This stockholders\u2019 agreement was amended and restated in conjunction with the C&J Merger (as amended and restated, the \u201cStockholders\u2019 Agreement\u201d) and provides that, except as otherwise required by applicable law, from the date on which (a) Keane Investor or, in the event a Cerberus Holder no longer holds Company shares through Keane Investor, Cerberus Holder has beneficial ownership of at least 12.5% or greater of the aggregate number of company shares then outstanding, Keane Investor or, in the event Cerberus Holder no longer holds company shares through Keane Investor, Cerberus Representative shall have the right to designate to the board of directors two individuals who satisfy the Director Requirements; and (b) Keane Investor or, in the event Cerberus Holder no longer holder company shares through Keane Investor, Cerberus Holder has beneficial ownership of less than 12.5% but at least 7.5% of the aggregate number of company shares then outstanding, Keane Investor or, in the event Cerberus Holder no longer holds company shares through Keane Investor, Cerberus Representative shall have the right to designate to the board of directors one individual who satisfies the Director Requirements. The ability of Keane Investor or a Holder to appoint one or more directors could make an acquisition of us more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, even if beneficial to our stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for: (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (b) any action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders; (c) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws; or (d) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds more favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find this choice of forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 16557, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "NEX"}
