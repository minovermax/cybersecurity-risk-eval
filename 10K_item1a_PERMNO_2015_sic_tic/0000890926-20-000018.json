{"cik": "890926", "company": "RADIAN GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRadian Guaranty may fail to maintain its eligibility status with the GSEs.\nIn order to be eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs, mortgage insurers such as Radian Guaranty must meet the GSEs\u2019 eligibility requirements, or PMIERs. The PMIERs are comprehensive, covering virtually all aspects of the business of a private mortgage insurer, including internal risk management and quality controls, the relationship between the GSEs and the approved insurer and the approved insurer\u2019s financial condition, as well as extensive requirements related to the conduct and operations of a mortgage insurer\u2019s business. If Radian Guaranty is unable to satisfy the requirements set forth in the PMIERs, Freddie Mac and/or Fannie Mae could restrict it from conducting certain types of business with them or take actions that may include not purchasing loans insured by Radian Guaranty.\nThe PMIERs financial requirements currently require that a mortgage insurer\u2019s Available Assets meet or exceed its Minimum Required Assets. At December 31, 2019, Radian Guaranty was in compliance with the PMIERs financial requirements and had Available Assets of $3.6 billion, which resulted in an excess or \u201ccushion\u201d of $804 million over its Minimum Required Assets of $2.8 billion. Radian Guaranty\u2019s ability to continue to comply with the PMIERs financial requirements could be impacted by, among other factors: (i) the product mix of our NIW and factors affecting the performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio, including our level of new defaults, prepayments, the losses we incur on new or existing defaults and the credit characteristics of our mortgage insurance; (ii) the amount of credit that we receive under the PMIERs financial requirements for our third-party reinsurance transactions (which is subject to initial and ongoing review by the GSEs); and (iii) potential updates to the PMIERs, including an increase in the capital requirements under the PMIERs financial requirements.\nUnder the PMIERs financial requirements there are increased financial requirements for loans with a higher likelihood of default and/or certain credit characteristics, such as higher LTVs and lower FICO scores, as well as for loans originated after January 1, 2016 that are insured under lender-paid mortgage insurance policies not subject to automatic termination under the HPA. Therefore, if our mix of business includes more loans that are subject to these increased financial requirements, it increases the amount of Available Assets that Radian Guaranty is required to hold. Depending on the circumstances, we may limit the type and volume of business we are willing to write for certain of our products based on the increased financial requirements associated with certain loans. This could reduce the amount of NIW we write, which could reduce our revenues. Additionally, as we have experienced in the past, our insured loans may experience increased defaults in the future. Increases in defaults, including as a result of natural disasters, would subject Radian Guaranty to an increase in Minimum Required Assets under the PMIERs, and therefore, could impact our compliance with the PMIERs or negatively impact our results of operations.\nThe GSEs may amend the PMIERs at any time, although the GSEs have communicated that for material changes, including material changes affecting Minimum Required Assets, they will generally provide written notice 180 days prior to the effective date. The GSEs also have broad discretion to interpret the PMIERs, which could impact the calculation of Radian Guaranty\u2019s Available Assets and/or Minimum Required Assets. The most recent revisions to PMIERs, or PMIERs 2.0, became\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\neffective on March 31, 2019. We expect the GSEs to continue to update the PMIERs periodically in the future, including if and when there are changes to the GSEs\u2019 capital requirements, such as if and when the CCF is finalized.\nCompliance with the PMIERs financial requirements could impact our holding company liquidity. If additional capital is required to support Radian Guaranty\u2019s compliance with the PMIERs financial requirements, it may make it more difficult for Radian Guaranty to return capital to Radian Group in the form of dividends or otherwise, and depending on the circumstances, could require Radian Group to contribute capital through capital contributions or surplus notes to Radian Guaranty, which would leave less liquidity to satisfy Radian Group\u2019s other obligations. Depending on the amount of liquidity that is utilized from Radian Group, we may be required (or may decide) to seek additional capital by incurring additional debt, issuing additional equity, or selling assets, which we may not be able to do on favorable terms, if at all.\nIn addition to the PMIERs financial requirements, the PMIERs contain requirements related to the operations of our mortgage insurance business, including extensive operational requirements in areas such as claim processing, loss mitigation, document retention, underwriting, quality control, reporting and monitoring, among others. These increased operational requirements have resulted in additional expenses and have required substantial time and effort from management and our employees, which we expect will continue.\nThe PMIERs prohibit Radian Guaranty from engaging in certain activities such as insuring loans originated or serviced by an affiliate (except under certain circumstances) and require Radian Guaranty to obtain the prior consent of the GSEs before taking many actions, which may include entering into various intercompany agreements, settling loss mitigation disputes with customers and commuting risk, among others. These restrictions could prohibit or delay Radian Guaranty from taking certain actions that would be advantageous to it or its affiliates.\nAlthough we expect Radian Guaranty to retain its eligibility status with the GSEs and to continue to comply with the PMIERs financial requirements, including as potentially updated in the future, we cannot provide assurance that this will occur. Loss of Radian Guaranty\u2019s eligibility status with the GSEs would have an immediate and material adverse impact on the franchise value of our mortgage insurance business and our future prospects, as well as a material negative impact on our future results of operations and financial condition.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive state insurance regulations and other requirements, which we may fail to satisfy.\nWe and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive, detailed regulation by the insurance regulators in the states where they are domiciled or licensed to transact business. These regulations are principally designed for the protection of our insurance policyholders rather than for the benefit of our investors. Insurance laws vary from state to state, but generally grant broad supervisory powers to examine insurance companies and enforce rules or exercise discretion affecting almost every significant aspect of the insurance business, including the power to revoke or restrict an insurance company\u2019s ability to write new business. Among other matters, the state insurance regulators impose various capital requirements on our insurance subsidiaries.\nState insurance capital requirements for our mortgage insurance subsidiaries include Risk-to-capital ratios, other risk-based capital measures and surplus requirements that may limit the amount of insurance that our mortgage insurance subsidiaries write or the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to distribute capital to Radian Group. Similarly, our title insurance subsidiary is required to maintain statutory premium reserves that vary by state and subject to periodic reviews of certain financial performance ratios, and the results of those ratios could result in additional capital requirements in states where it is licensed. Our failure to maintain adequate levels of capital in our mortgage insurance and title insurance subsidiaries, among other things, could lead to intervention by the various insurance regulatory authorities, which could materially and adversely affect our business, business prospects and financial condition.\nWith respect to our mortgage insurance subsidiaries, there are 16 states that currently impose a Statutory RBC Requirement. If Radian Guaranty is not in compliance with a state\u2019s applicable Statutory RBC Requirement, it may be prohibited from writing new business in that state until it is back in compliance or it receives a waiver of, or similar relief from, the requirement. As of December 31, 2019, Radian Guaranty was in compliance with all applicable Statutory RBC Requirements. In states that do not have a Statutory RBC Requirement, it is not clear what actions the applicable state regulators would take if a mortgage insurer fails to meet the Statutory RBC Requirement established by another state. If Radian Guaranty were to fail to meet the Statutory RBC Requirement in one or more states, it could be required to suspend writing business in some or all of the states in which it does business. In addition, the GSEs and our mortgage lending customers may decide not to conduct new business with Radian Guaranty (or may reduce current business levels) or impose restrictions on Radian Guaranty while it was not in compliance. The franchise value of our mortgage insurance business likely would be\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nsignificantly diminished if we were prohibited from writing new business or restricted in the amount of new business we could write in one or more states.\nRadian Group also may be required to provide capital support for Radian Guaranty and its affiliated insurers if additional capital is required by those subsidiaries pursuant to future changes to insurance laws and regulations. The NAIC is in the process of reviewing the minimum capital and surplus requirements for mortgage insurers and considering changes to the Model Act. The NAIC working group overseeing this initiative has released an exposure draft of a revised Model Act, including new proposed mortgage guaranty insurance capital requirements. As proposed, the capital requirements set forth in the current exposure draft are impacted, among other things, by changes in the economic and housing environment, including changes in home prices and incomes. Although the outcome of this process remains uncertain, given the current economic and housing environment, if the exposure draft of the new Model Act was adopted and in effect today, we do not believe that the capital requirements imposed by the new Model Act would exceed those of the current PMIERs financial requirements.\nThe mortgage insurance industry has always been highly competitive with respect to pricing. Our mortgage insurance subsidiaries\u2019 premium rates and policy forms are generally subject to regulation in every state in which they are licensed to transact business. These regulations are intended to protect policyholders against the adverse effects of excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory rates and to encourage fair competition in the insurance marketplace. In most states where our insurance subsidiaries are licensed, premium rates and policy forms must be filed with the state insurance regulatory authority and, in some states, must be approved, before their use. We may be subject to regulatory inquiries or examinations with respect to our mortgage insurance premium rates and policy forms.\nOur title insurance business is subject to extensive rate regulation by the applicable state agencies in the states in which it operates. Title insurance rates are regulated differently in various states, with some states requiring the subsidiaries to file and receive approval of rates before such rates become effective and some states promulgating the rates that can be charged. In general, premium rates are determined on the basis of historical data for claim frequency and severity as well as related production costs and other expenses.\nGiven that the premium rates for our insurance subsidiaries are highly regulated, we could lose business opportunities and fail to successfully implement our business strategies if we are unable to respond to competitor pricing actions and our customers\u2019 demands in a timely and compliant manner.\nThe credit performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio is impacted by macroeconomic conditions and specific events that affect the ability of borrowers to pay their mortgages.\nAs a seller of mortgage credit protection, our results are subject to macroeconomic conditions and specific events that impact the housing finance and real estate markets, including events that impact mortgage originations and the credit performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio. Many of these conditions are beyond our control, including housing prices, unemployment levels, interest rate changes, the availability of credit and other factors that may be derived from national and regional economic conditions. In general, a deterioration in economic conditions increases the likelihood that borrowers will be unable to satisfy their mortgage obligations. A deteriorating economy can adversely affect housing values, which in turn can influence the willingness of borrowers to continue to make mortgage payments despite having the financial resources to do so.\nMortgage defaults can occur due to a variety of specific events affecting borrowers, including death or illness, divorce or other family problems, unemployment, or other events. In addition, factors impacting regional economic conditions, acts of terrorism, war or other severe conflicts, event-specific economic depressions or other catastrophic events such as natural disasters and pandemics could result in increased defaults due to the impact of such events on the ability of borrowers to satisfy their mortgage obligations and the value of affected homes.\nUnfavorable macroeconomic developments and the other factors cited above could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nThe length of time that our mortgage insurance policies remain in force could decline and result in a decrease in our future revenues.\nAs of December 31, 2019, 72% of our total primary IIF consists of policies for which we expect to receive premiums in the future, typically through Monthly Premium Policies. As a result, most of our earned premiums are derived from insurance that was written in prior years. The length of time that this insurance remains in force, which we refer to as the Persistency Rate, is a significant driver of our future revenues, with a lower overall Persistency Rate generally reducing our future revenues. The factors affecting the length of time that our insurance remains in force include:\n\u2022\nprevailing mortgage interest rates compared to the mortgage rates on our IIF, which affects the incentive for borrowers to refinance (i.e., lower current interest rates make it more attractive for borrowers to refinance and receive a lower interest rate);\n\u2022\napplicable policies for mortgage insurance cancellation, along with the current value of the homes underlying the mortgages in our IIF;\n\u2022\nthe credit policies of lenders, which may make it more difficult for homeowners to refinance loans; and\n\u2022\neconomic conditions that can affect a borrower\u2019s decision to pay off a mortgage earlier than required, including the strength of the housing market, which impacts a borrower\u2019s prospects for selling their existing home and finding a suitable and affordable new home.\nIf these or other factors cause a decrease in the length of time that our Monthly Premium Policies (or other policies for which we expect to receive premiums in the future) remain in force, our future revenues could be negatively impacted, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Loss Mitigation Activity is not expected to mitigate mortgage insurance losses to the same extent as in prior years; Loss Mitigation Activity could continue to negatively impact our customer relationships.\nAs part of our claims management process we pursue opportunities to mitigate losses both before and after we receive claims, including processes to ensure claims are valid. Following the financial crisis, our Loss Mitigation Activities, such as Rescissions, Claim Denials and Claim Curtailments, increased significantly in response to the poor underwriting, servicer negligence and general non-compliance with our insurance policies that was prevalent in the period leading up to the financial crisis. These Loss Mitigation Activities materially mitigated our paid losses for loans originated and serviced during this period and resulted in a significant reduction in our loss reserves. Following the financial crisis, mortgage underwriting and servicing have generally improved, and the amount of Loss Mitigation Activity required with respect to the claims on loans originated and serviced in more recent periods has significantly decreased. As a result, our future Loss Mitigation Activity is not expected to mitigate our paid losses to the same extent as it did in the years following the financial crisis.\nIn addition, under our 2014 Master Policy, for NIW after October 1, 2014, our rights to conduct Loss Mitigation Activity generally are more limited than under our prior master insurance policies. Radian Guaranty offers 12-month and 36-month rescission relief programs in accordance with the specified terms and conditions set forth in our 2014 Master Policy. Further, in December 2017, the FHFA and the GSEs proposed revised GSE Rescission Relief Principles to further clarify the circumstances under which mortgage insurers may rescind coverage, and required private mortgage insurers to implement these principles into their master policies for loans insured going forward. Our 2020 Master Policy incorporates these principles. Among other things, the 2020 Master Policy includes a new 60-month rescission relief program that provides that a loan may be eligible to qualify for rescission relief even if the loan failed to meet the conditions required to receive 36-month rescission relief. The 2020 Master Policy will apply to applications received on or after March 1, 2020. The reduction in the Loss Mitigation rights available under our 2014 Master Policy and 2020 Master Policy could result in higher losses than would have been the case under our Prior Master Policy.\nOur Loss Mitigation Activities and claims paying practices have resulted in disputes with certain of our customers and in some cases, damaged our relationships with customers, resulting in a loss of business. While we have resolved many of these disputes, a risk remains that our Loss Mitigation Activities or claims paying practices could continue to have a negative impact on our relationships with customers or potential customers. Further, disputes with our customers that are not resolved could result in additional arbitration or judicial proceedings, requiring significant legal expenses, beyond those we are currently facing. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d To the extent that past or future Loss Mitigation Activities or claims paying practices impact our customer relationships, our competitive position could be adversely affected, resulting in the potential loss of business and impacting our results of operations.\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nChanges in the charters, business practices, or role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing market generally, could significantly impact our mortgage insurance business.\nOur current business model is highly dependent on the GSEs as the GSEs are the primary beneficiaries of most of our mortgage insurance policies. The GSEs\u2019 federal charters generally require credit enhancement for low down payment mortgage loans (i.e., a loan amount that exceeds 80% of a home\u2019s value) in order for such loans to be eligible for purchase by them. Lenders generally have used private mortgage insurance to satisfy this credit enhancement requirement. As a result, low down payment mortgages purchased by the GSEs generally are insured with private mortgage insurance. In order to be eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs, mortgage insurers such as Radian Guaranty must meet the GSEs\u2019 eligibility requirements, or PMIERs.\nThe GSEs\u2019 business practices may be impacted by their results of operations, by administrative policy decisions (such as a desire to increase the competitiveness of private capital executions in the secondary mortgage market) as well as by legislative or regulatory changes. Since September 2008, the GSEs have been operating under the conservatorship of the FHFA. With respect to loans purchased by the GSEs, changes in the business practices of the GSEs, which can be implemented by the GSEs acting independently or through their conservator, the FHFA, could negatively impact our mortgage insurance business and financial performance, including changes to:\n\u2022\neligibility requirements for a mortgage insurer to become and remain an approved eligible insurer for the GSEs;\n\u2022\nunderwriting standards on mortgages they purchase, including as a result of the FHFA\u2019s current focus on reducing the GSEs\u2019 risk profile with respect to loans with multiple higher risk characteristics;\n\u2022\npolicies or requirements that may result in a reduction in the number of mortgages they acquire;\n\u2022\nthe national conforming loan limit for mortgages they acquire;\n\u2022\nthe level of mortgage insurance required, including expanding the loans that are eligible for reduced insurance coverage;\n\u2022\nthe terms on which mortgage insurance coverage may be canceled before reaching the cancellation thresholds established by law;\n\u2022\nthe terms required to be included in master policies for the mortgage insurance policies they acquire, including limitations on our ability to mitigate losses on insured mortgages that are in default;\n\u2022\nthe amount of loan level price adjustments (based on risk) or guarantee fees (which may result in a higher cost to borrowers) that the GSEs charge on loans that require mortgage insurance; and\n\u2022\nthe degree of influence that the GSEs have over a mortgage lender\u2019s selection of the mortgage insurer providing coverage.\nThe FHFA has called for the GSEs to transfer a meaningful portion of credit risk, known as a \u201ccredit risk transfer,\u201d to the private sector. This mandate builds upon the goals set in each of the last four years for the GSEs to increase the role of private capital by experimenting with different forms of transactions and structures. We continue to participate in these credit risk transfer programs developed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Additional information about these programs may be found in Item 1. Business, see \u201cRegulation-Federal Regulation-Housing Finance Reform\u201d and \u201cMortgage Insurance-Mortgage Insurance Business Overview-Mortgage Insurance Products-Other Mortgage Insurance Products-GSE Credit Risk Transfer.\u201d\nIt is difficult to predict what other types of credit risk transfer transactions and structures may be used in the future. If any of the credit risk transfer transactions and structures were to displace primary loan level or standard levels of mortgage insurance, the amount of insurance we write may be reduced, which could negatively impact our franchise value, results of operations and financial condition. As a result, the impact of any credit risk transfer products and transactions or other structures implemented by the GSEs is uncertain and hard to predict. For example, in 2018 Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae announced the launch of pilot programs, IMAGIN and EPMI, respectively, as alternative ways for lenders to obtain credit enhancement and sell loans with LTVs greater than 80% to the GSEs. These investor-paid mortgage insurance programs, in which insurance is acquired directly by each GSE, have many of the same features as private mortgage insurance and represent an alternative to traditional private mortgage insurance products that are provided to individual lenders. Participants in IMAGIN and EPMI are not subject to compliance with the PMIERs which may create a competitive disadvantage for private mortgage insurers if these pilot programs are expanded. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Federal Regulation-Housing Finance Reform.\u201d\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nSince the FHFA was appointed as conservator of the GSEs, there has been a wide range of legislative proposals to reform the U.S. housing finance market, including proposals for GSE reform ranging from some that advocate nearly complete privatization and elimination of the role of the GSEs to others that support a system that combines a federal role with private capital. In September 2019, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and HUD released the Treasury Plan and the HUD Plan to reform the housing finance market, and with respect to the Treasury Plan, to release the GSEs from conservatorship after certain conditions were met. Leadership at the FHFA and HUD have stated that they plan to use the Plans to guide the direction and activities of the GSEs and FHA. With the Plans serving as a roadmap, we expect HUD and FHFA will continue to take actions to shape the role of the FHA and GSEs in the housing finance market and to prepare the GSEs to exit conservatorship. In particular, the FHFA has stated a desire to reduce the GSEs\u2019 exposure to loans with multiple higher risk characteristics in light of the fact that the GSEs currently maintain limited capital positions to support such risk. It is difficult to predict whether or how the Treasury Plan and HUD Plan may be implemented and what impact actions taken in furtherance of these plans could have on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Federal Regulation-Housing Finance Reform.\u201d\nThe future structure of the residential housing finance system remains uncertain, including whether comprehensive housing reform legislation will be adopted and, if so, what form it may ultimately take. It is difficult to predict the impact of any changes on our business. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Federal Regulation-Housing Finance Reform.\u201d Although we believe that traditional private mortgage insurance will continue to play an important role in any future housing finance structure, developments in the practices of the GSEs, including potentially new federal legislation that reduces the level of private mortgage insurance coverage used by the GSEs as credit enhancement, or even eliminates the requirement, may diminish the franchise value of our mortgage insurance business and materially and adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nA decrease in the volume of mortgage originations could result in fewer opportunities for us to write new mortgage insurance business.\nThe amount of new business we write depends, among other things, on a steady flow of low down payment mortgages that benefit from our mortgage insurance. The volume of low down payment mortgage originations is impacted by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on mortgage credit due to changes in lender underwriting standards, capital requirements affecting lenders, regulatory requirements such as the QM designation for mortgage loans, and the health of the private securitization market;\n\u2022\nmortgage interest rates;\n\u2022\nthe health of the domestic economy generally, as well as specific conditions in regional and local economies;\n\u2022\nhousing affordability;\n\u2022\ntax laws and policies and their impact on, among other things, deductions for mortgage insurance premiums, mortgage interest payments and real estate taxes;\n\u2022\ndemographic trends, including the rate of household formation;\n\u2022\nthe rate of home price appreciation;\n\u2022\ngovernment housing policy encouraging loans to first-time homebuyers; and\n\u2022\nthe practices of the GSEs, including the extent to which the guaranty fees, loan level price adjustments (based on risk), credit underwriting guidelines and other business terms provided by the GSEs affect the cost of mortgages and lenders\u2019 willingness to extend credit for low down payment mortgages.\nIf the overall volume of new mortgage originations declines, we could experience a reduced opportunity to write new insurance business and likely will be subject to increased competition, which could negatively affect our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur NIW and franchise value could decline if we lose business from significant customers.\nOur mortgage insurance business depends on our relationships with our customers. Our customers place insurance with us directly on loans they originate and they also do business with us indirectly through purchases of loans that already have our mortgage insurance coverage. Our relationships with our customers may influence both the amount of business they conduct with us directly and also their willingness to continue to approve us as a mortgage insurance provider for loans that they\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\npurchase. The loss of business from significant customers could have an adverse effect on the amount of new business we are able to write, and consequently, our franchise value.\nDuring 2019, our top 10 mortgage insurance customers (measured by NIW) were responsible for 34.3% of our primary NIW, as compared to 29.1% in 2018. If we were to lose a significant customer, it is unlikely that the loss could be completely offset by other customers in the near-term, if at all. Some of our lending customers may decide to write business only with a limited number of mortgage insurers or only with certain mortgage insurers, based on their views with respect to an insurer\u2019s pricing, service levels, underwriting guidelines, loss mitigation practices, financial strength or other factors. Alternatively, certain other lending customers have chosen for risk management purposes to diversify the mortgage insurers with which they do business, which may negatively affect our level of NIW and market share with those customers. Given that many of our customers currently give us a significant portion of their total mortgage insurance business, it is possible that further diversification could have a negative impact on our NIW if we are unable to mitigate the market share loss through new customers or increases in business with other customers. Further, we actively engage with our customers to ensure that we are receiving an appropriate mix of business from such customers at acceptable projected returns, and depending on the circumstances, we could take action with respect to customers (e.g., limiting the type of business we accept from them or instituting pricing changes that impact them) that could result in customers reducing the amount of business they do with us or deciding not to do business with us altogether. Any significant loss in our market share could negatively impact our mortgage insurance franchise, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur mortgage insurance business faces intense competition.\nThe U.S. mortgage insurance industry is highly competitive. Our competitors primarily include other private mortgage insurers and governmental agencies, principally the FHA and VA.\nWe currently compete with other private mortgage insurers that are eligible to write business for the GSEs primarily on the basis of price, underwriting guidelines, overall service, customer relationships, perceived financial strength (including comparative credit ratings) and reputation. Overall service competition is based on, among other things, effective and timely delivery of products, timeliness of claims payments, customer service, timely and accurate servicing of policies, training, loss mitigation efforts and management and field service expertise. We also believe that service includes our ability to offer services to customers through our Services business that complement our mortgage insurance products. For more information about our competitive environment, including pricing competition, see \u201cItem 1. Business-Mortgage Insurance-Competition.\u201d\nIn developing our pricing and origination strategies, we monitor various competitive and economic factors while seeking to enhance the long-term value of our portfolio by balancing credit risk, profitability and volume and capital considerations. Pricing strategies continue to evolve in the mortgage insurance industry and mortgage insurers generally have migrated to offering various pricing methodologies with differing degrees of risk-based granularity. The shift away from a predominantly rate-card-based pricing model and the increase in \u201cblack box\u201d pricing frameworks provides a more dynamic pricing environment that has led to an increase in the frequency of pricing changes throughout the mortgage insurance industry and a reduction in pricing transparency. As a result, we may not be aware of rate changes in the industry until we observe that our volume of NIW has changed. Further, this shift in risk-based, granular pricing methodologies, as well as the development of enhanced digital technologies for delivering and receiving price quotes, has led to an increasing number of customers making their choice of mortgage insurance providers based on the lowest price available for any particular loan, without consideration of other factors.\nThe evolution of pricing changes in the mortgage insurance industry has heightened overall competition and generally reduced pricing for our mortgage insurance. This reduction in our premium rates is expected to decrease the premium yield of our insured portfolio over time as older vintage insured loans with higher premium rates run-off and are replaced with insured loans with lower premium rates.\nOverall, our approach to pricing is customer-centric and flexible, as we offer a spectrum of risk-based pricing solutions for our customers that are designed to be balanced with our objectives for managing our volume of NIW and the risk/return profile of our insured portfolio. Although we believe we are well-positioned to compete effectively, our pricing strategy may not be successful. Despite our pricing actions, we may experience returns below our targeted returns and we may lose business to other competitors. There can be no assurance that pricing competition will not intensify further, which could result in a decrease in our projected returns.\nCertain of our private mortgage insurance competitors are subsidiaries of larger corporations, may have access to greater amounts of capital and financial resources than we do at a lower cost of capital (including off-shore reinsurance vehicles) and currently have better financial strength ratings than we have. As a result, they may be better positioned to compete outside of traditional mortgage insurance, including in the private label securitization market or if the GSEs expand their use of, or pursue\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nalternative forms of, credit enhancement outside of private mortgage insurance in its traditional form. In addition, because of tax advantages associated with being off-shore, certain of our competitors have been able to reinsure to their offshore affiliates and achieve higher after-tax rates of return on the NIW they write compared to mortgage insurers such as Radian Guaranty that do not have access to offshore affiliates, which could allow these off-shore competitors to leverage reduced pricing to gain market share, while continuing to achieve acceptable returns on NIW.\nWe also compete with governmental entities, such as the FHA and VA, primarily on the basis of loan limits, pricing, credit guidelines, terms of our insurance policies and loss mitigation practices. These governmental entities typically do not have the same capital requirements or business objectives that we and other private mortgage insurance companies have, and therefore, may have greater financial flexibility in their pricing guidelines and capacity that could put us at a competitive disadvantage. If these entities lower their pricing or alter the terms and conditions of their mortgage insurance or other credit enhancement products in furtherance of political, social or other goals rather than a profit motive, we may be unable to compete in that market effectively, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nBeginning in 2008, the FHA, which historically had not been a significant competitor, substantially increased its share of the mortgage insurance market, including by insuring a number of loans that would meet our current underwriting guidelines, sometimes at a lower monthly cost to the borrower than a loan that carries our mortgage insurance. The FHA may continue to maintain a significant market position and could increase its market position. Factors that could cause the FHA to maintain or enhance its competitive position include:\n\u2022\ngovernmental policy, including decreases in the pricing of FHA insurance or changes in the terms of FHA insurance such as the current life-of-loan coverage requirement;\n\u2022\na coordinated effort by the FHFA and FHA to increase the FHA\u2019s share of certain high LTV loans currently purchased by the GSEs;\n\u2022\nchanges to the legal requirements (e.g., compliance certifications) for conducting business with the FHA, including those recently implemented, to reduce the perceived risk that lenders will be subject to liability in connection with loans insured by the FHA;\n\u2022\nchanges to the CFPB definition of QM that results in a broader definition of qualified mortgage for FHA eligible loans than GSE eligible loans;\n\u2022\ncapital requirements imposed on the private mortgage insurance industry;\n\u2022\nthe tightening by private mortgage insurers of underwriting guidelines based on credit risk concerns;\n\u2022\nbusiness changes by the GSEs, including underwriting changes, a reduction in loan limits or increases in the loan level price adjustments (based on risk) charged by the GSEs on loans that require mortgage insurance and changes in the amount of guarantee fees for the loans that they acquire (which may result in higher cost to borrowers); and\n\u2022\nthe perceived operational ease of using FHA insurance compared to the products of private mortgage insurers.\nOther private mortgage insurers may seek to compete for market share from the FHA or other mortgage insurers by reducing pricing, which could, in turn, improve their competitive position in the industry and negatively impact our level of NIW.\nWe have faced increasing competition from the VA. Based on publicly available information, the VA accounted for 26% of the insurable mortgage market in 2019. We believe that the VA\u2019s market share has generally been increasing because the VA offers 100% LTV loans and charges a one-time funding fee that can be included in the loan amount with no additional monthly expense, and because of an increase in the number of borrowers that are eligible for the VA\u2019s program.\nIn addition, as market conditions change, alternatives to private mortgage insurance may become more prevalent, which could reduce the demand for private mortgage insurance in its traditional form, including:\n\u2022\nstructures, such as the IMAGIN and EPMI pilot programs launched in 2018 by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, respectively, that are commonly referred to as \u201cinvestor paid mortgage insurance\u201d in which affiliates of traditional mortgage insurers directly insure the GSEs against loss;\n\u2022\nlenders and other investors holding mortgages in their portfolio and self-insuring;\n\u2022\nlenders using pass-through vehicles that take on the risk of loss for loans ultimately sold to the GSEs;\n\u2022\nstructured risk transfer transactions in the capital markets;\n\u2022\nrisk sharing, risk transfer or using other risk mitigation techniques in conjunction with reduced levels of private mortgage insurance coverage;\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\u2022\nlenders originating mortgages using \u201cpiggyback\u201d structures to avoid private mortgage insurance, such as a first-lien mortgage with an 80% LTV and a second mortgage with a 10%, 15% or 20% LTV; and\n\u2022\nother potential forms of credit enhancement that do not involve private mortgage insurance.\nSee \u201c-Changes in the charters, business practices, or role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing market generally, could significantly impact our mortgage insurance business.\u201d\nThe competitive environment is extremely challenging given the multitude of factors discussed above. This environment, as well as potential further changes to this evolving environment, could negatively impact our franchise value, business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business depends, in part, on effective and reliable loan servicing.\nWe depend on third-party servicing of the loans that we insure. Dependable servicing is necessary for timely billing and effective loss mitigation opportunities for delinquent or near-delinquent loans. Changes in the servicing industry, challenging economic and market conditions or periods of economic stress and high mortgage defaults could negatively affect the ability of servicers to effectively service the loans that we insure. Further, servicers are required to comply with a multitude of legal and regulatory requirements, procedures and standards for servicing residential mortgages such as the CFPB\u2019s mortgage servicing rules. While these requirements are intended to ensure a high level of servicing performance, they also impose a high cost of compliance on servicers that may impact their financial condition and their operating effectiveness. If we experience a disruption in the servicing of mortgage loans covered by our insurance policies, this, in turn, could contribute to a rise in defaults and/or claims among those loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAn extension in the period of time that a loan remains in our defaulted loan inventory may increase the severity of claims that we ultimately are required to pay.\nHigh levels of defaults and corresponding delays in foreclosures could delay our receipt of claims, resulting in an increase in the period of time that a loan remains in our defaulted loan inventory, and as a result, the Claim Severity. Following the financial crisis, the average time that it took for us to receive a claim increased. This was, in part, due to loss mitigation protocols that were established by servicers and also to a significant backlog of foreclosure proceedings in many states, and especially in those states that impose a judicial process for foreclosures. Generally, foreclosure delays do not stop the accrual of interest or affect other expenses on a loan, and unless a loan is cured during such delay, once title to the property ultimately is obtained and a claim is filed, our paid claim amount may include additional interest and expenses, increasing the Claim Severity. While foreclosure timelines have improved in recent years, a portion of our portfolio originated in the years prior to and including 2008 consists of severely delinquent loans. Further, another period of significant economic stress and a high level of defaults could once again delay claims and result in higher levels of Claim Severity. Higher levels of Claim Severity would increase our incurred losses and could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends on our ability to assess and manage our underwriting risks; the premiums we charge may not be adequate to compensate us for our liability for losses and the amount of capital we are required to hold against our insured risks. We expect to incur future provisions for losses beyond what we have reserved for in our financial statements.\nThe estimates and expectations we use to establish premium rates are based on assumptions made at the time our insurance is written. Our mortgage insurance premiums are based on, among other items, the amount of capital we are required to hold against our insured risks and our estimates of the long-term risk of claims on insured loans. Our premium rates are established based on performance models that consider a broad range of borrower, loan and property characteristics, as well as capital requirements and market and economic conditions. Our assumptions may ultimately prove to be inaccurate.\nIf the risk underlying a mortgage loan we have insured develops more adversely than we anticipated, we generally cannot increase the premium rates on this in-force business, or cancel coverage or elect not to renew coverage, to mitigate the effects of such adverse developments. Similarly, we cannot adjust our premiums if the amount of capital we are required to hold against our insured risks increases from the amount we were required to hold at the time a policy was written. As a result, if we are unable to compensate for or offset the increased capital requirements in other ways, the returns on our business may be lower than we assumed or expected. Our premiums earned and the associated investment income on those premiums may ultimately prove to be inadequate to compensate for the losses that we may incur and may not provide an adequate return on increased capital that may be required. As a result, our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nAdditionally, in accordance with industry practice, we do not establish reserves in our mortgage insurance business until we are notified that a borrower has failed to make at least two monthly payments when due. Because our mortgage insurance reserving does not account for the impact of future losses that we expect to incur with respect to performing (non-defaulted) loans, our obligation for ultimate losses that we expect to incur at any period end is not reflected in our financial statements, except to the extent that a premium deficiency exists. As a result, our losses can be more severe in periods of high defaults given that we generally are not permitted to establish reserves in anticipation of such defaults.\nIf the estimates we use in establishing loss reserves are incorrect, we may be required to take unexpected charges to income, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe establish loss reserves in our mortgage insurance business to provide for the estimated cost of future claims on defaulted loans. Setting our loss reserves requires significant judgment by management with respect to the likelihood, magnitude and timing of each potential loss, including an estimate of the impact of our Loss Mitigation Activities with respect to defaulted loans. The models, assumptions and estimates we use to establish loss reserves may not prove to be accurate, especially in the event of an extended economic downturn or a period of extreme market volatility and uncertainty. Because of this, claims paid may be substantially different than our loss reserves and these reserves may be insufficient to satisfy the full amount of claims that we ultimately have to pay. Changes to our estimates could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nA portion of the defaulted loans in our portfolio originated in the years prior to and including 2008 have been in default for an extended period of time. While these loans are generally assigned a higher loss reserve based on our belief that they are more likely to result in a claim, we also assume, based on historical trends, that a significant portion of these loans will cure or otherwise not result in a claim. Given the significant period of time that these loans have been in default, it is possible that the ultimate cure rate for these defaulted loans will be less than our current estimates of Cures for this inventory of defaults.\nIf our estimates are inadequate, we may be required to increase our reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur delegated underwriting program may subject our mortgage insurance business to unanticipated claims.\nIn our mortgage insurance business, we permit lenders to obtain mortgage insurance for residential mortgage loans originated and underwritten by them using Radian\u2019s pre-established underwriting guidelines. Once we accept a lender into our delegated underwriting program, we generally insure a mortgage loan originated by that lender based on our expectation that the lender has followed our specified underwriting guidelines in accordance with the endorsement. Under this program, a lender could commit us to insure a material number of loans with unacceptable risk profiles before we discover the problem and terminate that lender\u2019s delegated underwriting authority or pursue other rights that may be available to us, such as our rights to rescind coverage or deny claims.\nWe face risks associated with our contract underwriting business.\nWe provide third-party contract underwriting services for our customers. We provide these customers with limited indemnification rights with respect to those loans that we simultaneously underwrite for both secondary market compliance and for potential mortgage insurance eligibility. In addition, in certain circumstances, we may also offer limited indemnification when we underwrite a loan only for secondary market compliance. In addition to indemnification, we typically have limited loss mitigation defenses available to us for loans that we have underwritten through our contract underwriting services. As a consequence, our results of operations could be negatively impacted if we are required to indemnify our customers for material underwriting errors in our contract underwriting services.\nReinsurance may not be available, affordable or adequate to protect us against losses.\nIn our mortgage insurance business, we use reinsurance as a capital and risk management tool. We have distributed risk through third-party quota share and excess-of-loss reinsurance arrangements, as well as through the capital markets using mortgage insurance-linked notes transactions.\nThe availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to market conditions beyond our control. No assurance can be given that reinsurance will remain available to us in amounts that we consider sufficient and at rates that we consider acceptable. Accordingly, we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms, which could cause us to increase the amount of risk we retain, negatively affect the returns we are able to achieve on the business we write and adversely affect our ability to write future business. Further, reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to policyholders, therefore, if the reinsurer is unable or unwilling to meet its obligations to us, we remain liable to make claims payments to our policyholders. As a result, our reinsurance arrangements do not fully eliminate\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nour obligation to pay claims, and we have assumed credit risk with respect to our inability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. If we are unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms or to collect amounts due from our reinsurers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUncertainty relating to the potential discontinuance of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect us.\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that after 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit rate quotations required to calculate LIBOR. As a result, it is uncertain whether LIBOR will continue to be quoted after 2021. Efforts are underway to identify and transition to a set of alternative reference rates. The set of alternative rates includes the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), which the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing in 2018. In addition, central banks in several other jurisdictions have also announced plans for alternative reference rates for other currencies. There is considerable uncertainty as to how the financial services industry will address the expected discontinuance of LIBOR in financial instruments that are indexed to LIBOR. Financial instruments indexed to LIBOR could experience disparate outcomes based on their contractual terms, ability to amend those terms, market or product type, legal or regulatory jurisdiction, and other factors. Alternative reference rates that replace LIBOR may not yield the same or similar economic results over the lives of the financial instruments, which could adversely affect the value of and return on these instruments.\nAny changes to or discontinuation of LIBOR may have an adverse effect on the premium rates we are required to pay in connection with our existing insurance-linked notes transactions, which are tied to LIBOR, or other assets or liabilities whose value is tied to LIBOR or to a LIBOR alternative, including floating rate bonds we hold in our investment portfolio and borrowings under our credit facility which currently uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. Furthermore, changes to or the discontinuation of LIBOR may impact our investment portfolio and our cost of debt, as well as other aspects of our business, such as our insurance products, the pricing we charge and the models we use to support our business decisions. It is possible that the discontinuance or replacement of LIBOR, including the implementation of alternative benchmark rates to LIBOR, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe current financial strength ratings assigned to our mortgage insurance subsidiaries could weaken our competitive position.\nRadian Guaranty has been assigned a rating of Baa1 by Moody\u2019s and a rating of BBB+ by S&P. While Radian Guaranty\u2019s financial strength ratings currently are investment grade, these ratings are below the ratings assigned to certain other private mortgage insurers. We do not believe our ratings have had a material adverse effect on our relationships with existing customers. However, if financial strength ratings become a more prominent consideration for lenders, we may be competitively disadvantaged by customers choosing to do business with private mortgage insurers that have higher financial strength ratings. In addition, the current PMIERs do not include a specific ratings requirement with respect to eligibility, but if this were to change in the future, we may become subject to a ratings requirement in order to retain our eligibility status under the PMIERs.\nThe GSEs currently consider financial strength ratings, among other items, to determine the amount of collateral that an insurer must post when participating in the credit risk transfer transactions currently being conducted by the GSEs. As a result, the returns that we are able to achieve when participating in these transactions are dependent, in part, on our financial strength ratings. We currently use Radian Reinsurance to participate in the GSEs\u2019 credit risk transfer transactions. Radian Reinsurance has been assigned a rating of BBB+ by S&P. Market participants with higher ratings than us are assigned lower collateral requirements by the GSEs for these transactions and generally have a lower cost of capital, which may give them a competitive advantage, including the ability to price more aggressively for these transactions.\nWe believe that financial strength ratings remain a significant consideration for participants seeking to secure credit enhancement in the non-GSE mortgage market, which includes most non-qualified mortgage loans. While this market has remained limited since the financial crisis, we view this market as an area of potential future growth, which could be further accelerated by changes to the QM Rule currently under consideration by the CFPB, and our ability to successfully participate in this market could depend on our ability to secure higher ratings for our mortgage insurance subsidiaries. In addition, if legislative or regulatory changes were to alter the current state of the housing finance industry such that the GSEs no longer operate in their current capacity, we may be forced to compete in a new marketplace in which financial strength ratings may play a greater role. If we are unable to compete effectively in the current or any future markets as a result of the financial strength ratings assigned to our mortgage insurance subsidiaries, the franchise value and future prospects for our mortgage insurance business could be negatively affected.\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to manage risks in our investment portfolio.\nOur investment portfolio is an important source of revenue and is our primary source of claims paying resources. Although our investment portfolio consists mostly of highly-rated fixed income investments, our investment strategy is affected by general economic conditions, which may adversely affect the markets for credit and interest-rate-sensitive securities, including the extent and timing of investor participation in these markets, the level and volatility of interest rates and credit spreads and, consequently, the value of our fixed income securities, and as such, we may not achieve our investment objectives. Volatility or lack of liquidity in the markets in which we hold positions has at times reduced the market value of some of our investments, and if this worsens substantially it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nInterest rates and investment yields on our investments continue to be low compared to historical averages, which has reduced the investment income we generate. Although in recent years our portfolio yield has been increasing, continued low interest rates could negatively affect our portfolio yield. For the significant portion of our investment portfolio held by our insurance subsidiaries, to receive full capital credit under insurance regulatory requirements and under the PMIERs, we generally are limited to investing in highly-rated investments that are unlikely to increase our investment returns. Because we depend on our investments as a source of revenue, a prolonged period of lower than expected investment yields would have an adverse impact on our revenues and could potentially adversely affect our results of operations. Further, future updates to the NAIC Model Act or PMIERs could impact our investment choices, which could negatively impact our investment strategy.\nIn addition, we structure our investment portfolio to satisfy our expected liabilities, including claim payments in our mortgage insurance business. If we underestimate our liabilities or improperly structure our investments to meet these liabilities, we could have unexpected losses resulting from the forced liquidation of investments before their maturity, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRadian Group\u2019s sources of liquidity may be insufficient to fund its obligations.\nRadian Group serves as the holding company for our operating subsidiaries and does not have any operations of its own. As of December 31, 2019, Radian Group had available, either directly or through unregulated subsidiaries, unrestricted cash and liquid investments of $652.6 million. This amount excludes certain additional cash and liquid investments that have been advanced to Radian Group from our subsidiaries for corporate expenses and interest payments. Total liquidity, which includes our undrawn $267.5 million unsecured revolving credit facility entered into in October 2017, was $920.1 million as of December 31, 2019.\nWe expect Radian Group\u2019s principal liquidity demands for the next 12 months to be: (i) the payment of corporate expenses, including taxes; (ii) interest payments on our outstanding debt obligations; (iii) the payment of dividends on our common stock, which we recently increased to $0.125 per share; and (iv) the repurchases of Radian Group common stock pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program.\nIn addition to our ongoing short-term liquidity needs discussed above, our most significant need for liquidity beyond the next 12 months is the repayment of $900 million aggregate principal amount of our senior debt due in future years. Radian Group\u2019s liquidity demands for the next 12 months or in future periods could also include: (i) early repurchases or redemptions of portions of our debt obligations and (ii) potential investments to support our business strategy, including potential additional capital contributions to our subsidiaries and possible acquisitions or investments in new businesses.\nIn addition to available cash and marketable securities, Radian Group\u2019s principal sources of cash to fund future liquidity needs include: (i) payments made to Radian Group by its subsidiaries under expense- and tax-sharing arrangements; (ii) net investment income earned on its cash and marketable securities; (iii) to the extent available, dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries; and (iv) amounts that Radian Guaranty is able to repay under the Surplus Notes. Radian Group also has in place a $267.5 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of bank lenders. At December 31, 2019, the full $267.5 million remains undrawn and available under the facility. Radian Group\u2019s expense-sharing arrangements with its principal operating subsidiaries require those subsidiaries to pay their allocated share of certain holding-company-level expenses, including interest payments on our outstanding senior notes. The expense-sharing arrangements between Radian Group and our mortgage insurance subsidiaries, as amended, have been approved by the Pennsylvania Insurance Department, but such approval may be modified or revoked at any time.\nIn light of Radian Guaranty\u2019s negative unassigned surplus related to operating losses in prior periods and the ongoing need to set aside contingency reserves, we do not anticipate that Radian Guaranty will be permitted under applicable insurance laws to pay ordinary dividends to Radian Group for the foreseeable future. Based on the typical 10-year holding requirement, Radian Guaranty is scheduled to release contingency reserves to unassigned surplus in material amounts beginning in 2024,\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nwhich should accelerate the reduction of its negative unassigned surplus. See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on contingency reserve requirements.\nFurther, the Services segment has not generated sufficient cash flows to pay dividends to Radian Group. In the event the cash flow from operations of the Services segment is not adequate to fund all of its needs, Radian Group may provide additional funds to the Services segment in the form of a capital contribution or an intercompany note.\nAs of December 31, 2019, certain of our subsidiaries have incurred federal NOLs that could not be carried-back and utilized on a separate company tax return basis. As a result, we are not currently obligated under our tax-sharing agreement to reimburse these subsidiaries for their separate company federal NOL carryforward. However, if in a future period, one of these subsidiaries utilizes its share of federal NOL carryforwards on a separate entity basis, then Radian Group may be obligated to fund such subsidiary\u2019s share of our consolidated tax liability to the IRS. Certain subsidiaries currently have federal NOLs on a separate entity basis that are available for future utilization. However, we do not expect to fund material obligations related to these subsidiary NOLs.\nIn light of Radian Group\u2019s short- and long-term needs, it is possible that our sources of liquidity could be insufficient to fund our obligations and could exceed available holding company funds. If this were to occur, we may need or otherwise may decide to increase our available liquidity, including by reducing our quarterly dividend or terminating our stock repurchase authorizations, incurring additional debt, by issuing additional equity or by selling assets, any of which we may be unable to do on favorable terms, if at all.\nOur revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants that could limit our operating flexibility. A default under our credit facility could trigger an event of default under the terms of our senior notes. We may not have access to funding under our credit facility when we require it.\nRadian Group is a party to a $267.5 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of bank lenders. As of December 31, 2019, no borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility.\nThe credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that, among other things, provide certain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, create liens, transfer or dispose of assets, merge with or acquire other companies and pay dividends. The credit facility also requires us to comply with certain financial covenants and further provides that: (i) Radian Group must be rated by S&P or Moody\u2019s and (ii) Radian Guaranty must remain eligible under the PMIERs to insure loans purchased by the GSEs. A failure to comply with these covenants or the other terms of the credit facility could result in an event of default, which could: (a) result in the termination of the commitments by the lenders to make loans to Radian Group under the credit facility and (b) enable the lenders to declare, subject to the terms and conditions of the credit facility, any outstanding obligations under the credit facility to be immediately due and payable.\nFurther, the occurrence of an event of default under the terms of our credit facility may trigger an event of default under the terms of our senior notes. An event of default would occur under the terms of our senior notes if a default: (i) in any scheduled payment of principal of other indebtedness by Radian Group or its subsidiaries of more than $100 million principal amount occurs, after giving effect to any applicable grace period or (ii) in the performance of any term or provision of any indebtedness of Radian Group or its subsidiaries in excess of $100 million principal amount occurs that results in the acceleration of the date such indebtedness is due and payable, subject to certain limited exceptions. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the carrying value of our senior notes.\nIf the commitments of the lenders under the credit facility are terminated or we are unable to satisfy certain covenants or representations, we may not have access to funding in a timely manner, or at all, when we require it. If funding is not available under the credit facility when we require it, our ability to continue our business practices or pursue our current strategy could be limited. If the indebtedness under the credit facility or our senior notes is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it.\nOur credit facility terminates on October 16, 2020 and we may be unable to renew or replace this facility on acceptable terms. If we are unable to obtain new financing or funding when needed, or if there were to be an event of default under our credit facility or senior notes for any reason, our cash flows, financial results or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not continue to pay dividends at the same rate we are currently paying them, or at all, and any decrease in or suspension of payment of a dividend could cause our stock price to decline.\nEffective February 13, 2020, Radian Group\u2019s board of directors authorized an increase to the Company\u2019s quarterly cash dividend to $0.125 per share effective for the quarterly dividend payable in March 2020. The payment of future cash dividends\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nis subject to the determination each quarter by our board of directors that the dividend remains in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders, which determination will be based on a number of factors, including, among others, economic conditions, our earnings, financial condition, actual and forecasted cash flows, capital resources, capital requirements and alternative uses of capital, including potential investments to support our business strategy and possible acquisitions or investments in new businesses. Any decrease in the amount of the dividend, or suspension or discontinuance of payment of a dividend, could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur reported earnings are subject to fluctuations based on changes in our trading securities, equity securities and short-term investments that require us to adjust their fair market value.\nWe have significant holdings of trading securities, equity securities and short-term investments that we carry at fair value. Because the changes in fair value of these financial instruments are reflected on our statements of operations each period, they affect our reported earnings and can create earnings volatility. Among other factors, interest rate changes, market volatility and declines in the value of underlying collateral will impact the value of our investments, potentially resulting in unrealized losses that could negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur information technology systems may fail or become outmoded, be temporarily interrupted or otherwise cause us to be unable to meet our customers\u2019 demands.\nOur business is highly dependent on the effective operation of our information technology systems, which are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, security breaches, catastrophic events and errors in usage. Although we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place, we may not be able to adequately execute these plans in a timely fashion.\nAdditionally, our ability to meet the needs of our customers depends on our ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available or otherwise upgrade our technological capabilities. We rely on e-commerce and other technologies to provide our products and services to our customers, and they generally require that we provide an increasing number of our products and services electronically. Accordingly, we may not satisfy our customers\u2019 requirements if we fail to invest sufficient resources or are otherwise unable to maintain and upgrade our technological capabilities. Further, customers may choose to do business only with business partners with which they are technologically compatible and may choose to retain existing relationships with mortgage insurance or mortgage and real estate services providers rather than invest the time and resources to on-board new providers. As a result, technology can represent a potential barrier to signing new customers.\nBecause we rely on our information technology systems for many critical functions, including connecting with our customers, if such systems were to fail, experience a prolonged interruption, or become outmoded, we may experience a significant disruption in our operations and in the business we receive, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, we are in the process of implementing a major technology project to improve our operating systems, including a new platform for our mortgage insurance underwriting, policy administration, claims management and billing processes. The implementation of these technological improvements is complex, expensive, time consuming and, in certain respects, depends on the ability of third parties to perform their obligations in a timely manner. If we fail to timely and successfully implement the new technology systems and business processes, or if the systems do not operate as expected, it could have an adverse impact on our business, business prospects and results of operations.\nWe could incur significant liability or reputational harm if the security of our information technology systems is breached, including as result of a cyberattack, or we otherwise fail to protect confidential information, including non-public personal information that we maintain.\nOur information technology systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic intrusions, computer viruses or other attacks, including cyberattacks. In recent years, cyberattacks such as distributed denial of service attacks, computer viruses, hacking, malware, ransomware, phishing or other forms of social engineering and insider threats designed to obtain confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or to cause other damage have grown in volume and level of sophistication. Further, the risks of cyberattacks and information security breaches continue to increase in businesses such as ours due to, among other things, the proliferation of new technologies and the use of digital channels to conduct our business, including connectivity with customer devices that are beyond our security control systems.\nAs part of our business, we, and certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates, maintain large amounts of confidential information, including non-public personal information on borrowers, consumers and our employees. If the security of our\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\ninformation technology is breached, including as a result of a cyberattack, it could result in the loss or misuse of this information, which could, in turn, result in potential regulatory actions or litigation, including material claims for damages, as well as interruption to our operations and damage to our customer relationships and reputation. While we have information security policies, controls and systems in place in order to attempt to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information, including non-public personal information, there can be no assurance that such use or disclosure will not occur. Any cybersecurity event or other compromise of the security of our information technology systems, or unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information, could subject us to liability, regulatory scrutiny and action, damage our reputation and negatively affect our ability to attract and maintain customers, and could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings.\nWe operate in highly regulated industries that are subject to a heightened risk of litigation and regulatory proceedings. We often are a party to material litigation and also are subject to legal and regulatory claims, assertions, actions, reviews, audits, inquiries and investigations. Additional lawsuits, legal and regulatory proceedings and inquiries and other matters may arise in the future. The outcome of existing and future legal and regulatory proceedings and inquiries and other matters could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restitutions or other relief which could require significant expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nLegislation and administrative and regulatory changes and interpretations could impact our businesses.\nOur businesses are subject to and may be impacted by many federal and state lending, insurance and consumer laws and regulations and may be affected by changes in these laws and regulations or the way they are interpreted or applied. In particular, our businesses may be significantly impacted by the following:\n\u2022\nlegislation, administrative or regulatory action impacting the charters or business practices of the GSEs;\n\u2022\nreform of the U.S. housing finance system;\n\u2022\nlegislation and regulation impacting the FHA and its competitive position versus private mortgage insurers;\n\u2022\nstate insurance laws and regulations that address, among other items, licensing of companies to transact business, claims handling, reinsurance requirements, premium rates, policy forms offered to customers and requirements for Risk-to-capital, minimum policyholder positions, reserves (including contingency reserves), surplus, reinsurance and payment of dividends;\n\u2022\nthe application of state, federal or private sector programs aimed at supporting borrowers and the housing market;\n\u2022\nthe application of RESPA, the FCRA and other laws to our businesses;\n\u2022\nnew federal standards and oversight for mortgage insurers, including as a result of the recommendation of the Federal Insurance Office of the U.S. Department of the Treasury that federal standards and oversight for mortgage insurers be developed and implemented;\n\u2022\nthe implementation of new regulations under, or the potential repeal or amendment of provisions of, the Dodd-Frank Act, including future changes in the QM Rule and QM loan requirements as are currently being contemplated by the CFPB; and\n\u2022\nthe implementation in the U.S. of the Basel III capital adequacy guidelines.\nSee \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation.\u201d\nAny of the items discussed above could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects. In addition, our businesses could be impacted by new legislation or regulations, as well as changes to existing legislation or regulations or the way they are interpreted or applied, including changes that are not currently contemplated and which could occur at any time.\nWe rely on our management team and our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain qualified personnel or successfully develop and/or recruit their replacements.\nOur success depends, in part, on the skills, working relationships and continued services of our management team and other key personnel, any of whom could terminate his or her relationship with us at any time. The unexpected departure of key personnel could adversely affect the conduct of our business. In such event, we would be required to obtain other personnel to\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nmanage and operate our business. In addition, we will be required to replace the knowledge and expertise of our workforce as our workers retire. In either case, there can be no assurance that we would be able to develop or recruit suitable replacements for the departing individuals, that replacements could be hired, if necessary, on terms that are favorable to us, or that we can successfully transition such replacements in a timely manner. Failure to effectively implement our succession planning efforts and to ensure effective transfers of knowledge and smooth transitions involving members of our management team and other key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Without a properly skilled and experienced workforce, our costs, including costs associated with a loss of productivity and costs to replace employees, may increase, and this could negatively impact our earnings.\nWe may make investments to grow our existing businesses, pursue new lines of business or new business initiatives, acquire other companies or engage in other strategic initiatives, each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties.\nIn support of our growth strategy, we may make strategic investments, acquisitions or pursue other strategic initiatives that expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that include, without limitation:\n\u2022\nthe use of capital and potential diversion of other resources, such as the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core businesses and potential disruption of those businesses;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of liabilities in connection with any strategic investment, including any acquired business;\n\u2022\nour ability to comply with additional regulatory requirements associated with new products, services, lines of business, or other business or strategic initiatives;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully integrate or develop the operations of any new business initiative or acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that any new business initiatives may be disruptive to our existing customer relationships;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition or other strategic investment or initiative, including expected synergies, cost savings, or sales or growth opportunities, within the anticipated timeframe or at all; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we may fail to achieve forecasted results for a strategic investment, acquisition or other initiative that could result in lower or negative earnings contribution and/or impairment charges associated with intangible assets acquired.\nWe face risks associated with our Services business.\nOur Services business exposes us to certain risks that may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition, including, among others, the following:\n\u2022\nOur Services revenue is dependent on a limited number of large customers that represent a significant proportion of our Services total revenues. The loss or reduction of business from one or more of these significant customers could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. In addition, Radian Guaranty does business with many of these significant customers. In the event of a dispute between a significant customer and either of our business segments, the overall customer relationship for Radian could be negatively impacted.\n\u2022\nDue to the transactional nature of our business, our Services segment revenues are subject to fluctuation from period to period and are difficult to predict.\n\u2022\nThe services we offer through our Services business are influenced by the level of overall activity in the mortgage, real estate and mortgage finance markets generally. If real estate transaction volumes decline, we could experience less demand for our real estate and title services.\n\u2022\nRed Bell is a licensed real estate brokerage and provides real estate brokerage services in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. As a licensed real estate brokerage, Red Bell receives residential real estate information from various multiple listing services (\u201cMLS\u201d). Red Bell receives this information, which it uses in its business to broker real estate transactions and provide valuation products and services, pursuant to the terms of agreements with the MLS providers. If these agreements were to terminate or Red Bell otherwise were to lose access to this information, it could negatively impact Red Bell\u2019s ability to conduct its business and our future real estate strategies.\n\u2022\nBy their nature, title claims are often complex, vary greatly in dollar amounts and are affected by economic and market conditions and the legal environment existing at the time of settlement of the claims. Estimating future title loss payments is difficult because of the complex nature of title claims, the long periods of time over which claims\nGlossary\nPart I Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nare paid, significantly varying dollar amounts of individual claims and other factors. From time to time, we could experience large losses or an overall worsening of our loss payment experience in regard to the frequency or severity of claims that require us to record additional charges to our claims loss reserve. These loss events are unpredictable and could adversely affect the financial performance of our Services business.", "PERMNO": 78038, "SIC": 6351, "TIC": "RDN"}
