RISK FACTORS\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks and uncertainties noted throughout this report, including those discussed below, which may affect the value of our securities. In addition to the risks discussed below, there may be additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem less significant that also may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, perhaps materially. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this report. Some statements in our risk factors constitute forward looking statements. Please refer to the section entitled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this report.\nRisk Factors Relating to TAL\nMarket conditions are very weak due to a combination of factors, including significant declines in steel prices, new container prices, and used container prices, and slower trade growth, all of which have led to much lower demand for containers.\nMarket conditions are unusually weak and such weakness is accelerating due to a combination of factors which have significantly reduced TAL\u2019s profitability. There has been an overall decline in worldwide commodity prices, and in particular, steel prices, which have declined approximately 40% from October 2014 through December 2015. Quarter to quarter world containerized trade growth decelerated significantly during 2015 as compared to the respective quarterly periods of 2014. The decline in steel prices, along with slower trade growth that has resulted in a reduced demand for containers, has contributed to a significant decline in the price of new containers, which along with low interest rates, has resulted in market lease rates reaching historically low levels. In addition, TAL has a large number of historically high rate leases that are expiring from 2016 through 2020 and those that have expired or been renegotiated have been re-priced at today\u2019s historically low lease rates. Used equipment is being sold at substantially lower prices, resulting in losses on the sale of equipment. All of the above factors are contributing to the pressure on TAL\u2019s profitability, and these current conditions are expected to continue. If these trends continue, TAL\u2019s profitability will decline further, which could limit the availability of its liquidity and capital resources and therefore constrain its ability to invest in additional containers, pay dividends or repurchase its common shares.\nMarket lease rates are currently historically very low. As a result, TAL\u2019s profitability may decline due to reduced returns on new investments and reduced profitability on existing containers as leases expire and lease rates are re-priced.\nMarket leasing rates decreased significantly from 2012 through 2015 due to a substantial decrease in new container prices, widely available low-cost financing for leasing companies and aggressive competition. This decrease in market leasing rates has negatively impacted the expected investment returns on our new container investments and it is reducing the profitability of the existing containers in our fleet as existing leases expire and are re-priced. From 2012 to 2015, the average lease rate in our fleet decreased 11.5% on a CEU basis. If market lease rates remain near their current low level for an extended period of time, we expect the decrease in our average lease rates to accelerate in 2016 and 2017 and have a substantial negative impact on our profitability.\nThe size of our owned fleet increased significantly from 2010 to 2011 due to our large purchases of new equipment and investments in sale-leaseback transactions. Many of the containers purchased in those years were purchased at relatively high prices and leased out at lease rates well above our portfolio average. As a result, the high level of procurement from 2010 through 2011 has created a concentration of leases with historically high leasing rates that began expiring in 2015 and will continue to expire through 2020. If container prices and market leasing rates remain near their current level for an extended period of time, we could be forced to re-lease those containers at significantly reduced lease rates. We estimate that the average current market leasing rates for new containers placed on long-term leases are approximately 55% lower than the average lease rates for containers purchased during 2010 and 2011. We also estimate that our annual leasing revenue would decrease by $1.7 million for each 1% reduction in the average lease rates on the containers purchased in 2010 and 2011.\nContainer leasing demand can be negatively affected by numerous market factors as well as external political and economic events that are beyond our control. Decreasing leasing demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDemand for containers depends largely on the rate of world trade and economic growth. Demand for leased containers is also driven by our customers\u2019 \u201clease vs. buy\u201d decisions. Cyclical recessions can negatively affect lessors\u2019 operating results because during economic downturns or periods of reduced trade, shipping lines tend to lease fewer containers, or lease containers only at reduced rates, and tend to rely more on their own fleets to satisfy a greater percentage of their requirements.\nAs a result, during periods of weak global economic activity, container lessors like TAL typically experience decreased leasing demand, decreased equipment utilization, lower average rental rates, decreased leasing revenue, decreased used container resale prices and significantly decreased profitability. These effects can be severe.\nFor example, our profitability decreased significantly from the third quarter of 2008 to the third quarter of 2009 due to the effects of the global financial crisis, and our profitability would have decreased further if trade activity did not start to recover at the end of 2009. In 2015, TAL\u2019s operating performance and profitability was also negatively impacted due to slower global trade growth resulting in reduced demand for leased containers, decreasing utilization, decreases in our lease rental revenue, decreased used container sales prices, and higher operating costs. These conditions have continued, and to some degree accelerated, in the first two months of 2016. If these trends continue, TAL\u2019s profitability will be negatively affected, which could constrain its ability to invest in additional containers, pay dividends or repurchase its common shares.\nOther general factors affecting demand for leased containers, container utilization and per diem rental rates include:\n\u2022\nthe available supply and prices of new and used containers;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic conditions, the operating efficiency of our customers and competitive pressures in the shipping industry;\n\u2022\nthe availability and terms of equipment financing for our customers;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency values;\n\u2022\nimport/export tariffs and restrictions;\n\u2022\ncustoms procedures;\n\u2022\nforeign exchange controls; and\n\u2022\nother governmental regulations and political or economic factors that are inherently unpredictable and may be beyond our control.\nAny of the aforementioned factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLease rates may still decrease further due to a decrease in new container prices, weak leasing demand, increased competition or other factors, resulting in reduced revenues, lower margins, and reduced profitability and cash flows.\nMarket leasing rates are typically a function of, among other things, new equipment prices (which are heavily influenced by steel prices), interest rates, the type and length of the lease, the equipment supply and demand balance at a particular time and location, and other factors more fully described below. A decrease in leasing rates can have a materially adverse effect on our leasing revenues, profitability and cash flow.\nA decrease in market leasing rates negatively impacts the leasing rates on both our new container investments and the existing containers in our fleet. Most of our existing containers are on operating leases, which means that the lease term is shorter than the expected life of the container, so the lease rate we receive for the container is subject to change at the expiration of the current lease. Lower new container prices, widespread availability of attractively priced financing, and aggressive competition for new leasing transactions continue to pressure market lease rates, and market lease rates are currently significantly below our portfolio average. As a result, during periods of low market lease rates, including the present period, the average lease rate received for our containers is negatively impacted by both the addition of new containers at low lease rates as well, and more significantly by, the turnover of existing containers from leases with higher lease rates to leases with lower lease rates.\nTAL faces risks associated with re-leasing containers after their initial fixed-term leases.\nTAL\u2019s containers have an economic useful life of approximately 13 to 15 years from the date a container was or is first leased to a customer. However, we may not lease containers for their full useful lives. When we purchase newly-produced containers, we may lease them out under fixed-term leases with contractual terms of one to five years at a lease rate that is, among other things, correlated to the price paid for the container. When these leases expire or are terminated, it may not be\npossible to re-lease these containers at rates that provide a reasonable economic return, or at all. If prevailing container lease rates decline significantly between the time a container is initially leased out and when its initial fixed-term lease expires, or if overall demand for containers declines, we may have to accept lower lease rates or experience a delay in re-leasing these containers, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLessee defaults may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow by decreasing revenues and increasing storage, positioning, collection, recovery and lost equipment expenses.\nOur containers and chassis are leased to numerous customers. Lease rentals and other charges, as well as indemnification for damage to or loss of our equipment, are payable under the leases and other arrangements by the lessees. Inherent in the nature of the leases and other arrangements for use of the equipment is the risk that once the lease is consummated, we may not receive, or may experience delay in receipt of all of the amounts to be paid in respect of the equipment. A delay or diminution in amounts received under the leases and other arrangements could adversely affect our business and financial prospects and our ability to make payments on our debt. In addition, not all of TAL\u2019s customers provide detailed financial information regarding their operations. As a result, customer credit risk is in part assessed on the basis of their reputation in the market, and there can be no assurance that they can or will fulfill their obligations under the contracts we enter into with them. Our customers could incur financial difficulties, or otherwise have difficulty making payments to us when due, for any number of factors that may be beyond our control and which we may be unable to anticipate.\nThe cash flow from our equipment, principally lease rentals, management fees and proceeds from the sale of owned equipment, is affected significantly by our ability to collect payments under leases and other arrangements for the use of the equipment and our ability to replace cash flows from terminating leases by re-leasing or selling equipment on favorable terms. All of these factors are subject to external economic conditions and performance by lessees and service providers that are beyond our control.\nIn addition, when lessees or sub-lessees of our containers and chassis default, we may fail to recover all of our equipment, and the containers and chassis we do recover may be returned in damaged condition or to locations where we will not be able to efficiently re-lease or sell them. As a result, we may have to repair and reposition these containers and chassis to other places where we can re-lease or sell them, and we may lose lease revenues and incur additional operating expenses in repossessing, repositioning and storing the equipment.\nWe believe that the risk of large lessee defaults remains elevated. Persistent excess vessel capacity has led to very low ocean freight rates which has resulted in, for certain carriers, large financial losses over the last several years. Over the next several years, new vessel deliveries are anticipated to remain at a high level. As a result, we expect excess vessel capacity to persist for several more years and expect the financial performance of our customers to remain under pressure.\nOur balance sheet includes an allowance for doubtful accounts as well as an equipment reserve related to the expected costs of recovering and remarketing containers currently in the possession of customers that have either defaulted or that we believe currently present a significant risk of loss. However, in accordance with GAAP, we do not maintain a general equipment reserve for equipment on-hire under operating leases to performing customers. As a result, any major customer default could have a significant impact on our profitability upon such default. Such a default could also have a material adverse effect on our business condition and financial prospects.\nOur customer base is highly concentrated. A default from any large customer, and especially our largest customer, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and future prospects. In addition, a significant reduction in leasing business from any of our large customers could have a material adverse impact on demand for our containers and our financial performance.\nOur five largest customers represented approximately 55% of our leasing revenues in 2015, with our single largest customer, CMA CGM, representing 16% of our leasing revenues and our second largest customer, NYK Line, representing 12% of our leasing revenues in 2015. No other customer exceeded 10% of our leasing revenues. Furthermore, the shipping industry has been consolidating for a number of years, and further consolidation is expected and could increase the portion of our revenues that come from our largest customers.\nGiven the high concentration of TAL\u2019s customer base, a default by any of its largest customers would result in a major reduction in our leasing revenue, large repossession expenses, potentially large lost equipment charges and a material adverse impact on our performance and financial condition. In addition, the loss or significant reduction in orders from any of TAL\u2019s major customers could materially reduce the demand for its containers and result in lower leasing revenue, higher operating expenses and diminished growth prospects.\nUsed container sales prices have decreased and may decrease further, leading to lower gains or losses on the disposal of our equipment.\nAlthough our revenues primarily depend upon equipment leasing, our profitability is also affected by the gains or losses we realize on the sale of used containers because, in the ordinary course of our business, we sell certain containers when they are returned by customers upon lease expiration. The volatility of the selling prices and gains or losses from the disposal of such equipment can be very significant. Used container selling prices, which can vary substantially, depend upon, among other factors, the cost of new containers, the global supply and demand balance for containers, the location of the containers, the supply and demand balance for used containers at a particular location, the physical condition of the container, refurbishment needs, materials and labor costs and obsolescence of certain equipment or technology. Most of these factors are outside of our control.\nContainers are typically sold if it is in our best interest to do so after taking into consideration local and global leasing and sale market conditions and the age, location, and physical condition of the container. As these considerations vary, gains or losses on sale of equipment will also fluctuate and may be significant if we sell large quantities of containers.\nUsed container selling prices and the gains or losses that we have recognized from selling used containers have varied widely over the last fifteen years.\nSelling prices for used containers and our disposal gains were exceptionally high from 2010 to 2012 due to a generally tight global supply and demand balance for containers. Since then, used container prices have declined. If disposal prices remain at the current low level or decrease further, it will have a significantly negative impact on TAL\u2019s financial performance and cash flow. This could constrain TAL\u2019s ability to invest in additional containers, pay dividends or repurchase its common shares.\nEquipment trading is dependent upon a steady supply of used equipment.\nWe purchase used containers for resale from our shipping line customers and other sellers. If the supply of equipment becomes limited because these sellers develop other means for disposing of their equipment or develop their own sales network, we may not be able to purchase the inventory necessary to meet our goals, and our equipment trading revenues and our profitability could be negatively impacted.\nAbrupt changes in sales prices on equipment purchased for resale could negatively affect our equipment trading margins.\nWe purchase and sell containers opportunistically as part of our equipment trading segment. We purchase equipment for resale on the premise that we will be able to sell this inventory in a relatively short time frame. If sales prices rapidly deteriorate and we are holding a large inventory of equipment that was purchased when prices for equipment were higher, then our gross margins could decline or become negative.\nOur customers may decide to lease fewer containers. Should shipping lines decide to buy a larger percentage of the containers they operate, our utilization rate and level of investment would decrease, resulting in decreased leasing revenues, increased storage costs, increased positioning costs and lower growth.\nWe, like other suppliers of leased containers, are dependent upon decisions by shipping lines to lease rather than buy their container equipment. Should shipping lines decide to buy a larger percentage of the containers they operate, our utilization rate would decrease, resulting in decreased leasing revenues, increased storage costs and increased positioning costs. A decrease in the portion of leased containers operated by shipping lines would also reduce our investment opportunities and significantly constrain our growth. Most of the factors affecting the decisions of our customers are outside of our control.\nWe face extensive competition in the container leasing industry.\nWe may be unable to compete favorably in the highly competitive container leasing and sales business. We compete with more than ten other major leasing companies, many smaller lessors, manufacturers of container equipment, companies offering finance leases as distinct from operating leases, promoters of container ownership and leasing as a tax shelter investment, shipping lines, which sometimes lease their excess container stocks, and suppliers of alternative types of equipment for freight transport. Some of these competitors may have greater financial resources and access to capital than we do. Additionally, some of these competitors may, at times, accumulate a high volume of underutilized inventories of containers, which could lead to significant downward pressure on lease rates and margins.\nCompetition among container leasing companies depends upon many factors, including, among others, lease rates, lease terms (including lease duration, drop-off restrictions and repair provisions), customer service, and the location, availability, quality and individual characteristics of equipment. The highly competitive nature of our industry may reduce lease rates and margins and undermine our ability to maintain our current level of container utilization or achieve our growth plans.\nThe demand for leased containers is particularly tied to international trade. If international trade were to decrease, it could reduce demand for container leasing, which would materially adversely affect TAL\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA substantial portion of TAL\u2019s containers are used in trade involving goods being shipped from exporting countries (e.g., China and other Asian countries) to importing countries (e.g., the United States or European nations). The willingness and ability of international consumers to purchase foreign goods is dependent upon political support for an absence of government-imposed barriers to international trade in goods and services. For example, international consumer demand for foreign goods is related to price; if the price differential between foreign goods and domestically-produced goods were to decrease due to increased tariffs on foreign goods, strengthening in the applicable foreign currencies relative to domestic currencies, rising foreign wages, increasing input or energy costs or other factors, then demand for foreign goods could decrease, which in turn could result in reduced demand for container leasing. A similar reduction in demand for container leasing could result from an increased use of quotas or other technical barriers to restrict trade. The current regime of relatively free trade may not continue, which would materially adversely affect TAL\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to finance capital expenditures, our business and growth plans will be adversely affected.\nWe make capital investments to, among other things, maintain and expand the size of our container fleet as market conditions allow. We have relied heavily on debt financing to help us fund our new container investments. During the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, bank financing became much more difficult to obtain and the asset securitization market was not available to us. In the future, our bank financing and asset-backed financing capacity could decrease, our financing costs and interest rates could increase, or our future access to the financial markets could be limited, as a result of risks and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, including: (i) the acceptance by credit markets of the structures and structural risks associated with our bank financing, private placement financing and asset-backed financing arrangements; (ii) the credit ratings provided by credit rating agencies for our asset-backed indebtedness; (iii) third parties requiring changes in the terms and structure of our asset-backed financing arrangements, including increased credit enhancements (such as lower advance rates) or required cash collateral and/or other liquid reserves; or (iv) changes in laws or regulations that negatively impact the terms on which the banks or other creditors may finance us or any of our asset-backed financing arrangements. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient additional financing on acceptable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, interest costs, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt outstanding on a consolidated basis and have significant debt service requirements. This increases the risk that adverse changes in our operating performance, our industry or the financial markets could severely diminish our financial performance and future business and growth prospects, and increases the chance that we might face insolvency due to a default on our debt obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding indebtedness of $3.2 billion under our asset backed securities, capital lease obligations and other debt facilities. Our interest and debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $118.3 million. As of December 31, 2015, our net debt (total debt plus equipment purchases payable less cash) to total revenue earning assets was 76%.\nOur substantial amount of debt could have important consequences for investors, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt facilities. Any failure to comply with such obligations, including a failure to make timely interest or principal payments, or a breach of financial or other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness, which could lead to, among other things, an acceleration of our indebtedness or foreclosure on the assets securing our indebtedness and which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, future prospects and solvency;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for operations, capital expenditures, future business opportunities and other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds, or to sell assets to raise funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes;\n\u2022\nmaking it difficult for us to pay dividends on our common shares or repurchase our common shares;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors having less debt.\nDespite our substantial leverage, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness. This could further exacerbate the risks described above.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although our asset backed securities and other credit facilities contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, such restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and, under certain circumstances, indebtedness incurred in compliance with such restrictions could be substantial. To the extent that new indebtedness is added to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 current debt levels, the risks described above would increase.\nWe will require a significant amount of cash to service and repay our outstanding indebtedness. This may limit our ability to fund future capital expenditures, pursue future business opportunities, make acquisitions or return cash to our shareholders.\nOur high level of indebtedness requires us to make large interest and principal payments. These debt service payments currently represent a significant portion of our cash flow, and if our operating cash flow decreases in the future, or if it becomes more difficult for us to arrange financing to refinance existing debt facilities or fund our new equipment purchases, we may be unable to service and repay our debt.\nAdditionally, TAL may not be able to refinance any of its indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying future capital expenditures or other business investments, which could have a material adverse impact on our growth rate, profitability and cash flow. Such actions, if necessary, may not be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our indebtedness will restrict our ability to sell assets and use the proceeds from such sales in certain ways.\nIf TAL is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or is otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal and interest on its indebtedness, or if it otherwise fails to comply with the various covenants in the instruments governing its indebtedness, it could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under TAL\u2019s debt facilities could elect to terminate their respective commitments thereunder, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against its assets, and it could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required lenders under our debt facilities to avoid being in default. If we breach our covenants under our debt facilities and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If this occurs, we would be in default under our debt facilities, the lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nOur asset backed securities, institutional notes, and other credit facilities impose significant operating and financial restrictions, which may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and taking certain actions.\nOur asset backed securities, institutional notes, and other credit facilities impose, and the terms of any future indebtedness may impose, significant operating, financial and other restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. These restrictions will limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends on or redeem or repurchase our shares;\n\u2022\nissue additional capital stock of TAL and our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nmake loans and investments;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets or merge with or into other companies;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with shareholders and affiliates;\n\u2022\ncause our subsidiaries to make dividends, distributions and other payments to TAL; and\n\u2022\notherwise conduct necessary corporate activities.\nThese restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs and pursue available business opportunities. A breach of any of these restrictions could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness. If a default occurs, the relevant lenders could elect to declare the indebtedness, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness, which will constitute substantially all of our material container assets.\nEnvironmental regulations may result in equipment obsolescence or require substantial investments to retrofit existing equipment, especially for our refrigerated containers. Additionally, environmental concerns are leading to significant design changes for new containers that have not been extensively tested, which increases the risks we face from potential technical problems.\nMany countries, including the United States, restrict, prohibit or otherwise regulate the use of chemical refrigerants due to their ozone depleting and global warming effects. Our refrigerated containers currently use R134A or 404A refrigerant. While R134A and 404A do not contain CFC\u2019s (which have been restricted since 1995), the European Union has instituted regulations beginning in 2011 to phase out the use of R134A in automobile air conditioning systems due to concern that the release of R134A into the atmosphere may contribute to global warming. While the European Union regulations do not currently restrict the use of R134A or 404A in refrigerated containers or trailers, it has been proposed that beginning in 2025 R134A and 404A usage in intermodal containers will be banned, although the final decision has not been made. Further, certain manufacturers of refrigerated containers, including the largest manufacturer of cooling machines for refrigerated containers, have begun testing units that utilize alternative refrigerants, such as carbon dioxide, that may have less global warming potential than R134A and 404A. If future regulations prohibit the use or servicing of containers using R134A or 404A refrigerants, we could be forced to incur large retrofitting expenses. In addition, refrigerated containers that are not retrofitted may become difficult to lease, command lower rental rates and disposal prices, or may have to be scrapped.\nAlso, the foam insulation in the walls of intermodal refrigerated containers requires the use of a blowing agent that contains hydrochlorofluorocarbons (CFC\u2019s, specifically HCFC-141b). Manufacturers are in various stages of phasing out the use of this blowing agent in the manufacturing process. In accordance with the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, the continued use of HCFC-141b in manufacturing is currently permitted. The European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) prohibits the import and the placing on the market in the EU of intermodal containers with insulation made with HCFC-141b (\u201cEU regulation\u201d). However, the European Commission has recognized that notwithstanding its regulation, under international conventions governing free movement of intermodal containers, the use of such intermodal refrigerated containers admitted into EU countries on temporary customs admission should be permitted. Each country in the EU has its own individual and different regulations to implement the EU regulation. TAL has procedures in place that we believe comply with the EU and country regulations. However, if such intermodal refrigerated containers exceed its temporary customs admission period and/or their custom admissions status changes (e.g., should such container be off-hired) and such intermodal refrigerated containers are deemed placed on the market in the EU, or if TAL\u2019s procedures are deemed not to comply with EU or a country\u2019s regulation, TAL could be subject to fines and penalties. Also, if future international conventions or regulations prohibit the use or servicing of containers with foam insulation that utilized this blowing agent during the manufacturing process, TAL could be forced to incur large retrofitting expenses and those containers that are not retrofitted may become more difficult to lease and command lower rental rates and disposal prices.\nAn additional environmental concern affecting our operations relates to the construction materials used in our dry containers. The floors of dry containers are plywood usually made from tropical hardwoods. Due to concerns regarding the de-forestation of tropical rain forests and climate change, many countries which have been the source of these hardwoods have implemented severe restrictions on the cutting and export of these woods. Accordingly, container manufacturers have switched\na significant portion of production to more readily available alternatives such as birch, bamboo, and other farm grown wood species. Container users are also evaluating alternative designs that would limit the amount of plywood required and are also considering possible synthetic materials to replace the plywood. These new woods or other alternatives have not proven their durability over the typical 13-15 year life of a dry container, and if they cannot perform as well as the hardwoods have historically, the future repair and operating costs for these containers could be significantly higher and the useful life of the containers may be decreased.\nLitigation to enforce our leases and recover our containers has inherent uncertainties that are increased by the location of our containers in jurisdictions that have less developed legal systems.\nWhile almost all of our lease agreements are governed by New York law and provide for the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the state of New York, our ability to enforce the lessees\u2019 obligations under the leases and other arrangements for use of the containers often is subject to applicable laws in the jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. It is not possible to predict, with any degree of certainty, the jurisdictions in which enforcement proceedings may be commenced. Our containers are manufactured primarily in China, and a substantial portion of our containers are leased out of Asia, primarily China, and are used by our customers in a wide range of global trades. Litigation and enforcement proceedings have inherent uncertainties in any jurisdiction and are expensive. These uncertainties are enhanced in countries that have less developed legal systems where the interpretation of laws and regulations is not consistent, may be influenced by factors other than legal merits and may be cumbersome, time-consuming and even more expensive. For example, repossession from defaulting lessees may be difficult and more expensive in jurisdictions whose laws do not confer the same security interests and rights to creditors and lessors as those in the United States and where the legal system is not as well developed. Additionally, even if we are successful in obtaining judgments against defaulting customers, these customers may have limited owned assets and/or heavily encumbered assets and the collection and enforcements of a monetary judgment against them may be unsuccessful. As a result, the remedies available and the relative success and expedience of collection and enforcement proceedings with respect to the containers in various jurisdictions cannot be predicted. As more of our business shifts to areas outside of the United States and Europe, such as China, it may become more difficult and expensive to enforce our rights and recover our containers.\nThe success of our recovery efforts for defaulted leases has been hampered by undeveloped creditor protections and legal systems in a number of countries. In these situations, we experienced an increase in average recovery costs per unit and a decrease in the percentage of containers recovered in default situations primarily due to excessive charges applied to our containers by the depot or terminal facilities that had been storing the containers for the defaulted lessee. In these cases, the payments demanded by the depot or terminal operators often significantly exceeded the amount of storage costs that we would reasonably expect to pay for the release of the containers. However, our legal remedies were limited in many of the jurisdictions where the containers were being stored, and we were sometimes forced to accept the excessive storage charges to gain control of our containers. If the number and size of defaults increases in the future, and if a large percentage of the defaulted containers are being stored in countries with less developed legal systems, losses resulting from recovery payments and unrecovered containers could be large and our profitability significantly reduced.\nWe may incur future asset impairment charges.\nAn asset impairment charge may result from the occurrence of unexpected adverse events or management decisions that impact our estimates of expected cash flows generated from our long-lived assets. We review our long-lived assets, including our container and chassis equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We may be required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future as a result of reductions in demand for specific container and chassis types, a weak economic environment, challenging market conditions, events related to particular customers or asset types, or as a result of asset or portfolio sale decisions by management.\nEffective October 1, 2012, we further increased the estimated residual values used in our depreciation calculations for several of our container types from the last increase made in the fourth quarter of 2010. If, in the future, we experience weak demand for these specific container types the amount of a potential impairment charge would be higher than if we had not increased our residual estimates.\nManufacturers of our equipment may be unwilling or unable to honor manufacturer warranties covering defects in our equipment.\nWe obtain warranties from the manufacturers of our equipment. When defects in the containers occur, we work with the manufacturers to identify and rectify the problem. However, there is no assurance that manufacturers will be willing or able to honor warranty obligations. If defects are discovered in containers that are not covered by manufacturer warranties we could be required to expend significant amounts of money to repair the containers, the useful lives of the containers could be shortened and the value of the containers reduced.\nFor example, there has been an increase in the number of premature failures of wood floors on our containers. A shortage of mature tropical hardwood has forced manufacturers to use younger and alternative species of wood to make container floors, and it is likely that the number and magnitude of warranty claims related to premature floor failure will increase. If container manufacturers do not honor warranties covering these failures, or if the failures occur after the warranty period expires, we could be required to expend significant amounts of money to repair or sell containers earlier than expected. This could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in market price or availability of containers in China could adversely affect our ability to maintain our supply of containers.\nChina is currently the largest container producing nation in the world, and we currently purchase substantially all of our dry containers, special containers and refrigerated containers from manufacturers based there. Currently, there are two manufacturers controlling a majority of the market. In the event that it were to become more expensive for us to procure containers in China because of further consolidation among container suppliers, a dispute with one of our manufacturers, increased tariffs imposed by the United States or other governments or for any other reason, we would have to seek alternative sources of supply. We may not be able to make alternative arrangements quickly enough to meet our equipment needs, and the alternative arrangements may increase our costs.\nWe may incur significant costs associated with relocation of leased equipment.\nWhen lessees return equipment to locations where supply exceeds demand, containers are routinely repositioned to higher demand areas. Positioning expenses vary depending on geographic location, distance, freight rates and other factors. Positioning expenses can be significant if a large portion of our containers are returned to locations with weak demand.\nWe currently seek to limit the number of containers that can be returned to areas where demand for such containers is not expected to be strong. However, future market conditions may not enable us to continue such practices. In addition, we may not be successful in accurately anticipating which port locations will be characterized by weak or strong demand in the future, and our current contracts will not provide much protection against positioning costs if ports that we expect to be strong demand ports turn out to be surplus container ports when the equipment is returned to such ports upon lease expiration. In particular, we could incur significant positioning costs in the future if trade flows change from net exports to net imports in locations such as the main ports in China that we currently consider to be high demand locations and where our leases typically allow large numbers of containers to be returned to us.\nSustained Asian economic, social or political instability could reduce demand for leasing.\nMany of the shipping lines to which we lease containers are entities domiciled in Asian countries. In addition, many of our customers are substantially dependent upon shipments of goods exported from Asia. From time to time, there have been economic disruptions, financial turmoil and political instability in this region. If these events were to occur in the future, they could adversely affect these customers and lead to reduced demand for leasing of our containers or otherwise adversely affect us.\nIt may become more expensive for us to store our off-hire containers.\nWe are dependent on third party depot operators to repair and store our equipment in port areas throughout the world. In many of these locations the land occupied by these depots is increasingly being considered as prime real estate. Accordingly, local communities are considering increasing restrictions on the depot operations which may increase their costs and in some cases force depots to relocate to sites further from the port areas. Additionally, depots in prime locations may become filled to capacity based on market conditions and may refuse additional containers due to space constraints. This could require us to enter into higher-cost storage agreements with third-party depot operators in order to accommodate our customers\u2019 turn-in\nrequirements and could result in increased costs and expenses for us. If these changes affect a large number of our depots it could significantly increase the cost of maintaining and storing our off-hire containers.\nWe rely on our information technology systems to conduct our business. If these systems fail to adequately perform their functions, or if we experience an interruption in their operation, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nThe efficient operation of our business is highly dependent on our information technology systems including our equipment tracking and billing system and our customer interface system. For example, these systems allow customers to place pick-up and drop-off orders on the Internet, view current inventory and check contractual terms in effect with respect to any given container lease agreement. We correspondingly rely on such information systems to track transactions, such as container pick-ups and drop-offs, repairs, and to bill our customers for the use and damage to our equipment. We also use the information provided by these systems in our day-to-day business in order to effectively manage our lease portfolio and improve customer service. The failure of these systems to perform as we anticipate could limit our ability to bill customers for the use of our containers, disrupt our business and cause our relationships with our customers to suffer. In addition, our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, power loss and computer systems failures and viruses. Any such interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise TAL\u2019s information technology systems and expose us to liability, which could cause its business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of its business, TAL will collect and store sensitive data on its systems and networks, including TAL\u2019s proprietary business information and that of its customers and suppliers, and personally identifiable information of its customers and employees. The secure storage, processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to TAL\u2019s operations. Despite the security measures it employs, TAL\u2019s information technology systems and networks may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise such systems and networks and the information stored therein could be accessed, publicly disclosed and/or lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disruption to its operations, damage to its reputation and/or loss of competitive position.\nTAL may not be able to protect its intellectual property rights, which could materially affect TAL\u2019s business.\nTAL\u2019s ability to obtain, protect and enforce its intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as the uncertainty as to the registrability, validity and enforceability of its intellectual property rights in each applicable country. TAL relies on its trademarks to distinguish its services from the services of competitors, and has registered or applied to register a number of these trademarks. However, TAL\u2019s trademark applications may not be approved. Third parties may also oppose TAL\u2019s trademark applications or otherwise challenge TAL\u2019s ownership or use of trademarks. In the event that TAL\u2019s trademarks are successfully challenged, TAL could be forced to rebrand its products, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require TAL to devote resources to advertising and marketing of these new brands. Additionally, from time to time, third parties adopt or use names similar to TAL\u2019s, thereby impeding TAL\u2019s ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to consumer confusion or to dilution of TAL\u2019s trademarks. TAL may not have sufficient resources or desire to defend or enforce its intellectual property rights, and even if TAL seeks to enforce them, there is no guarantee that it will be able to prevent such third-party uses. Furthermore, such enforcement efforts may be expensive, time consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention from managing TAL\u2019s business.\nTAL may be subject to claims by others that TAL is infringing on their intellectual property rights, which could harm TAL\u2019s business and negatively impact TAL\u2019s results of operations.\nThird parties may assert claims that TAL infringes their intellectual property rights and these claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming to litigate, cause TAL to incur substantial costs and divert management resources and attention in defending the claim. In some jurisdictions, plaintiffs can also seek injunctive relief that may prevent the marketing and selling of TAL\u2019s services that infringe on the plaintiff\u2019s intellectual property rights. To resolve these claims, TAL may enter into licensing agreements with restrictive terms or significant fees, stop selling or redesign affected services, or pay damages to satisfy contractual obligations to others. If TAL does not resolve these claims in advance of a trial, there is no guarantee that TAL will be successful in court. These outcomes may have a material adverse impact on TAL\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nA number of key personnel are critical to the success of our business.\nMost of our senior executives and other management level employees have been with us for over ten years and have significant industry experience. We rely on this knowledge and experience in our strategic planning and in our day-to-day business operations. Our success depends in large part upon our ability to retain our senior management, the loss of one or more of whom could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our success also depends on our ability to retain our experienced sales force and technical personnel as well as recruiting new skilled sales, marketing and technical personnel. Competition for experienced managers in our industry can be intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit, train or retain qualified personnel. If we fail to retain and recruit the necessary personnel, our business and our ability to retain customers and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer.\nThe international nature of the container industry exposes us to numerous risks.\nWe are subject to risks inherent in conducting business across national boundaries, any one of which could adversely impact our business. These risks include:\n\u2022\nregional or local economic downturns;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental policy or regulation;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of countries in which we operate;\n\u2022\ncompliance with U.S. Treasury sanctions regulations restricting doing business with certain nations or specially designated nationals;\n\u2022\nimport and export duties and quotas;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign customs and tariffs;\n\u2022\ninternational incidents;\n\u2022\nmilitary outbreaks;\n\u2022\ngovernment instability;\n\u2022\nnationalization of foreign assets;\n\u2022\ngovernment protectionism;\n\u2022\ncompliance with export controls, including those of the U.S. Department of Commerce;\n\u2022\ncompliance with import procedures and controls, including those of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security;\n\u2022\npotentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;\n\u2022\nrequirements relating to withholding taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nlabor or other disruptions at key ports;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in registering intellectual property or inadequate intellectual property protection in foreign jurisdictions; and\n\u2022\nrestrictions on our ability to own or operate subsidiaries, make investments or acquire new businesses in these jurisdictions.\nAny one or more of these factors could impair our current or future international operations and, as a result, harm our overall business.\nThe lack of an international title registry for containers increases the risk of ownership disputes.\nThere is no internationally recognized system of recordation or filing to evidence our title to containers nor is there an internationally recognized system for filing security interests in containers. Although this has not occurred to date, the lack of a title recordation system with respect to containers could result in disputes with lessees, end-users, or third parties who may improperly claim ownership of the containers.\nCertain liens may arise on our containers.\nDepot operators, repairmen and transporters may come into possession of our containers from time to time and have sums due to them from the lessees or sublessees of the containers. In the event of nonpayment of those charges by the lessees or sublessees, we may be delayed in, or entirely barred from, repossessing the containers, or be required to make payments or incur expenses to discharge such liens on the containers.\nChanges in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and affect TAL\u2019s reported operating results.\nGAAP is subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d), the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on TAL\u2019s reported results and may even affect TAL\u2019s reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may materially adversely affect TAL\u2019s reported financial results or the way in which TAL conducts its business.\nFor example, in May 2013, the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board issued an exposure draft on lease accounting that could significantly change the accounting and reporting for lease arrangements. The main objective of the proposed standard is to create a new accounting model for both customers and lessors, replacing the existing concepts of operating and capital leases with models based on \u201cright-of-use\u201d concepts. Some customers find leasing attractive because under current GAAP they are not required to include the value (and associated liabilities) of containers leased under operating leases on their balance sheets, thus improving certain financial metrics. If there are future changes in GAAP with regard to how TAL and its customers must account for leases, it could change the way TAL and its customers conduct their businesses, including eliminating for customers the financial statement benefit of entering into operating leases, which could have an adverse effect on TAL\u2019s business.\nIn addition, in May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update on a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that will supersede the existing revenue recognition guidance. The new accounting guidance creates a framework by which entities will allocate the transaction price to separate performance obligations and recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. Under the new standard, TAL will be required to use judgment and make estimates, including identifying performance obligations in a contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation and determining when performance obligations have been satisfied. The final revenue recognition standard is expected to take effect for TAL in 2017. See \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements -\u2009Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.\u201d\nBecause of TAL\u2019s significant international operations, it could be materially adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations.\nTAL operates on a global basis, with the vast majority of its revenue generated from leasing its containers to lessees for use in international trade. TAL is also dependent on third-party depot operators to repair and store its containers in port locations throughout the world. TAL\u2019s business operations are subject to anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), as well as the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010 (the \u201cU.K. Bribery Act\u201d). The FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries and agents from making improper payments to government officials or any other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. TAL\u2019s internal controls and procedures are designed to ensure that it complies with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, rules and regulations and helps mitigate and protect against corruption risks. Any determination of a violation or an investigation into violations of the FCPA or the U.K. Bribery Act or similar anticorruption and anti-bribery laws could have a material and adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA failure to comply with export control or economic sanctions laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on TAL\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition. TAL may be unable to ensure that its agents and/or customers comply with applicable sanctions and export control laws.\nTAL faces several risks inherent in conducting its business internationally, including compliance with applicable economic sanctions laws and regulations, such as laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d), the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Commerce. TAL must also comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations of the United States (including but not limited to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations) and other countries. Any determination of a violation or an investigation into violations of export controls or economic sanctions laws and regulations could result in significant criminal or civil fines, penalties or other sanctions and repercussions, including reputational harm that could materially affect TAL\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may incur increased costs associated with the implementation of new security regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to regulations promulgated in various countries, including the United States, seeking to protect the integrity of international commerce and prevent the use of containers for international terrorism or other illicit activities. For example, the Container Safety Initiative, the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism and Operation Safe Commerce are among the programs administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that are designed to enhance security for cargo moving throughout the international transportation system by identifying existing vulnerabilities in the supply chain and developing improved methods for ensuring the security of containerized cargo entering and leaving the United States. Moreover, the International Convention for Safe Containers, 1972 (CSC), as amended, adopted by the International Maritime Organization, applies to containers and seeks to maintain a high level of safety of human life in the transport and handling of containers by providing uniform international safety regulations. As these regulations develop and change, we may incur increased compliance costs due to the acquisition of new, compliant containers and/or the adaptation of existing containers to meet any new requirements imposed by such regulations. Additionally, certain companies are currently developing or may in the future develop products designed to enhance the security of containers transported in international commerce. Regardless of the existence of current or future government regulations mandating the safety standards of intermodal shipping containers, our competitors may adopt such products or our customers may require that we adopt such products in the conduct of our container leasing business. In responding to such market pressures, we may incur increased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTerrorist attacks could negatively impact our operations and our profitability and may expose us to liability and reputational damage.\nTerrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations and profitability. Such attacks have contributed to economic instability in the United States and elsewhere, and further acts of terrorism, violence or war could similarly affect world trade and the industries in which we and our customers operate. In addition, terrorist attacks or hostilities may directly impact ports our containers come in and out of, depots, our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers and could impact our sales and our supply chain. A severe disruption to the worldwide ports system and flow of goods could result in a reduction in the level of international trade and lower demand for our containers. The consequences of any terrorist attacks or hostilities are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nIt is also possible that one of our containers could be involved in a terrorist attack. Although our lease agreements require our lessees to indemnify us against all damages arising out of the use of our containers, and we carry insurance to potentially offset any costs in the event that our customer indemnifications prove to be insufficient, our insurance does not cover certain types of terrorist attacks, and we may not be fully protected from liability or the reputational damage that could arise from a terrorist attack which utilizes one of our containers.\nEnvironmental liability may adversely affect our business and financial situation.\nWe are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants to air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury, as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations in connection with our current or historical operations. Under some environmental laws in the United States and certain other countries, the owner of a leased container may be liable for environmental damage, cleanup or other costs in the event of a spill or discharge of material from a container without regard to the owner\u2019s fault. We have not yet experienced any\nsuch claims, although we cannot assure that we will not be subject to such claims in the future. Liability insurance policies, including ours, usually exclude claims for environmental damage. Some of our lessees may have separate insurance coverage for environmental damage, but we cannot assure that any such policies would cover or otherwise offset any liability we may have as the owner of a leased container. Our standard master tank container lease agreement insurance clause requires our tank container lessees to provide pollution liability insurance. In addition, TAL will typically require its customers to provide it with indemnity against certain losses; however, such insurance or indemnities may not fully protect us against damages arising from environmental damage.\nAdverse changes in U.S. tax rules or a reduction in our level of continuing investment in the U. S. could negatively impact our income tax provision or future cash tax payments.\nWhile we record a tax provision in our financial statements, we currently do not pay any meaningful income taxes primarily due to the benefit we receive from accelerated tax depreciation on our container investments. A change in the rules governing the tax depreciation for our containers, in particular, a change that increases the period over which we can depreciate our containers for tax purposes, could reduce or eliminate this tax benefit and significantly increase our cash tax payments.\nIn addition, even under current tax rules, we need to make substantial, ongoing investments in new containers in order to continue to benefit from the tax deferral generated by accelerated tax depreciation. If our investment level slows due to a decrease in the growth rate of world trade, decisions by our customers to buy more of their containers, a loss of market share to one or more of our peers, or for any other reason, the favorable tax treatment from accelerated tax depreciation would diminish, and we could face significantly increased cash tax payments.\nAlso, our net deferred tax liability balance includes a deferred tax asset for U.S. federal and various states resulting from net operating loss carryforwards. A reduction to our future earnings, which will lower taxable income, may require us to record a charge against earnings in the form of a valuation allowance, if it is determined that it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the loss carryforwards will not be realized.\nFluctuations in foreign exchange rates could reduce our profitability.\nThe majority of our revenues and costs are billed in U.S. dollars. Most of our non-U.S. dollar transactions are individually of small amounts and in various denominations and thus are not suitable for cost-effective hedging. In addition, almost all of our container purchases are paid for in U.S. dollars.\nOur operations and used container sales in locations outside of the U.S. have some exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, and trade growth and the direction of trade flows can be influenced by large changes in relative currency values. Adverse or large exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nMost of our equipment fleet is manufactured in China. Although the purchase price is in U.S. dollars, our manufacturers pay labor and other costs in the local currency, the Chinese Yuan. To the extent that our manufacturers\u2019 costs increase due to changes in the valuation of the Chinese Yuan, the dollar price we pay for equipment could be affected.\nTAL\u2019s operations could be affected by natural or man-made events in the locations in which TAL or its customers or suppliers operate.\nTAL will have operations in locations subject to severe weather conditions, natural disasters, the outbreak of contagious disease, or man-made incidents such as chemical explosions, any of which could disrupt its operations. In addition, its suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations. For example, in 2011, the northern region of Japan experienced a severe earthquake followed by a series of tsunamis resulting in material damage to the Japanese economy. In 2015, a chemical explosion and fire in the port of Tianjin, China damaged or destroyed a small number of TAL\u2019s containers and disrupted operations in the port. Similarly, outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases, such as H1N1 (swine) flu and the Ebola virus, could significantly reduce the demand for international shipping or could prevent its containers from being discharged in the affected areas or in other locations after having visited the affected areas. Any future natural or man-made disasters or health concerns in the world where TAL has business operations could lead to disruption of the regional and global economies, which could result in a decrease in demand for leased containers.\nIncreases in the cost of or the lack of availability of insurance could increase our risk exposure and reduce our profitability.\nOur lessees and depots are required to maintain all risks physical damage insurance, comprehensive general liability insurance and to indemnify us against loss. We also maintain our own contingent liability insurance and off-hire physical\ndamage insurance. Nevertheless, lessees\u2019 and depots\u2019 insurance or indemnities and our insurance may not fully protect us. The cost of such insurance may increase or become prohibitively expensive for us and our customers and such insurance may not continue to be available.\nWe also maintain director and officer liability insurance. Potential new accounting standards and new corporate governance regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain increased levels of coverage or it may not continue to be available.\nWe currently maintain credit insurance that in certain circumstances covers losses and costs incurred due to defaults by our lessees. However, this insurance has significant deductibles, exclusions, payment and other limitations, and therefore may not protect us from losses arising from customer defaults. We typically need to renew these insurance policies on an annual basis, and the cost of such insurance may increase or become prohibitively expensive for us and our customers and such insurance may not continue to be available.\nLabor activism and unrest, or failure to maintain satisfactory labor relations, could adversely affect TAL\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLabor activism and unrest could materially adversely affect TAL\u2019s operations and thereby materially adversely affect its financial condition and prospects. TAL may experience labor unrest, activism, disputes or actions in the future, some of which may be significant and could materially adversely affect TAL\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe price of our common stock may be highly volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nThe trading price of our common shares is likely to be subject to wide fluctuations. Factors affecting the trading price of our common shares may include:\n\u2022\nvariations in our financial results;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s response to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance or interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of common shares by us and our directors, officers and significant shareholders;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations or enhanced or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nour failure to achieve operating results consistent with securities analysts\u2019 projections;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in our dividend policy and share repurchase programs;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the worldwide equity markets;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nour failure to timely address changing customer preferences;\n\u2022\nbroad market and industry factors; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to such events.\nIn addition, if the market for intermodal equipment leasing company stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common shares could decline for reasons unrelated to our business or\nfinancial results. The trading price of our common shares might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our shares, the price of our common shares could decline.\nThe trading market for our common shares relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business or our industry. We have no influence or control over these analysts. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrades our stock, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur failure to comply with required public company corporate governance and financial reporting practices and regulations could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, operating results and the price of our common shares. Further, our internal controls over financial reporting may not detect all errors or omissions in the financial statements.\nWe are subject to meet the regulatory compliance and reporting requirements applicable to us as a public company, including those issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange. Failure to meeting these requirements may lead to adverse regulatory consequences, and could lead to a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. If we fail to maintain effective controls and procedures, we may be unable to provide the required financial information in a timely and reliable manner or otherwise comply with the standards applicable to us as a public company. Any failure by us to timely provide the required financial information could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and the market value of our common shares. Furthermore, testing and maintaining internal controls can divert our management\u2019s attention from other matters that are important to our business.\nThe Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) requires that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. If we do not maintain compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, we could suffer a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our shares to decline. We can also be subject to sanctions or investigations by the New York Stock Exchange, the Securities and Exchange Commission or other regulatory authorities for failure to comply with public company corporate governance and financial reporting practices and regulations.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act requires an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of internal controls over financial accounting, we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act and related regulations. Although our management has concluded that adequate internal control procedures are currently in place, no system of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that the financial statements are accurate and free of material errors. As a result, the risk exists that our internal controls may not detect all errors or omissions in the financial statements.\nChanges in laws and regulations could adversely affect TAL\u2019s business.\nAll aspects of TAL\u2019s business, including leasing, pricing, sales, litigation and intellectual property rights, will be subject to extensive legislation and regulation. Changes in applicable federal and state laws and agency regulations, as well as the laws and regulations of foreign jurisdictions, could have a material adverse effect on TAL\u2019s businesses.\nWe may decide to pursue acquisitions and joint ventures that may present unforeseen integration obstacles or costs.\nWe may selectively pursue acquisitions and joint ventures, which could involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:\n\u2022\ndilution of shareholders\u2019 ownership interest of TAL if new shares are issued to fund an acquisition;\n\u2022\npotential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u2022\ndifficulty with integration of personnel and financial and other systems;\n\u2022\nhiring additional management and other critical personnel; and\n\u2022\nincreasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations.\nIn addition, we may encounter unforeseen obstacles or costs in the integration of acquired businesses. Also, the presence of one or more material liabilities of an acquired company that are unknown to us at the time of acquisition may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our acquisition and joint venture strategy may not be successfully received by customers, and we may not realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures.\nRisk Factors Relating to the Proposed Mergers involving TAL and Triton Container International Limited (\u201cTriton\u201d) forming Triton International Limited (\u201cHoldco\u201d)\nOn November 9, 2015, TAL and Triton Container International Limited (\u201cTriton\u201d) announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which the companies will combine in an all-stock merger. Under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, upon the closing of the transaction, TAL and Triton will be merged with subsidiaries of a newly-formed holding company Triton International Limited (\u201cHoldco\u201d), which will be domiciled in Bermuda and is expected to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. TAL shareholders will receive one common share of Triton International for each share of TAL stock owned. TAL shareholders are expected to receive a special dividend of $0.54 per share upon closing of the transaction, assuming the transaction closes in the second quarter of 2016. The transaction is subject to the approval of TAL\u2019s shareholders. A special meeting of TAL shareholders is anticipated to be held in the second quarter of 2016.\nTAL shareholders cannot be sure of the market value of the Holdco common shares to be issued upon completion of the mergers.\nTAL shareholders will receive a fixed number of Holdco common shares in the mergers rather than a number of shares with a particular fixed market value. The market value of TAL common stock at the time of the mergers may vary significantly from its price on the date the Transaction Agreement was executed, the date that the proxy statement/prospectus for TAL shareholders relating to the transaction is declared effective by the SEC, the date hereof, or the date on which TAL shareholders vote on the adoption of the Transaction Agreement. Because the TAL exchange ratio will not be adjusted to reflect any changes in the market price of TAL common stock, the market value of the Holdco common shares issued in the mergers and the TAL common stock surrendered in the mergers may be higher or lower than the values of these shares on earlier dates. One hundred percent (100%) of the TAL merger consideration to be received by TAL shareholders will be Holdco common shares.\nChanges in the market prices of TAL, and after the completion of the proposed mergers, Holdco common stock, may result from a variety of factors that are beyond the control of TAL, including changes in its business, operations and prospects, regulatory considerations, governmental actions, and legal proceedings and developments. Market assessments of the benefits of the mergers, the likelihood that the mergers will be completed, and general and industry-specific market and economic conditions might also have an effect on the market price of TAL and Holdco common stock. Changes in the market price of TAL and Holdco common stock might also be caused by fluctuations and developments affecting domestic and global securities markets.\nThe market value of TAL common stock may vary significantly from its price on the date the Transaction Agreement was executed and from the date of this Form 10-K to the date of the completion of the mergers. TAL shareholders are urged to obtain up-to-date prices for the TAL common stock. There is no assurance that the mergers will be completed, that there will not be a delay in the completion of the mergers or that all or any of the anticipated benefits of the mergers will be realized.\nAdditionally, there is no assurance that Holdco will be able to pay its previously planned annual dividend of $1.80 per share or its previously planned repurchase of $250 million of its common shares following the consummation of the mergers, particularly if difficult industry conditions continue. See Holdco\u2019s Form S-4/A sections titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Triton - Industry Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations,\u201d \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Triton\u2009-\u2009Utilization\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Triton\u2009-\u2009Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d, filed with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nActions taken under the antitrust laws may prevent or delay completion of the mergers or reduce the anticipated benefits of the mergers or may require changes to the structure or terms of the mergers.\nAt any time before or after the mergers are consummated, notwithstanding the early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act (\u201cHSR Act\u201d), the receipt of approvals from the German Federal Cartel Office (\u201cFCO\u201d) and the Korean Fair Trade Commission (\u201cKFTC\u201d), any of the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d), the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) or U.S. state attorneys general could take action under the antitrust laws in opposition to the mergers, including seeking to enjoin completion of the mergers, condition completion of the mergers upon the divestiture of assets of Triton, TAL or their subsidiaries or impose restrictions on Holdco\u2019s post-merger operations. These could negatively affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of the combined company following completion of the mergers. Any such requirements or restrictions may prevent or delay completion of the mergers or may reduce the anticipated benefits of the mergers, which could also have a material adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, TAL and Triton have agreed to take certain actions, conditioned on the closing, and may take other actions that TAL or Triton determines in its sole discretion to take, to the extent necessary to ensure satisfaction, on or prior to the end date, of certain conditions to the closing of the mergers relating to regulatory approvals. Certain of these actions may be taken after receipt of the approval of the shareholders of TAL and it is not currently contemplated that any such shareholder approval would be re-solicited in the event that any of these actions are taken after the TAL special meeting.\nFailure to successfully combine the businesses of TAL and Triton in the expected time frame may adversely affect Holdco\u2019s future results.\nThe success of the mergers will depend, in part, on Holdco\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the businesses of TAL and Triton as further described in Holdco\u2019s Form S-4/A in the section titled \u201cthe Mergers- TAL\u2019s Reasons for the Mergers\u201d, filed with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission. To realize these anticipated benefits, the businesses of TAL and Triton must be successfully combined. Historically, TAL and Triton have been independent companies, and they will continue to be operated as such until the completion of the mergers. The management of Holdco may face significant challenges in consolidating the functions of TAL and Triton, integrating their respective technologies, organizations, procedures, policies and operations, retaining key personnel, as well as addressing the different business cultures at the two companies. If the combined company is not successfully integrated, the anticipated benefits of the mergers may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. The integration may also be complex and time consuming, and require substantial resources and effort. The integration process and other disruptions resulting from the mergers may also disrupt each company\u2019s ongoing businesses and/or adversely affect TAL\u2019s or Triton\u2019s relationships with employees, regulators and others with whom they have business or other dealings.\nTAL and Triton will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the mergers are pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the mergers on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on TAL or Triton and consequently on the combined company. These uncertainties may impair TAL\u2019s or Triton\u2019s ability to retain and motivate key personnel and could cause customers and others that deal with TAL or Triton to defer entering into contracts with TAL or Triton or making other decisions concerning TAL or Triton or seek to change existing business relationships with TAL or Triton. In addition, if key employees depart because of uncertainty about their future roles and the potential complexities of the mergers, TAL\u2019s and Triton\u2019s businesses could be harmed. In addition, the Transaction Agreement restricts TAL and Triton from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions until the mergers occur without the consent of the other party. These restrictions may prevent TAL and Triton from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the mergers. See Holdco\u2019s Form S-4/A in the section titled \u201cThe Transaction Agreement - Covenants and Agreements\u201d filed with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a description of the restrictive covenants applicable to TAL and Triton.\nThe Transaction Agreement limits TAL\u2019s and Triton\u2019s ability to pursue alternatives to the mergers.\nEach of TAL and Triton has agreed that it will not solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or facilitate inquiries or proposals or engage in discussions or negotiations regarding takeover proposals, subject to limited exceptions, including that each of TAL and Triton may, in certain circumstances, take certain actions in the event TAL receives an unsolicited takeover proposal that constitutes a superior proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal. Each party has also agreed that its Board of Directors will not change its recommendation to its shareholders or approve any alternative agreement, subject to limited exceptions, including that, at any time prior to the TAL shareholder approval, the TAL Board may make a change in recommendation: (i) in circumstances not involving or relating to a takeover proposal, if the TAL Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the exercise of its fiduciary duties to its shareholders under applicable laws; or (ii) in response to a TAL\nSuperior Proposal (as defined in the Transaction Agreement), if the TAL Board concludes that a failure to change its recommendation would be inconsistent with the exercise of its fiduciary duties to its shareholders under applicable law and, if requested by the other party, its representatives have negotiated in good faith with the other party regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreement proposed by the other party in response to such TAL Superior Proposal. Additionally, the Transaction Agreement provides that under specified circumstances, if the TAL Board determines that a TAL Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the Transaction Agreement) from a TAL Bidder could reasonably be expected to lead to a TAL Superior Proposal and engages in discussions with such TAL Bidder, the TAL shareholders meeting has not occurred, the Triton Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that a Triton Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the Transaction Agreement) constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Triton Superior Proposal (as defined in the Transaction Agreement) and, prior to providing any confidential information, Triton has entered into an Acceptable Triton Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in the Transaction Agreement), then Triton and its Board may engage in discussions or provide any confidential information in response to an unsolicited written Triton Acquisition Proposal. The Transaction Agreement also requires TAL to call, give notice of and hold a meeting of its shareholders for the purpose of obtaining the applicable shareholder approval. This special meeting requirement does not apply to TAL in the event that the Transaction Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. See Holdco\u2019s Form S-4/A in the section titled \u201cThe Transaction Agreement\u2009-\u2009Covenants and Agreements\u2009-\u2009Shareholders Meetings and Duty to Recommend\u201d as filed with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, under specified circumstances, TAL may be required to pay a termination fee of $19,484,275 if the mergers are not consummated. See Holdco\u2019s Form S-4/A in the section titled \u201cThe Transaction Agreement\u2009-\u2009Termination Fees; Expenses\u201d as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a description of the circumstances under which such termination fee is payable. Furthermore, upon adoption of the transaction agreement by the TAL shareholders at the TAL special meeting, the right of TAL to terminate the Transaction Agreement in response to a TAL Superior Proposal will terminate. These provisions might discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of TAL from considering or proposing an acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher price per share than that proposed in the mergers, or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower price per share to acquire TAL than it might otherwise have been willing to pay.\nCertain directors and executive officers of TAL may have interests in the mergers that are different from, or in addition to or in conflict with, TAL shareholders.\nExecutive officers of TAL negotiated the terms of the Transaction Agreement and the TAL Board approved the Transaction Agreement and unanimously recommends that TAL shareholders vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Transaction Agreement. These directors and executive officers may have interests in the mergers that are different from, or in addition to or in conflict with, those of TAL shareholders. These interests include the continued employment of certain executive officers of TAL by Holdco, the continued positions of certain directors of TAL as directors of Holdco, and the indemnification of former TAL directors and TAL officers by Holdco and the surviving corporations. With respect to TAL executive officers, these interests also include the treatment in the TAL merger of restricted TAL shares held by executive officers and their participation in TAL\u2019s executive severance and executive retention bonus plans. For a discussion of the interests of directors and executive officers in the mergers, see Holdco\u2019s Form S-4/A in the section titled \u201cThe Mergers\u2009-\u2009Interests of TAL Officers and Directors in the Mergers\u201d as filed with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe Holdco common shares to be received by TAL shareholders as a result of the mergers will have different rights from shares of TAL common stock.\nFollowing completion of the mergers, TAL shareholders will no longer be shareholders of TAL, but will instead become shareholders of Holdco. There will be important differences between the current rights of TAL shareholders and the rights of Holdco shareholders. See Holdco\u2019s Form S-4/A in the section titled \u201cComparison of Shareholder Rights\u201d as filed with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a discussion of the different rights associated with Holdco common shares and TAL common stock.\nTAL shareholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the mergers and will exercise less influence over management.\nAfter the completion of the mergers, the TAL shareholders will own a smaller percentage of Holdco than they currently own of TAL. Upon completion of the mergers, it is anticipated that former Triton shareholders will hold approximately 55% and former TAL shareholders will hold approximately 45% of the shares of common stock of Holdco issued and outstanding immediately after the consummation of the mergers. Consequently, TAL shareholders, as a group, will have reduced ownership and voting power in the combined company compared to their ownership and voting power in TAL. In particular, TAL shareholders, as a group, will have less than a majority of the ownership and voting power of Holdco and, therefore, will be\nable to exercise less collective influence over the management and policies of Holdco than they currently exercise over the management and policies of TAL. Additionally, significant Triton shareholders will hold significant ownership stakes in Holdco and could, subject to the terms of the Sponsor Shareholders\u2019 Agreements (as defined in the Transaction Agreement) with Holdco, have influence over the combined company.\nFailure to complete the mergers could negatively impact the stock price, businesses and financial results of TAL.\nIf the mergers are not completed, the ongoing business of TAL may be adversely affected and TAL will be subject to several risks and consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nTAL may be required, under certain specified circumstances, to pay Triton a termination fee of $19,484,275 or to reimburse the documented, out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses incurred by Triton, Holdco, the Merger Subs and their subsidiaries in connection with the Transaction Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (up to $3,500,000);\n\u2022\nunder the Transaction Agreement, TAL is subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business prior to completing the mergers which may adversely affect its ability to execute certain of its business strategies; and\n\u2022\nmatters relating to the mergers may require substantial commitments of time and resources by TAL management, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to TAL as an independent company.\nIn addition, if the mergers are not completed, TAL may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from its customers and employees. TAL also could be subject to litigation related to a failure to complete the mergers or to enforce its obligations under the Transaction Agreement. If the mergers are not consummated, TAL cannot assure its shareholders that the risks described will not materially affect the business, financial results and stock price of TAL.\nTAL and Triton will incur significant transaction and merger-related transition costs in connection with the mergers.\nTAL and Triton expect that they will incur significant, non-recurring costs in the range of $95 million to $110 million in connection with consummating the mergers and integrating the operations of both companies. These expected costs include:\n\u2022\nan estimated $30 million to $40 million in severance costs;\n\u2022\napproximately $35 million of costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key employees of which approximately $25 million is related to a retention plan established in connection with the acquisition of Triton in 2011 by Warburg Pincus and Vestar. As of September 30, 2015, $18.2 million related to the Triton 2011 retention plan has been accrued in Triton\u2019s financial statements; and\n\u2022\nan estimated $30 million to $35 million of fees and expenses relating to legal, accounting and other transaction and advisory fees associated with the mergers.\nSome of these costs are payable regardless of whether the mergers are completed. Moreover, under certain specified circumstances, TAL may be required to pay a termination fee of\u2009$19,484,275 if the mergers are not consummated or to reimburse certain fees, costs and expenses incurred by Triton, Holdco, the Merger Subs and their subsidiaries in connection with the Transaction Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (up to $3,500,000). See Holdco\u2019s Form S-4/A in the section titled \u201cThe Transaction Agreement - Termination Fees; Expenses\u201d as filed with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe unaudited pro forma combined financial information may not be indicative of what Holdco\u2019s actual financial position or results of operations would have been.\nThe unaudited pro forma combined financial information (which was included in Holdco\u2019s Form S-4/A filed with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission) is not necessarily indicative of what Holdco\u2019s actual financial position or results of operations would have been had the mergers been completed on the dates indicated, nor is it indicative of the present operating results of TAL or Triton or the future operating results or financial position of Holdco. The actual financial condition and results of operations of Holdco following the mergers may not be consistent with, or evident from, these pro forma financial statements. In addition, the assumptions used in preparing the pro forma financial statements may not prove to be accurate, and\nother factors may affect Holdco\u2019s financial condition or results of operations following the mergers. Any potential decline in Holdco\u2019s financial condition or results of operations may cause significant variations in the share price of Holdco. See Holdco\u2019s Form S-4/A in the section titled \u201cUnaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information\u201d as filed with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission for more information.\nTAL, Triton and, subsequently, the combined company must continue to retain, motivate and recruit executives and other key employees, which may be difficult in light of uncertainty regarding the mergers, and failure to do so could negatively affect the combined company.\nFor the mergers to be successful, during the period before the mergers are completed, both TAL and Triton must continue to retain, motivate and recruit executives and other key employees. Moreover, the combined company must be successful at retaining and motivating key employees following the completion of the mergers. Experienced employees in the industries in which TAL and Triton operate are in high demand and competition for their talents can be intense. Employees of both TAL and Triton may experience uncertainty about their future role with the combined company until, or even after, strategies with regard to the combined company are announced or executed. The potential distractions of the mergers may adversely affect the ability of TAL, Triton or, following completion of the mergers, the combined company, to retain, motivate and recruit executives and other key employees and keep them focused on applicable strategies and goals. A failure by TAL, Triton or, following the completion of the mergers, the combined company, to attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees during the period prior to or after the completion of the mergers could have a negative impact on the business of TAL, Triton or the combined company.\nIf the mergers are not completed, TAL\u2019s common stock could be materially adversely affected.\nThe mergers are subject to customary conditions to closing, including the approval of TAL\u2019s shareholders. In addition, TAL and Triton may terminate the Transaction Agreement under certain circumstances. If TAL and Triton do not complete the mergers, the market price of TAL\u2019s common stock may fluctuate to the extent that the current market price of those shares reflects a market assumption that the mergers will be completed. Further, whether or not the mergers are completed, TAL and Triton will also be obligated to pay certain investment banking, legal and accounting fees and related expenses in connection with the mergers, which could negatively impact results of operations when incurred. If the mergers are not completed, TAL cannot assure its shareholders that additional risks will not materialize or not materially adversely affect the business, results of operations and stock price.\nThe termination fee contained in the Transaction Agreement may discourage other companies from trying to acquire TAL.\nTAL has agreed to pay a termination fee of\u2009$19,484,275 to Triton if, under certain circumstances, the Transaction Agreement is terminated and a competing offer is accepted by TAL. This fee could discourage other companies from trying to acquire TAL.\nThe opinion rendered by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated to the TAL Board will not reflect changes in circumstances between signing the Transaction Agreement and the closing of the mergers.\nMerrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (\u201cBofA Merrill Lynch\u201d) rendered an opinion to the TAL Board, dated November 9, 2015, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and limitations and qualifications described in the written opinion, the TAL exchange ratio (taking into account the Triton merger) was fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of TAL common stock. The BofA Merrill Lynch opinion does not speak as of the time the mergers will be completed or as of any date other than the date of such opinion. Because the TAL Board does not anticipate asking BofA Merrill Lynch to update its opinion, the TAL Board will not receive an opinion to the fairness from a financial point of view of the TAL exchange ratio (taking into account the Triton Merger) to TAL as of any time other than November 9, 2015. Subsequent changes in the operations and prospects of TAL or Triton, general market and economic conditions and other factors (including the continued deterioration of market conditions in the container leasing industry), on which the BofA Merrill Lynch opinion was in part based, may significantly alter the value of TAL or Triton, the market price of shares of TAL\u2019s common stock or the relative value of TAL and Triton by the time the mergers are completed. See Holdco\u2019s Form S-4/A in the section titled \u201cThe Mergers\u2009-\u2009Opinion of TAL\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d as filed with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nRisk Factors Relating to Holdco after Completion of the Mergers\nAll related \"Risk Factors related to TAL\" discussed above are also included in the Risk Factors related to Holdco after the completion of the mergers.\nHoldco may be unable to successfully integrate Triton\u2019s and TAL\u2019s operations.\nThe merger involves the integration of two companies that previously operated independently. The difficulties of combining the companies\u2019 operations include integrating personnel, departments, systems, operating procedures, office infrastructures and information technologies and retaining key employees. Failures in integrating operations or the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of the combined company. For example, the failure to properly transfer data and information to the selected information systems from the discontinued information systems or the failure of the systems to handle the additional data and larger volume of transactions or to perform as anticipated could limit our ability to bill customers for the use of our containers, disrupt our business and cause our relationships with customers to suffer.\nHoldco\u2019s relatively greater size may make it more difficult for Holdco to sell its used containers.\nHoldco\u2019s relatively greater size in the container leasing industry may result in purchasers of used intermodal containers shifting their business to other potential sellers of used containers as such purchasers seek to diversify the parties from which they effect such purchases or placing additional competitive pressure on the price at which Holdco is able to sell its used containers, particularly when the market environment for sales of used containers is weak, each of which could result in a material decrease in the used container disposition proceeds that Holdco realizes relative to the historical used container disposition proceeds realized by TAL and Triton.\nIncreases in the cost of or the lack of availability of insurance could increase Holdco's risk exposure and reduce its profitability.\nHoldco will obtain director and officer liability insurance at the time of the closing of the mergers. Potential new accounting standards and new corporate governance regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for Holdco to obtain director and officer liability insurance, or it may not continue to be available.\nTAL and Triton currently maintain credit insurance that in certain circumstances covers losses and costs incurred due to defaults by their lessees. This insurance, unless its terms are modified, will terminate upon the closing of the mergers and new insurance policies will have to be obtained. The cost of such insurance may increase or become prohibitively expensive for TAL Triton and Holdco and such insurance may not continue to be available.\nU.S. investors in Holdco could suffer adverse tax consequences if Holdco is characterized as a passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nBased upon the nature of Holdco\u2019s business activities, Holdco may be classified as a passive foreign investment company (\u201cPFIC\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such characterization could result in adverse U.S. tax consequences to direct or indirect U.S. investors in Holdco common shares. For example, if Holdco is a PFIC, Holdco\u2019s U.S. investors could become subject to increased tax liabilities under U.S. tax laws and regulations and could become subject to burdensome reporting requirements. The determination of whether or not Holdco is a PFIC is made on an annual basis and depends on the composition of Holdco\u2019s income and assets from time to time. Specifically, for any taxable year, Holdco will be classified as a PFIC for U.S. tax purposes if either:\n\u2022\n75% or more of Holdco\u2019s gross income in a taxable year is passive income; or\n\u2022\nthe average percentage of Holdco\u2019s assets (which includes cash) by value in a taxable year which produce or are held for the production of passive income is at least 50%.\nIn applying these tests, Holdco is treated as owning or generating directly Holdco\u2019s pro rata share of the assets and income of any corporation in which Holdco owns at least 25% by value. If you are a U.S. holder and Holdco is a PFIC for any taxable year during which you own Holdco common shares, you could be subject to adverse U.S. tax consequences. In such a case, under the PFIC rules, unless a U.S. holder is permitted to and does elect otherwise under the Code, such U.S. holder would be subject to special tax rules with respect to excess distributions and any gain from the disposition of Holdco common shares. In\nparticular, the excess distribution or gain will be treated as if it had been recognized ratably over the holder\u2019s holding period for Holdco common shares, and amounts allocated to prior years starting with the first taxable year of Holdco during which Holdco was a PFIC will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the highest prevailing tax rates on ordinary income for that year plus an interest charge.\nBased on the expected composition of Holdco\u2019s income, valuation of Holdco\u2019s assets and Holdco\u2019s election to treat certain of Holdco\u2019s subsidiaries as disregarded entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Holdco does not expect that it should be treated as a PFIC for Holdco\u2019s current taxable year or for the foreseeable future. However, because the PFIC determination in Holdco\u2019s case is made by taking into account all of the relevant facts and circumstances regarding Holdco\u2019s business without the benefit of clearly defined bright line rules, it is possible that Holdco may be a PFIC for any taxable year or that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) may challenge Holdco\u2019s determination concerning its PFIC status.\nHoldco may become subject to unanticipated tax liabilities that may have a material adverse effect on Holdco\u2019s results of operations.\nHoldco is a Bermuda company, and Holdco believes that the income derived from Holdco\u2019s operations will not be subject to tax in Bermuda, which currently has no corporate income tax. Holdco further believes that a significant portion of the income derived from Holdco\u2019s operations will not be subject to tax in many other countries in which Holdco conducts activities or in which Holdco\u2019s customers or containers are located. However, this belief is based on the anticipated nature and conduct of Holdco\u2019s business, which may change. It is also based on Holdco\u2019s understanding of the tax laws of the countries in which Holdco conducts activities or in which Holdco\u2019s customers that use Holdco\u2019s containers are resident. The tax positions Holdco takes in various jurisdictions are subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law that may have retroactive effect.\nHoldco\u2019s results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if Holdco becomes subject to a significant amount of unanticipated tax liabilities.\nThe calculation of Holdco\u2019s income tax expense requires significant judgment and the use of estimates.\nHoldco will periodically assess its tax positions based on current tax developments, including enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance. In analyzing Holdco\u2019s overall tax position, consideration will be given to the amount and timing of recognizing income tax liabilities and benefits. In applying the tax and accounting guidance to the facts and circumstances, income tax balances are adjusted as Holdco considers appropriate through the income tax provision. Holdco accounts for income tax positions on uncertainties by recognizing the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained, and maintains reserves for income tax positions it believes are not more-likely-than-not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. However, due to the significant judgment required in estimating those reserves, actual amounts paid, if any, could differ significantly from those estimates.\nConcentration of ownership among Holdco\u2019s Sponsor Shareholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest.\nFollowing the completion of this offering, the Sponsor Shareholders will own approximately 42% of Holdco\u2019s outstanding common shares. Warburg Pincus will own approximately 27% of Holdco\u2019s common shares; Vestar will own approximately 15% of Holdco\u2019s common shares. Under the Sponsor Shareholders Agreements, following the closing of the mergers, Warburg Pincus will have the ongoing right to designate two individuals to serve on the Holdco Board, and Vestar will have the ongoing right to designate one individual to serve on the Holdco Board, in each case subject to the approval by the Holdco Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of any individuals so designated. The rights of Warburg Pincus and Vestar to designate individuals to serve on the Holdco Board are subject to reduction as their respective ownership of Holdco common shares declines. The Sponsor Shareholders Agreements provide certain restrictions on the Sponsor Shareholders. However, the concentration of influence in the Sponsor Shareholders may delay, deter or prevent acts that would be favored by Holdco\u2019s other shareholders, who may have interests different from those of Holdco\u2019s Sponsor Shareholders. For example, Holdco\u2019s Sponsor Shareholders could delay or prevent an acquisition, merger or amalgamation deemed beneficial to other shareholders, or cause, or seek to cause, Holdco to take courses of action that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment in Holdco, but which might involve risks to Holdco\u2019s other shareholders or adversely affect Holdco or Holdco\u2019s other shareholders. Holdco\u2019s Sponsor Shareholders may be able to cause or prevent a change in control of Holdco or a change in the composition of the Holdco Board and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of Holdco. This may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control. In addition, this significant concentration of share ownership may materially adversely affect\nthe trading price of Holdco\u2019s common shares because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning common shares in companies with significant concentrations of ownership.\nFurther, the Holdco bye-laws provide that Holdco, on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries, renounces any interest or expectancy it or its subsidiaries may have in (or in being offered an opportunity to participate in) business opportunities that are from time to time presented to any of Warburg Pincus or Vestar and their respective affiliated funds, or any of their respective officers, directors, agents, shareholders, members, partners, affiliates and subsidiaries (other than Holdco and its subsidiaries), even if the opportunity is one that Holdco or its subsidiaries might reasonably be deemed to have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so. The Holdco bye-laws provide that no such person will be liable to Holdco or any of its subsidiaries (for breach of any duty or otherwise), as a director or officer or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such person pursues or acquires such business opportunity, directs such business opportunity to another person or fails to present such business opportunity, or information regarding such business opportunity, to Holdco or its subsidiaries; provided, that the foregoing will not apply to any such person who is a director or officer of Holdco, if such business opportunity is expressly offered to such director or officer in writing solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of Holdco. This may cause the strategic interests of Holdco\u2019s Sponsor Shareholders to differ from, and conflict with, the interests of Holdco and of Holdco\u2019s other shareholders in material respects.\nFuture sales of Holdco common shares, or the perception in the public markets that such sales may occur, may depress the Holdco share price.\nSales of substantial amounts of Holdco common shares in the public market after this offering, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the price of Holdco common shares and could impair Holdco\u2019s ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares.\nHoldco has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to conduct a registered, underwritten public offering prior to the date that is six months from the closing of the mergers, unless the Triton debt agreements have been amended in a manner that a transfer by certain Triton shareholders would not trigger a change of control (as defined in the Triton debt agreements), or all such debt agreements have been terminated and have not been replaced with new debt agreements that contain similar change of control provisions that would be triggered by any such transfer. In addition, to the extent that Pritzker Shareholders (as defined in Exhibit G to the Transaction Agreement) or Sponsor Shareholders sell, or indicate an intent to sell, substantial amounts of Holdco\u2019s common shares in the public market after the contractual lock-ups and other legal restrictions on resale lapse, the trading price of the Holdco common shares could decline significantly. These factors could also make it more difficult for Holdco to raise additional funds through future offerings of its common shares or other securities.\nIssuing additional common shares or other equity securities or securities convertible into equity for financing or in connection with Holdco\u2019s incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise may dilute the economic and voting rights of Holdco\u2019s existing shareholders or reduce the market price of the Holdco common shares or both. Upon liquidation, holders of Holdco\u2019s debt securities, if issued, and lenders with respect to other borrowings would receive a distribution of Holdco\u2019s available assets prior to the holders of Holdco common shares. Debt securities convertible into equity could be subject to adjustments in the conversion ratio pursuant to which certain events may increase the number of equity securities issuable upon conversion. Holdco\u2019s decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond its control, which may materially adversely affect the amount, timing or nature of Holdco\u2019s future offerings. Thus, holders of Holdco common shares bear the risk that Holdco\u2019s future offerings may reduce the market price of Holdco\u2019s common shares. See Holdco\u2019s Form S-4/A in the section titled \u201cDescription of Holdco Common Shares\u201d as filed with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nIn the future, Holdco may also issue its securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of Holdco common shares issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of Holdco\u2019s then-outstanding common shares. Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in dilution to existing Holdco shareholders.\nHoldco is incorporated in Bermuda and a significant portion of its assets will be located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States against Holdco.\nHoldco is incorporated under the laws of Bermuda and a significant portion of its assets will be located outside the United States. It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the United States against Holdco in Bermuda or in countries, other than the United States, where Holdco will have assets, based on the civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States. In addition, there is some doubt as to whether the courts of Bermuda and other\ncountries would recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained against Holdco or Holdco\u2019s officers or directors based on the civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States or would hear actions against Holdco or those persons based on those laws. Holdco has been advised by its legal advisors in Bermuda that the United States and Bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on United States federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Bermuda. Similarly, those judgments may not be enforceable in countries, other than the United States, where Holdco will have assets.\nBermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to shareholders.\nHoldco\u2019s shareholders might have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States. As a Bermuda company, Holdco is governed by the Bermuda Companies Act 1981, as amended, which we refer to as the Bermuda Companies Act. The Bermuda Companies Act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to United States corporations and shareholders, including the provisions relating to interested directors, mergers, amalgamations and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors. See Holdco\u2019s Form S-4/A in the section titled \u201cDescription of Holdco Common Shares\u201d as filed with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nCertain provisions of the Sponsor Shareholders Agreements, Holdco\u2019s memorandum of association and amended and restated bye-laws and Bermuda law could hinder, delay or prevent a change in control of Holdco that you might consider favorable, which could also adversely affect the price of Holdco common shares.\nCertain provisions under the Sponsor Shareholders Agreements, Holdco\u2019s memorandum of association and amended and restated bye-laws and Bermuda law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of Holdco, even if doing so would benefit Holdco\u2019s shareholders. These provisions may include customary anti-takeover provisions and certain rights of our Sponsor Shareholders with respect to the designation of directors for nomination and election to the Holdco Board, including the ability to appoint members to each board committee.\nAnti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of Holdco\u2019s public shareholders to benefit from a change in control or change of Holdco\u2019s management and board of directors and, as a result, may materially adversely affect the market price of Holdco common shares and Holdco shareholders ability to realize any potential change of control premium. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause Holdco to take other corporate actions you desire.
