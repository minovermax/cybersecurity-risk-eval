{"cik": "909108", "company": "DIAMOND HILL INVESTMENT GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nOur future results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and capital resources, as well as the market price of our common stock, are subject to various risks, including those risks mentioned below and those risks that are discussed from time-to-time in our other periodic filings with the SEC. Investors should carefully consider these risks, along with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision regarding our common shares. There may be additional risks of which we are currently unaware, or which we currently consider immaterial. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital resources and the value of our common stock. Please see \u201cForward Looking Statements\u201d within Part I, Item 1, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness Risks\nPoor investment results or adverse ratings of our products could affect our ability to attract new clients or could reduce our AUM, potentially negatively impacting revenue and net income.\nIf we fail to deliver acceptable investment results for our clients, both in the short and long term, we could experience diminished investor interest and a decreased level of AUM.\nInvestment strategies are assessed and rated by independent third parties, including rating agencies, industry analysts, and publications. Investors can be influenced by such ratings. If a strategy receives an adverse report, it could negatively impact our AUM and our revenue.\nOur success depends on our key personnel, and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services.\nOur success depends on highly skilled personnel, including portfolio managers, research analysts, and management, many of whom have specialized expertise and extensive experience in the investment management industry. Financial services professionals are in high demand, and we face significant competition for qualified employees. Other than our Chief Executive Officer, our employees do not have employment contracts and generally can terminate their employment at any time. We may not be able to retain or replace key personnel. In order to retain or replace our key personnel, we may be required to increase compensation, which would decrease our net income. The loss of key personnel could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to retain and attract new employees and clients. A loss of client assets resulting from the departure of key personnel may materially decrease our revenues and net income.\nOur investment results and/or growth in our AUM may be constrained if appropriate investment opportunities are not available or if we close certain of our investment strategies to new investors.\nOur ability to deliver strong investment results depends in large part on our ability to identify appropriate investment opportunities in which to invest client assets. If we are unable to identify sufficient investment opportunities for existing and new client assets on a timely basis, our investment results could be adversely affected. The risk that appropriate investment opportunities may be unavailable is influenced by a number of factors, including general market conditions, and is likely to increase if our AUM increases rapidly. In addition, if we determine that sufficient investment opportunities are not available for an investment strategy, or we believe that it is necessary in order to continue to produce attractive returns from an investment strategy, we will consider closing the investment strategy to new investors. As of December 31, 2021, we have two investment strategies closed to new investors. If we misjudge the point at which it would be optimal to close an investment strategy, the investment results of the strategy could be negatively impacted.\nWe are subject to substantial competition in all aspects of our business.\nOur investment products compete against investment products and services from:\n\u2022Asset management firms;\n\u2022Mutual fund companies;\n\u2022Commercial banks and thrift institutions;\n\u2022Insurance companies;\n\u2022Exchange-traded funds;\n\u2022Private funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds; and\n\u2022Brokerage and investment banking firms.\nMany of our competitors have substantially greater resources and may operate in more markets or offer a broader range of products, including passively managed or \u201cindex\u201d products. Some of these institutions operate in a different regulatory environment, which may give them certain competitive advantages in the investment products and portfolio structures that they offer. We compete with other providers of investment services primarily based upon our philosophy, performance, and client service. Some institutions have a broader array of products and distribution channels, which makes it more difficult for us to compete. If current or potential customers decide to use one of our competitors, we could face a significant decline in market share, AUM, revenues, and net income. If we are required to lower our fees to remain competitive, our net income could be significantly reduced because some of our expenses are fixed, especially over shorter periods of time, and our expenses may not decrease in proportion to the decrease in revenues. Additionally, over the past several years, investors have generally shown a preference for passive investment products over actively managed strategies. If this trend continues, our AUM may be negatively impacted.\nMarket and competitive pressures in recent years have created a trend towards lower management fees in the asset management industry and there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current fee structure. As a result, a shift in our AUM from higher to lower fee generating clients and strategies could result in a decrease in profitability even if our AUM increases or remains unchanged.\nThe loss of access to, or increased fees required by, third-party distribution sources to market our portfolios and access our client base could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur ability to attract additional AUM is dependent on our relationship with third-party financial intermediaries. We compensate some of these intermediaries for access to investors and for various marketing services provided. These distribution sources and client bases may not continue to be accessible to us for reasonable terms, or at all. If such access is restricted or eliminated, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Fees paid to financial intermediaries for investor access and marketing services have generally increased in recent years. If such fee increases continue, refusal to pay them could restrict our access to those client bases while paying them could adversely affect our profitability.\nA significant portion of our revenues are based on advisory and administration agreements with our Funds that are subject to termination without cause and on short notice.\nWe are highly dependent on our contractual relationships with the Funds. If our advisory or administration agreements with the Funds were terminated or not renewed, or were amended or modified to reduce fees, we would be materially and adversely affected. Generally, these agreements are terminable by either party upon 60 days\u2019 prior written notice without penalty. The Funds\u2019 agreements are subject to annual approval by either: (i) the board of trustees of the Funds, or (ii) a vote of the majority\nof the outstanding voting securities of each Fund. These agreements automatically terminate in the event of their assignment by either us or the Funds. We generated approximately 69%, 75%, and 77% of our 2021, 2020, and 2019 revenues, respectively, from our advisory and administration agreements with the Funds, including 30%, 10%, and 9% from the advisory contracts with the Diamond Hill Large Cap Fund, the Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund, and the Diamond Hill Small-Mid Cap Fund, respectively, during 2021. The loss of any of the Diamond Hill Large Cap Fund, the Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund, or the Diamond Hill Small-Mid Cap Fund contracts would have a material adverse effect on us. We believe that we have strong relationships with the Funds and their boards of trustees, and we have no reason to believe that these advisory or administration contracts will not be renewed in the future. However, there can be no assurance that the Funds will choose to continue their relationships with us.\nNegative Public opinion of us could cause us to lose clients and adversely affect our stock price.\nNegative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including trading practices, corporate governance and acquisitions, social media and other marketing activities, and actions taken by governmental regulators and community organizations in response to any of the foregoing. Negative public opinion could adversely affect our ability to attract and maintain clients, could expose us to potential litigation or regulatory action, and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price or result in heightened volatility.\nOperational Risks\nCybersecurity attacks could prevent us from managing client portfolios or cause the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client information, both of which could severely harm our business.\nAs part of our business, we collect, process, and transmit sensitive and confidential information about our clients and employees, as well as proprietary information about our business. We have policies and procedures pursuant to which we take numerous security measures to prevent cyberattacks of various kinds as well as fraudulent and inadvertent activity by persons who have been granted access to such confidential information. Nevertheless, our systems, like all technology systems, remain vulnerable to unauthorized access, which can result in theft or corruption of information. In addition, we share information with third parties upon whom we rely for various functions. The systems of such third parties also are vulnerable to cyber threats. Unauthorized access can come from unrelated third parties through the internet, from access to hardware removed from our premises or those of third parties or from employees acting intentionally or inadvertently.\nCybersecurity incidents can involve, among other things: (i) deliberate attacks designed to corrupt our information systems and make them unusable by us to operate our business; (ii) theft of information used by the perpetrators for financial and other gain; or (iii) inadvertent releases of information by employees or third parties with whom we do business.\nCyberattacks that corrupt our information systems and make them unusable could impair our ability to trade securities in our clients\u2019 accounts. Corruption of the systems of our third-party vendors could impact us to the same extent as corruption of our own systems. If information about our employees is intentionally stolen or inadvertently made public, that information could be used to commit identity theft, obtain credit in an employee\u2019s name, or steal from an employee. If information about our business is obtained by unauthorized persons, whether through intentional attacks or inadvertent releases of information, it could be used to harm our competitive position.\nWhether information is corrupted, stolen, or inadvertently disclosed, and regardless of the type and nature of the information (e.g., proprietary information about our business or personal information about clients or employees), the results could be multiple and materially harmful to us, including the following:\n\u2022Our reputation could be harmed, resulting in the loss of clients, vendors, and employees or making payments or concessions to such persons to maintain our relationships with them;\n\u2022Our inability to operate our business fully, even if temporarily, and thus, fulfill contracts with clients or vendors, could result in terminations of contracts and loss of revenue;\n\u2022Harm suffered by clients or vendors whose contracts have been breached, or by clients, vendors, or employees whose information is compromised, could result in costly litigation against us;\n\u2022Our need to focus attention on remediation of a cyber issue could take our attention away from the operation of our business, resulting in lost revenue;\n\u2022We could incur costs to repair systems made inoperable by a cyberattack and to make changes to our systems to reduce future cyber threats. Those changes could include, among other things, obtaining additional technologies as well as employing additional personnel and training employees; and\n\u2022The interruption of our business or theft of proprietary information could harm our ability to compete.\nAny of the above potential impacts of a cybersecurity incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to adapt to technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers while reducing costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address customer needs by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We may not be able to implement effectively new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological changes affecting the financial services industry could negatively affect our growth, revenue, and profit.\nOperational risks may disrupt our business, result in losses, or limit our growth.\nWe are dependent on the capacity and reliability of the communications, information, and technology systems supporting our operations, whether developed, owned, or operated internally by us or by third parties. Operational risks, such as trading or operational errors, interruption of our financial, accounting, trading, compliance, and other data processing systems, the loss of data contained in such systems, or compromised systems due to cyberattack, could result in a disruption of our business, liability to clients, regulatory intervention, or reputational damage, and thus, adversely affect our business.\nTrading in our common shares is limited, which may adversely affect the time and the price at which you can sell your shares.\nAlthough our common shares are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the shares are held by a relatively small number of shareholders, and trading in our common shares is relatively inactive. The spread between the bid and the ask prices is often wide. As a result, shareholders may not be able to sell their shares on short notice, and the sale of a large number of shares at one time could temporarily depress the market price. In addition, certain shareholders, including certain of our directors and officers, own a significant number of shares. The sale of a large number of shares by any such individual could temporarily depress the market price of our shares.\nNatural disasters, global pandemics and other unpredictable events could adversely affect our operations.\nNatural disasters, outbreaks of epidemics or pandemics, terrorist attacks, extreme weather events or other unpredictable events could adversely affect our revenues, expenses, and net income by:\n\u2022decreasing investment valuations in, and returns on, the investment portfolios that we manage and our corporate investments, thus causing reductions in revenue,\n\u2022causing disruptions in national or global economies that decrease investor confidence and make investment products generally less attractive,\n\u2022reducing the availability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business activities,\n\u2022interrupting the Company\u2019s business operations or those of critical service providers,\n\u2022triggering technology delays or failures, and\n\u2022requiring substantial capital expenditures and operating expenses to restore our operations.\nThe Company has developed various backup systems and contingency plans but cannot be assured that those preparations will be adequate in all circumstances that could arise, or that material interruptions and disruptions will not occur. The Company also relies to varying degrees on outside vendors for service delivery in addition to technology and disaster contingency support, and there is a risk that these vendors will not be able to perform in an adequate and timely manner. If the Company loses the availability of employees, or if it is unable to respond adequately to such an event in a timely manner, revenues, expenses, and net income could be negatively impacted.\nSpecifically, the effects of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) since early 2020 have negatively affected the global economy, the United States economy and the global financial markets, and may disrupt the Company\u2019s operations, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Although the long-term effects of the current pandemic cannot currently be predicted, previous occurrences of other pandemic and epidemic diseases had an adverse effect on the economies of those countries in which they were most prevalent. A recurrence of an\noutbreak of any kind of epidemic, communicable disease or virus or major public health issue could cause a slowdown in the levels of economic activity generally, which would adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and operations.\nIndustry, Market, and Economic Risks\nOur AUM, which impacts revenue, is subject to significant fluctuations.\nThe majority of our revenue is calculated as a percentage of AUM or is related to the general performance of the equity securities markets. A decline in securities prices or in the sale of investment products, or an increase in fund redemptions, generally will reduce revenue and net income. Financial market declines will generally negatively impact the level of our AUM, and consequently, our revenue and net income. A recession or other economic or political events, whether in the United States or globally, could also adversely impact our revenue, if such events led to a decreased demand for products, a higher redemption rate, or a decline in securities prices.\nOur investment approach may underperform other investment approaches during certain market conditions.\nOur investment strategies are best suited for investors with long-term investment time horizons. Our investment strategies may not perform well during certain periods of time. Additionally, we could have common positions and industry concentrations across our strategies at the same time. As such, factors leading to underperformance may impact multiple strategies simultaneously.\nOur investment income and asset levels may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in our investment portfolio.\nWe currently have a substantial portion of our assets invested in investment strategies that we manage. All of these investments are subject to market risk and our non-operating investment income could be adversely affected by adverse market performance. Fluctuations in investment income are expected to occur in the future.\nRegulatory Risks\nChanges in tax laws and unanticipated tax obligations could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local income taxes in the United States. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken or implement changes in tax policy, which may result in the assessment of additional taxes. We regularly assess the appropriateness of our tax positions and reporting. We cannot provide assurances, however, that tax authorities will agree with the positions we have taken, or that we will accurately predict the outcomes of audits, and the actual outcomes of these audits could be unfavorable.\nOur business is subject to substantial governmental regulation, which can change frequently and may increase costs of compliance, reduce revenue, result in fines, penalties, and lawsuits for noncompliance, and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to a variety of federal securities laws, including the Advisers Act, the 1940 Act, the 1933 Act, the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the U.S. PATRIOT Act of 2001, and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. In addition, we are subject to significant regulation and oversight by the SEC. Changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax, and compliance requirements could have a significant effect on our operations and results, including, but not limited to, increased expenses and reduced investor interest in certain funds and other investment products we offer. We continually monitor legislative, tax, regulatory, accounting, and compliance developments that could impact our business. We and our directors, officers, and employees could be subject to lawsuits or regulatory proceedings for violations of such laws and regulations, which could result in the payment of fines or penalties and cause reputational harm to us which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as divert management\u2019s attention from our operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur insurance policies may not cover all losses and costs to which we may be exposed.\nWe carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate. Our insurance may not cover all liabilities and losses to which we may be exposed. Certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods. As our insurance policies come up for renewal, we may need to assume higher deductibles or pay higher premiums, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 86818, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "DHIL"}
