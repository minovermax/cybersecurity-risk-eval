Risk Factors\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks. The following discussion highlights some of these risks. and others are discussed elsewhere in this report. These and other risks could materially and adversely affect our business, revenue, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nAdaptHealth\u2019s revenue could be impacted by federal and state changes to reimbursement and other aspects of Medicaid and Medicare.\nAdaptHealth derived approximately 32% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 from Medicare and various state-based Medicaid programs. These programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes affecting overall spending, base rates or basis of payment, retroactive rate adjustments, annual caps that limit the amount that can be paid (including deductible and coinsurance amounts) for rehabilitation therapy services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries, administrative or executive orders and government funding restrictions, all of which may materially adversely affect the rates and frequency at which these programs reimburse AdaptHealth. For example, the Medicaid Integrity Contractor program is increasing the scrutiny placed on Medicaid payments and could result in recoupments of alleged overpayments in an effort to rein in Medicaid spending. Recent budget proposals and legislation at both the federal and state levels have called for cuts in reimbursement for healthcare providers participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Enactment and implementation of measures to reduce or delay reimbursement or overall Medicare or Medicaid spending could result in substantial reductions in AdaptHealth\u2019s revenue and profitability. Payors may disallow AdaptHealth\u2019s requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain costs are not reimbursable or reasonable because either adequate or additional documentation was not provided or because certain services were not covered or considered reasonably necessary. Additionally, revenue from these payors can be retroactively adjusted after a new examination during the claims settlement process or as a result of post-payment audits.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s business may be adversely impacted by healthcare reform efforts, including repeal of or significant modifications to, the ACA.\nIn recent years, the U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have considered and passed a number of laws that are intended to result in significant changes to the healthcare industry. However, there is significant uncertainty regarding the future of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d), the most prominent of these reform efforts. The law has been subject to legislative and regulatory changes and court challenges, and the current presidential administration and certain members of Congress have stated their intent to repeal or make additional significant changes to the ACA, its implementation or its interpretation. In 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts was enacted, which, effective January 1, 2019, among other things, removed penalties for not complying with ACA\u2019s individual mandate to carry health insurance. In addition, President Trump has signed an executive order that directs agencies to minimize \u201ceconomic and regulatory burdens\u201d of the ACA. Because the penalty associated with the individual mandate was eliminated, a federal judge in Texas ruled in December 2018 that the entire ACA was unconstitutional. The presidential administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, and on December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the lower court\u2019s finding that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the lower court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the full ACA. Pending review, the law remains in effect, but it is unclear at this time what effect the latest ruling will have on the status of the ACA. These changes and court challenges may impact the number of individuals that elect to obtain public or private health insurance or the scope of such coverage, if purchased. The presidential administration and the U.S. Congress may take further action regarding the ACA, including, but not limited to, repeal or replacement. Additionally, all or a portion of the ACA and related subsequent legislation may be modified, repealed or otherwise invalidated through further legislation or judicial challenge, which could result in reduced funding for state Medicaid programs, lower numbers of insured individuals, and reduced coverage for insured individuals. There is uncertainty regarding whether, when, and how the ACA will be further changed, what alternative provisions, if any, will be enacted, and the impact of alternative provisions on providers and other healthcare industry participants. Government efforts to repeal or change the ACA or to implement alternative reform measures could cause AdaptHealth\u2019s revenues to decrease to the extent such legislation reduces Medicaid and/or Medicare reimbursement rates.\nAdaptHealth is affected by continuing efforts by private third-party payors to control their costs. If AdaptHealth agrees to lower its reimbursement rates due to pricing pressures from private third-party payors, AdaptHealth\u2019s financial condition and results of operations would likely deteriorate.\nAdaptHealth derived approximately 57% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 from third-party private payors. Such payors continually seek to control the cost of providing healthcare services through direct contracts with healthcare providers, increased oversight and greater enrollment of patients in managed care programs and preferred provider organizations. These private payors are increasingly demanding discounted fee structures, including setting reimbursement rates based on Medicare fee schedules and the assumption by the healthcare provider of all or a portion of the financial risk. Reimbursement payments under private payor programs may not remain at current levels and may not be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients eligible for reimbursement pursuant to such programs, and AdaptHealth may suffer deterioration in pricing flexibility, changes in payor mix and growth in operating expenses in excess of increases in payments by private third-party payors. AdaptHealth may be compelled to lower its prices due to increased pricing pressures, which could adversely impact AdaptHealth\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in governmental or private payor supply replenishment schedules could adversely affect AdaptHealth.\nAdaptHealth generated approximately 42% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 through the sale of masks, tubing and other ancillary products related to patients utilizing CPAP devices. Medicare, Medicaid and private payors limit the number of times per year that patients may purchase such supplies. To the extent that any governmental or private payor revises their resupply guidelines to reduce the number of times such supplies can be purchased, such reductions could adversely impact AdaptHealth\u2019s revenue, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdaptHealth generates a significant portion of its revenue from the provision of sleep therapy equipment and supplies to patients, and AdaptHealth is therefore highly dependent on it for its success.\nApproximately 58% of AdaptHealth\u2019s revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was generated from the provision of sleep therapy equipment and supplies to patients. AdaptHealth\u2019s ability to execute its growth strategy therefore depends upon the adoption by patients, physicians and sleep centers, among others, of AdaptHealth\u2019s sleep therapy equipment and supplies to treat their patients suffering from OSA. There can be no assurance that AdaptHealth will continue to maintain broad acceptance among physicians and patients. Any failure by AdaptHealth to satisfy physician or patient demand or to maintain meaningful market acceptance will harm its business and future prospects.\nAdaptHealth may be adversely affected by consolidation among health insurers and other industry participants.\nIn recent years, a number of health insurers have merged or increased efforts to consolidate with other non-governmental payors. Insurers are also increasingly pursuing alignment initiatives with healthcare providers. Consolidation within the health insurance industry may result in insurers having increased negotiating leverage and competitive advantages, such as greater access to performance and pricing data. AdaptHealth\u2019s ability to negotiate prices and favorable terms with health insurers in certain markets could be affected negatively as a result of this consolidation. In addition, the shift toward value-based payment models could be accelerated if larger insurers, including those engaging in consolidation activities, find these models to be financially beneficial. There can be no assurance that AdaptHealth will be able to negotiate favorable terms with payors and otherwise respond effectively to the impact of increased consolidation in the payor industry or vertical integration efforts.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s payor contracts are subject to renegotiation or termination, which could result in a decrease in AdaptHealth\u2019s revenue or profits.\nThe majority of AdaptHealth\u2019s payor contracts are subject to unilateral termination by either party on between 30 and 90 days\u2019 prior written notice. Such contracts are routinely amended (sometimes by unilateral action by payors regarding payment policy), renegotiated, subjected to a bidding process with AdaptHealth\u2019s competitors, or terminated altogether. Sometimes in the renegotiation process, certain lines of business may not be renewed or a payor may enlarge\nits provider network or otherwise adversely change the way it conducts its business with AdaptHealth. In other cases, a payor may reduce its provider network in exchange for lower payment rates. AdaptHealth\u2019s revenue from a payor may also be adversely affected if the payor alters its utilization management expectations and/or administrative procedures for payments and audits, changes its order of preference among the providers to which it refers business or imposes a third-party administrator, network manager or other intermediary. Any reduction in AdaptHealth\u2019s projected home respiratory therapy/home medical equipment revenues as a result of these or other factors could lead to a reduction in AdaptHealth\u2019s revenues. There can be no assurance that AdaptHealth\u2019s payor contracts will not be terminated or altered in ways that are unfavorable to AdaptHealth as a result of renegotiation or such administrative changes. Payors may decide to refer business to their owned provider subsidiaries, such as specialty pharmaceuticals and/or HME networks owned by such payors or by third-party management companies. These activities could materially reduce AdaptHealth\u2019s revenue from these payors.\nIf AdaptHealth fails to manage the complex and lengthy reimbursement process, its revenue, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.\nBecause AdaptHealth depends upon reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and third-party payors for a significant majority of its revenues, AdaptHealth\u2019s revenue, financial condition and results of operations may be affected by the reimbursement process, which in the healthcare industry is complex and can involve lengthy delays between the time that services are rendered and the time that the reimbursement amounts are settled. Depending on the payor, AdaptHealth may be required to obtain certain payor-specific documentation from physicians and other healthcare providers before submitting claims for reimbursement. Certain payors have filing deadlines and will not pay claims submitted after such time. AdaptHealth cannot ensure that it will be able to effectively manage the reimbursement process and collect payments for its equipment and services promptly.\nIf the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) require prior authorization or implement changes in documentation necessary for AdaptHealth\u2019s products, AdaptHealth\u2019s revenue, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nCMS has established and maintains a Master List of Items Frequently Subject to Unnecessary Utilization of certain DMEPOS that the Secretary determined, based on prior payment experience, are frequently subject to unnecessary utilization. This list identifies items that CMS has determined could potentially be subject to Prior Authorization as a condition of Medicare payment. Since 2012, CMS has also maintained a list of categories of DMEPOS items to include face-to-face encounters with practitioners and written orders before furnishing the items to beneficiaries. On November 8, 2019 CMS combined and harmonized the two lists to create a single unified Master List of DMEPOS Items Potentially Subject to Face-To-Face Encounter and Written Order Prior to Delivery and/or Prior Authorization Requirements (\u201cMaster List\u201d). In November 2019, CMS also reduced the financial threshold for inclusion on the Master List. With certain exceptions for reductions in Payment Threshold, items remain on the Master List for 10 years from the date the item was added to the Master List. The presence of an item on the Master List does not automatically mean that a prior authorization is required. Currently, CMS selects items from the Master List for inclusion on the \u201cRequired Prior Authorization List.\u201d The expanded Master List would increase the number of DMEPOS items potentially eligible to be selected for prior authorization, face-to-face encounter and written order prior to delivery requirements as a condition of payment.\nOn April 22, 2019, CMS has added items that are a part of AdaptHealth\u2019s product lines to the Master List of Items Frequently Subject to Unnecessary Utilization. If CMS adds additional products to the Master List, expands Prior Authorization requirements or expands Face-to-Face Encounter and Written Order Prior to Delivery requirements to products in AdaptHealth\u2019s product line, such requirements may adversely impact AdaptHealth\u2019s revenue, financial condition and results from operations.\nReimbursement claims are subject to audits by various governmental and private payor entities from time to time and such audits may negatively affect AdaptHealth\u2019s revenue, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdaptHealth receives a substantial portion of its revenues from the Medicare program. Medicare reimbursement claims made by healthcare providers, including HME providers, are subject to audit from time to time by governmental\npayors and their agents, such as Medicare Administrative Contractors (\u201cMACs\u201d) that act as fiscal intermediaries for all Medicare billings, auditors contracted by CMS, and insurance carriers, as well as HHS-OIG, CMS and state Medicaid programs. These include specific requirements imposed by the Durable Medical Equipment Medicare Administrative Contractor (\u201cDME MAC\u201d) Supplier Manuals. To ensure compliance with Medicare, Medicaid and other regulations, government agencies or their contractors, including MACs, Recovery Audit Contractors and Zone Program Integrity Contractors, often conduct audits and request customer records and other documents to support our claims submitted for payment of services rendered. In many instances, there are only limited publicly-available guidelines and methodologies for determining errors with certain audits. As a result, there can be a significant lack of clarity regarding required documentation and audit methodology. The clarity and completeness of each patient medical file, some of which is the work product of physicians not employed by AdaptHealth, is essential to successfully challenging any payment denials. For example, the DME MAC Supplier Manuals provide that clinical information from the \u201cpatient\u2019s medical record\u201d is required to justify the initial and ongoing medical necessity for the provision of DME. Some DME MACs, CMS staff and government subcontractors have taken the position, that the \u201cpatient\u2019s medical record\u201d refers not to documentation maintained by the Durable Medical Equipment (\u201cDME\u201d) supplier but instead to documentation maintained by the patient\u2019s physician, healthcare facility or other clinician, and that clinical information created by the DME supplier\u2019s personnel and confirmed by the patient\u2019s physician is not sufficient to establish medical necessity. If the physicians working with AdaptHealth\u2019s patients do not adequately document, among other things, their diagnoses and plans of care, AdaptHealth\u2019s risks related to audits and payment denials in general are greater. Depending on the nature of the conduct found in such audits and whether the underlying conduct could be considered systemic, the resolution of these audits could adversely impact AdaptHealth\u2019s revenue, financial condition and results of operations.\nCMS has developed and instituted various audit programs under which CMS contracts with private companies to conduct claims and medical record audits. These audits are in addition to those conducted by existing MACs. Some contractors are paid a percentage of the overpayments recovered. One type of audit contractor, the Recovery Audit Contractors (\u201cRACs\u201d), receive claims data directly from MACs on a monthly or quarterly basis and are authorized to review previously paid claims. It is unclear whether CMS intends to conduct RAC prepayment reviews in the future and if so, what providers and claims would be the focus of those reviews.\nMoreover, the ACA now requires that overpayments be reported and returned within 60 days of identification of the overpayment. Any overpayment retained after this deadline will now be considered an \u201cobligation\u201d for purposes of the False Claims Act and subject to fines and penalties. CMS currently has a six-year \u201clookback period,\u201d for reporting and returning the \u201cidentified\u201d overpayment. Private payors also reserve rights to conduct audits and make monetary adjustments.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s third-party payors may also, from time to time, request audits of the amounts paid, or to be paid, to AdaptHealth. AdaptHealth could be adversely affected in some of the markets in which it operates if the auditing payor alleges substantial overpayments were made to AdaptHealth due to coding errors or lack of documentation to support medical necessity determinations.\nAdaptHealth cannot currently predict the adverse impact, if any, that these audits, methodologies and interpretations might have on its financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificant reimbursement reductions and/or exclusion from markets or product lines could adversely affect AdaptHealth.\nAll Medicare Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, & Supplies (\u201cDMEPOS\u201d) Competitive Bidding Program contracts expired on December 31, 2018, and, as a result, there is a temporary gap in the entire DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program that CMS expects will last until December 31, 2020.\nOn March 7, 2019, CMS announced plans to consolidate the competitive bidding areas (\u2018CBAs\u201d) included in the Round 1 2017 and Round 2 Recompete DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Programs into a single round of competition named \u201cRound 2021.\u201d Round 2021 contracts are scheduled to become effective on January 1, 2021, and extend through December 31, 2023. The bid window for the Round 2021 DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program closed on September 18, 2019.\nFor each CBA, providers will submit bids to CMS offering to supply certain covered items of DME in the CBA at certain prices. A number of products in AdaptHealth\u2019s product lines are included on the list of products subject to Round 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2019, AdaptHealth estimates that approximately $145 million of revenue was generated with respect to covered items in competitive bidding areas subject to Round 2021.The $145.0 million estimate excludes amounts generated in non-rural and rural non-bid areas, as well as, products not currently part of Competitive Bidding Programs. As part of the competitive bidding process, single payment amounts (\u201cSPAs\u201d) replace the current Medicare durable medical equipment fee schedule payment amounts for selected items in certain areas of the country. The SPAs are determined by using bids submitted by DME suppliers. CMS will select winning bidders based upon the CMS-determined demand in each CBA, and the price assigned to the winning bidders shall be the price submitted by the final bidder accepted to meet such CBA\u2019s volume demand. Successful bidders are expected to meet certain program quality standards in order to be awarded a contract and only successful bidders can supply the covered items to Medicare beneficiaries in the acquisition area (there are, however, regulations in place that allow non-contracted providers to continue to provide equipment and services to their existing customers at the new prices determined through the bidding process). The contracts are expected to be re-bid at least every three years. CMS is required to award contracts to multiple entities submitting bids in each area for an item or service, but has the authority to limit the number of contractors in a competitive acquisition area to the number it determines to be necessary to meet projected demand. AdaptHealth\u2019s exclusion from certain markets or product lines could materially adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe competitive bidding process has historically put pressure on the amount AdaptHealth is reimbursed in the markets in which it exists, as well as in areas that are not subject to the Competitive Bidding Program. The rates required to win future competitive bids could continue to compress reimbursement rates. AdaptHealth will continue to monitor developments regarding the competitive bidding program. While AdaptHealth cannot predict the outcome of the competitive bidding program on its business in the future nor the Medicare payment rates that will be in effect in future years for the items subjected to competitive bidding, the program may materially adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure by AdaptHealth to maintain controls and processes over billing and collections or the deterioration of the financial condition of AdaptHealth\u2019s payors or disputes with third parties could have a significant negative impact on its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe collection of accounts receivable requires constant focus and involvement by management and ongoing enhancements to information systems and billing center operating procedures. There can be no assurance that AdaptHealth will be able to improve upon or maintain its current levels of collectability and days sales outstanding in future periods. Further, some of AdaptHealth\u2019s payors and/or patients may experience financial difficulties, or may otherwise not pay accounts receivable when due, resulting in increased write-offs. If AdaptHealth is unable to properly bill and collect its accounts receivable, its financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. In addition, from time to time AdaptHealth is involved in disputes with various parties, including its payors and their intermediaries regarding their performance of various contractual or regulatory obligations. These disputes sometimes lead to legal and other proceedings and cause AdaptHealth to incur costs or experience delays in collections, increases in its accounts receivable or loss of revenue. In addition, in the event such disputes are not resolved in AdaptHealth\u2019s favor or cause AdaptHealth to terminate its relationships with such parties, there may be an adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operations.\nIf AdaptHealth is unable to maintain or develop relationships with patient referral sources, its growth and profitability could be adversely affected.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s success depends in large part on referrals from acute care hospitals, sleep laboratories, pulmonologist offices, skilled nursing facilities, hospice operators and other patient referral sources in the communities served by AdaptHealth. By law, referral sources cannot be contractually obligated to refer patients to any specific provider. However, there can be no assurance that other market participants will not attempt to steer patients to competing post-acute providers or otherwise limit AdaptHealth\u2019s access to potential referrals. The establishment of joint ventures or networks between referral sources, such as acute care hospitals, and other post-acute providers may hinder patient referrals to AdaptHealth. AdaptHealth\u2019s growth and profitability depend on its ability to establish and maintain\nclose working relationships with patient referral sources and to increase awareness and acceptance of the benefits of inpatient rehabilitation, home health, and hospice care by its referral sources and their patients. There can be no assurance that AdaptHealth will be able to maintain its existing referral source relationships or that it will be able to develop and maintain new relationships in existing or new markets. AdaptHealth\u2019s loss of, or failure to maintain, existing relationships or its failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect its ability to grow its business and operate profitably.\nFailure by AdaptHealth to successfully design, modify and implement technology-based and other process changes to maximize productivity and ensure compliance could ultimately have a significant negative impact on AdaptHealth\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nAdaptHealth has identified a number of areas throughout its operations, including revenue cycle management and fulfilment logistics, where it intends to centralize and/or modify current processes or systems in order to attain a higher level of productivity or ensure compliance. Failure to achieve the cost savings or enhanced quality control expected from the successful design and implementation of such initiatives may adversely impact AdaptHealth\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, Medicare and Medicaid often change their documentation requirements with respect to claims submissions. The standards and rules for healthcare transactions, code sets and unique identifiers also continue to evolve, such as ICD 10 and HIPAA 5010 and other data security requirements. Moreover, government programs and/or commercial payors may have difficulties administering new standards and rules for healthcare transactions and this may adversely affect timelines of payment or payment error rates. The DMEPOS competitive bidding program also imposes new reporting requirements on contracted providers. Failure by AdaptHealth to successfully design and implement system or process modifications could have a significant impact on its operations and financial condition. From time to time, AdaptHealth\u2019s outsourced contractors for certain information systems functions, such as Brightree LLC and Parachute Health LLC, may make operational, leadership or other changes that could impact AdaptHealth\u2019s plans and cost-savings goals. The implementation of many of the new standards and rules will require AdaptHealth to make substantial investments. Further, the implementation of these system or process changes could have a disruptive effect on related transaction processing and operations. If AdaptHealth\u2019s implementation efforts related to systems development are unsuccessful, AdaptHealth may need to write off amounts that it has capitalized related to systems development projects. Additionally, if systems development implementations do not occur, AdaptHealth may need to incur additional costs to support its existing systems.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s business depends on its information systems, including software licensed from third parties. AdaptHealth\u2019s information systems and those of AdaptHealth\u2019s third-party software providers are subject to security breaches and other cybersecurity incidents, which may disrupt AdaptHealth\u2019s operations.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s business depends on the proper functioning and availability of its computer systems and networks. AdaptHealth relies on an external service provider to provide continual maintenance, upgrading and enhancement of AdaptHealth\u2019s primary information systems used for its operational needs. AdaptHealth licenses third-party software that supports intake, personnel scheduling and other human resources functions, office clinical and centralized billing and receivables management in an integrated database, enabling AdaptHealth to standardize the care delivered across its network of locations and monitor its performance and consumer outcomes. AdaptHealth also uses a third-party software provider for its order processing and inventory management platform. To the extent that its third-party providers fail to support, maintain and upgrade such software or systems, or if AdaptHealth loses its licenses with third-party providers, the efficiency of AdaptHealth\u2019s operations could be disrupted or reduced.\nIf AdaptHealth experiences a reduction in the performance, reliability, or availability of its information systems, its operations and ability to process transactions and produce timely and accurate reports could be adversely affected. If AdaptHealth experiences difficulties with the transition and integration of information systems or is unable to implement, maintain, or expand its systems properly, AdaptHealth could suffer from, among other things, operational disruptions, regulatory problems, and increases in administrative expenses.\nThere can be no assurance that AdaptHealth\u2019s and its third-party software providers\u2019 safety and security measures and disaster recovery plan will prevent damage, interruption or breach of its information systems and operations. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems\nchange frequently and may be difficult to detect, AdaptHealth may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, hardware, software or applications AdaptHealth develops or procures from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise the security of its information systems. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to AdaptHealth\u2019s systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom AdaptHealth does business, through fraud or other forms of deceiving its employees or contractors. On occasion, AdaptHealth has acquired additional information systems through its business acquisitions. AdaptHealth has upgraded and expanded its information system capabilities and has committed significant resources to maintain, protect, enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, and changing customer preferences. In addition, costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems also could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of AdaptHealth\u2019s operations. A cyber security attack or other incident that bypasses AdaptHealth\u2019s information systems security could cause a security breach which may lead to a material disruption to its information systems infrastructure or business and may involve a significant loss of business or patient health information. If a cyber security attack or other unauthorized attempt to access AdaptHealth\u2019s systems or facilities were to be successful, it could result in the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential information or intellectual property, and could cause operational or business delays that may materially impact AdaptHealth\u2019s ability to provide various healthcare services. Any successful cyber security attack or other unauthorized attempt to access AdaptHealth\u2019s systems or facilities also could result in negative publicity which could damage its reputation or brand with its patients, referral sources, payors or other third parties and could subject AdaptHealth to substantial penalties under HIPAA and other federal and state privacy laws, in addition to private litigation with those affected. Failure to maintain the security and functionality of AdaptHealth\u2019s information systems and related software, or a failure to defend a cyber security attack or other attempt to gain unauthorized access to AdaptHealth\u2019s systems, facilities or patient health information, could expose AdaptHealth to a number of adverse consequences, the vast majority of which are not insurable, including but not limited to disruptions in AdaptHealth\u2019s operations, regulatory and other civil and criminal penalties, fines, investigations and enforcement actions (including, but not limited to, those arising from the SEC, Federal Trade Commission, the OIG or state attorneys general), private litigation with those affected by the data breach, loss of customers, disputes with payors and increased operating expense, which could adversely impact AdaptHealth\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nAdaptHealth experiences competition from numerous other home respiratory and mobility equipment providers, and this competition could adversely affect its revenues and its business.\nThe home respiratory and mobility equipment markets are highly competitive and include a large number of providers, some of which are national providers, but most of which are either regional or local providers, including hospital systems, physician specialists and sleep labs. The primary competitive factors are quality considerations such as responsiveness, access to payor contracts, the technical ability of the professional staff and the ability to provide comprehensive services. These markets are very fragmented. Some of AdaptHealth\u2019s competitors may now or in the future have greater financial or marketing resources than AdaptHealth. In addition, in certain markets, competitors may have more effective sales and marketing activities. AdaptHealth\u2019s largest national home respiratory/home medical equipment provider competitors include AeroCare Holdings, Inc., Apria Healthcare Group Inc., Lincare Holdings Inc. and Rotech Healthcare Inc. The rest of the homecare market in the United States consists of regional providers and product-specific providers, as well as numerous local organizations. Hospitals and health systems are routinely looking to provide coverage and better control of post-acute healthcare services, including homecare services of the types AdaptHealth provides. These trends may continue as new payment models evolve, including bundled payment models, shared savings programs, value based purchasing and other payment systems.\nThere are relatively few barriers to entry in local home healthcare markets, and new entrants to the home respiratory/home medical equipment markets could have a material adverse effect on AdaptHealth\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. A number of manufacturers of home respiratory equipment currently provide equipment directly to patients on a limited basis. Such manufacturers have the ability to provide their equipment at prices below those charged by AdaptHealth, and there can be no assurance that such direct-to-patient sales efforts will not increase in the future or that such manufacturers will not seek reimbursement contracts directly with AdaptHealth\u2019s third-party payors, who could seek to provide equipment directly to patients from the manufacturer. In addition, pharmacy benefit managers (known as \u201cPBMs\u201d), including CVS Health Corporation and the OptumRx business of\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated, could enter the HME market and compete with AdaptHealth. Large technology companies, such as Amazon.com, Inc. and Alphabet Inc., have disrupted other supply businesses and have publicly stated an interest in the entering the healthcare market. In the event such companies enter the HME market, AdaptHealth may experience a loss of referrals or revenue.\nChanges in medical equipment technology and development of new treatments may cause AdaptHealth\u2019s current equipment or services to become obsolete.\nAdaptHealth evaluates changes in home medical equipment technology and treatments on an ongoing basis for purposes of determining the feasibility of replacing or supplementing items currently included in the patient service equipment inventory and services that AdaptHealth offers patients. AdaptHealth\u2019s selection of medical equipment and services is formulated on the basis of a variety of factors, including overall quality, functional reliability, availability of supply, payor reimbursement policies, product features, labor costs associated with the technology, acquisition, repair and ownership costs and overall patient and referral source demand, as well as patient therapeutic and lifestyle benefits. Manufacturers continue to invest in research and development to introduce new products to the marketplace. It is possible that major changes in available technology, payor benefit or coverage policies related to those changes or the preferences of patients and referral sources may cause AdaptHealth\u2019s current product offerings to become less competitive or obsolete, and it will be necessary to adapt to those changes. Unanticipated changes could cause AdaptHealth to incur increased capital expenditures and accelerated equipment write-offs, and could force AdaptHealth to alter its sales, operations and marketing strategies.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s operations involve the transport of compressed and liquid oxygen, which carries an inherent risk of rupture or other accidents with the potential to cause substantial loss.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s operations are subject to the many hazards inherent in the transportation of medical gas products and compressed and liquid oxygen, including ruptures, leaks and fires. These risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage and may result in curtailment or suspension of AdaptHealth\u2019s related operations. If a significant accident or event occurs, it could adversely affect AdaptHealth\u2019s business, financial position and results of operations. Additionally, corrective action plans, fines or other sanctions may be levied by government regulators who oversee transportation of hazardous materials such as compressed or liquid oxygen.\nAdaptHealth provides a significant number of patients with oxygen-based therapy, and from time to time, AdaptHealth has operated medical gas facilities in several states subject to federal and state regulatory requirements. AdaptHealth\u2019s medical gas facilities and operations are subject to extensive regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) and other federal and state authorities. The FDA regulates medical gases, including medical oxygen, pursuant to its authority under the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Among other requirements, the FDA\u2019s current Good Manufacturing Practice (\u201ccGMP\u201d) regulations impose certain quality control, documentation and recordkeeping requirements on the receipt, processing and distribution of medical gas. Further, in each such state, its medical gas facilities would be subject to regulation under state health and safety laws, which vary from state to state. The FDA and state authorities conduct periodic, unannounced inspections at medical gas facilities to assess compliance with the cGMP and other regulations, and AdaptHealth expends significant time, money and resources in an effort to achieve substantial compliance with the cGMP regulations and other federal and state law requirements at each of its medical gas facilities. AdaptHealth also complies with the FDA\u2019s requirement for medical gas providers to register their sites with the agency. There can be no assurance, however, that these efforts will be successful and that AdaptHealth\u2019s medical gas facilities will maintain compliance with federal and state law regulations. Failure by AdaptHealth to maintain regulatory compliance at its medical gas facilities could result in enforcement action, including warning letters, fines, product recalls or seizures, temporary or permanent injunctions, or suspensions in operations at one or more locations, and civil or criminal penalties which would materially harm its business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity.\nAdaptHealth is subject, directly or indirectly, to United States federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and false claims laws and regulations. Prosecutions under such laws have increased in recent years and AdaptHealth may become subject to such litigation. If AdaptHealth is unable to or has not fully complied with such laws, it could face substantial penalties.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s operations are subject to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal Stark Law and the federal False Claims Act. These laws may impact, among other things, AdaptHealth\u2019s sales, marketing and education programs.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Several courts have interpreted the statute\u2019s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and, despite a series of narrow safe harbors, prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Penalties for violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nThe federal Ethics in Patient Referrals Act of 1989, commonly known as the \u201cStark Law,\u201d prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, physician referrals of Medicare and Medicaid patients to an entity providing certain \u201cdesignated health services\u201d if the physician or an immediate family member has any financial relationship with the entity. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity receiving the referral from billing any good or service furnished pursuant to an unlawful referral. Various states have corollary laws to the Stark Law, including laws that require physicians to disclose any financial interest they may have with a healthcare provider to their patients when referring patients to that provider. Both the scope and exceptions for such laws vary from state to state.\nThe federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing, or causing to be filed, a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government. Suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as qui tam actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The frequency of filing qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of medical device, pharmaceutical and healthcare companies to have to defend a False Claim Act action. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim. Various states have also enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.\nFrom time to time, AdaptHealth has been and is involved in various governmental audits, investigations and reviews related to its operations. Reviews and investigations can lead to government actions, resulting in the assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way AdaptHealth conducts business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other government programs. If AdaptHealth fails to comply with applicable laws, regulations and rules, its financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, becoming subject to these governmental investigations, audits and reviews may result in substantial costs as AdaptHealth cooperates with the government authorities, regardless of whether the particular investigation, audit or review leads to the identification of underlying issues.\nAdaptHealth is unable to predict whether it could be subject to actions under any of these laws, or the impact of such actions. If AdaptHealth is found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or other applicable state and federal fraud and abuse laws, AdaptHealth may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare reimbursement programs and the curtailment or restructuring of its operations.\nFailure by AdaptHealth to maintain required licenses and accreditation could impact its operations.\nAdaptHealth is required to maintain a significant number of state and/or federal licenses for its operations and facilities. Certain employees are required to maintain licenses in the states in which they practice. AdaptHealth manages the facility licensing function centrally. In addition, individual clinical employees are responsible for obtaining, maintaining and renewing their professional licenses, and AdaptHealth has processes in place designed to notify branch or pharmacy managers of renewal dates for the clinical employees under their supervision. State and federal licensing requirements are complex and often open to subjective interpretation by various regulatory agencies. Accurate licensure is also a critical threshold issue for the Medicare enrollment and the Medicare competitive bidding program. From time to time, AdaptHealth may also become subject to new or different licensing requirements due to legislative or regulatory requirements developments or changes in its business, and such developments may cause AdaptHealth to make further changes in its business, the results of which may be material. Although AdaptHealth believes it has appropriate systems in place to monitor licensure, violations of licensing requirements may occur and failure by AdaptHealth to acquire or maintain appropriate licensure for its operations, facilities and clinicians could result in interruptions in its operations, refunds to state and/or federal payors, sanctions or fines or the inability to serve Medicare beneficiaries in competitive bidding markets which could adversely impact AdaptHealth\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nAccreditation is required by most of AdaptHealth\u2019s managed care payors and is a mandatory requirement for all Medicare DMEPOS providers. If AdaptHealth or any of its branches lose accreditation, or if any of its new branches are unable to become accredited, such failure to maintain accreditation or become accredited could adversely impact AdaptHealth\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nCompliance with regulations under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH Act\u201d) and related rules relating to the transmission, security and privacy of health information could impose additional significant costs on AdaptHealth\u2019s operations.\nNumerous federal and state laws and regulations addressing patient privacy and consumer privacy, including HIPAA and the HITECH Act, govern the collection, dissemination, security, use and confidentiality of patient-identifiable health information or personal information. HIPAA and the HITECH Act require AdaptHealth to comply with standards for the use and disclosure of health information within AdaptHealth and with third parties. HIPAA and the HITECH Act also include standards for common healthcare electronic transactions and code sets, such as claims information, plan eligibility, payment information and the use of electronic signatures, and privacy and electronic security of individually identifiable health information.\nHIPAA requires healthcare providers, including AdaptHealth, in addition to health plans and clearinghouses, to develop and maintain policies and procedures with respect to protected health information that is used or disclosed. The HITECH Act expands the notification requirement for breaches of patient-identifiable health information, restricts certain disclosures and sales of patient identifiable health information and provides a tiered system for civil monetary penalties for HIPAA violations.\nIn addition, under the Federal CAN-SPAM Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule and Medicare regulations, AdaptHealth is limited in the ways in which it can market and service its products and services by use of email or telephone marketing. If AdaptHealth does not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to patient health information, it could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions. New health information standards, whether implemented pursuant to HIPAA, the HITECH Act, congressional action or otherwise, could have a significant effect on the manner in which AdaptHealth handles healthcare-related data and communicates with payors, and the cost of complying with these standards could be significant.\nAdaptHealth is highly dependent upon senior management; failure by AdaptHealth to attract and retain key members of senior management could adversely affect AdaptHealth\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nAdaptHealth is highly dependent on the performance and continued efforts of its senior management team. AdaptHealth\u2019s future success is dependent on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified executive officers and\nsenior management. Any inability to manage AdaptHealth\u2019s operations effectively could adversely impact its financial condition and results of operations.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s reliance on relatively few suppliers for the majority of its patient service equipment and supplies could adversely affect AdaptHealth\u2019s ability to operate.\nAdaptHealth currently relies on a relatively small number of suppliers to provide it with the majority of its patient service equipment and supplies. Significant price increases, or disruptions in the ability to obtain such equipment and supplies from existing suppliers, may force AdaptHealth to use alternative suppliers. Additionally, any new excise taxes imposed on manufacturers of certain medical equipment could be passed on to customers, such as AdaptHealth. Such manufacturers may be forced to make other changes to their products or manufacturing processes that are unacceptable to AdaptHealth, resulting in a need to change suppliers. Any change in suppliers AdaptHealth uses could cause delays in the delivery of such products and possible losses in revenue, which could adversely affect AdaptHealth\u2019s results of operations. In addition, alternative suppliers may not be available, or may not provide their products and services at similar or favorable prices. If AdaptHealth cannot obtain the patient service equipment and supplies it currently uses, or alternatives at similar or favorable prices, AdaptHealth\u2019s ability to provide such products may be severely impacted, which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity. In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus began to impact the population of China, where several of AdaptHealth\u2019s suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities are located. In China, certain businesses have suspended or terminated operations, a portion of the population has been subject to self-imposed or mandatory quarantines and economic activity has slowed. While the closures and limitations on movement in China are expected to be temporary, the potential supply chain disruption or its duration, and its related financial impact, cannot be estimated at this time. Should the closures and limitations on movement continue for an extended period of time, the impact on AdaptHealth\u2019s supply chain could materially and adversely affect AdaptHealth\u2019s business and results of operations.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s strategic growth plan, which involves the acquisition of other companies, may not succeed.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s strategic plan calls for significant growth in its business over the next several years through an increase in its density in select markets where it is established as well as the expansion of its geographic footprint into new markets. This growth would place significant demands on AdaptHealth\u2019s management team, systems, internal controls and financial and professional resources. As a result, AdaptHealth could be required to incur expenses for hiring additional qualified personnel, retaining professionals to assist in developing the appropriate control systems and expanding AdaptHealth\u2019s information technology infrastructure. If AdaptHealth is unable to effectively manage growth, its financial results could be adversely impacted.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s strategic plan also contemplates continued growth from future acquisitions of home medical equipment providers. AdaptHealth may face increased competition for attractive acquisition candidates, which may limit the number of acquisition opportunities available to AdaptHealth or lead to the payment of higher prices for its acquisitions. Without successful acquisitions, AdaptHealth\u2019s future growth rate could decline. In addition, AdaptHealth cannot guarantee that any future acquisitions, if consummated, will result in further growth.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s strategic plan contemplates successful integration of acquired home medical equipment providers with AdaptHealth\u2019s existing business, including reduction in operating expenses with respect to the acquired companies. Integrating an acquisition could be expensive and time-consuming and could disrupt AdaptHealth\u2019s ongoing business, negatively affect cash flow and distract management and other key personnel from day-to-day operations. AdaptHealth may not be able to combine successfully the operations of recently acquired companies with its operations, and, even if such integration is accomplished, AdaptHealth may never realize the potential benefits of such acquisition. The integration of acquisitions requires significant attention from management, may impose substantial demands on AdaptHealth\u2019s operations or other projects and may impose challenges on us including, but not limited to, consistencies in business standards, procedures, policies and business cultures. There can be no assurance that any future acquisitions, if consummated, will result in further growth.\nSpecific integration risks relating to the acquisition of other companies by AdaptHealth may include:\n\u00b7\ndifficulties related to combining previously separate businesses into a single unit, including patient transitions, product and service offerings, distribution and operational capabilities and business cultures;\n\u00b7\navailability of financing to the extent needed to fund acquisitions;\n\u00b7\ncustomer loss and other general business disruption;\n\u00b7\nmanaging the integration process while completing other independent acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from day-to-day operations;\n\u00b7\nassumption of liabilities of an acquired business, including unforeseen or contingent liabilities or liabilities in excess of the amounts estimated;\n\u00b7\nfailure to realize anticipated benefits and synergies, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements;\n\u00b7\npotentially substantial costs and expenses associated with acquisitions and dispositions;\n\u00b7\nfailure to retain and motivate key employees;\n\u00b7\ncoordinating research and development activities to enhance the introduction of new products and services;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in establishing and applying AdaptHealth\u2019s internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures to an acquired business;\n\u00b7\nobtaining necessary regulatory licenses and payor-specific approvals, which may impact the timing of when AdaptHealth is to bill and collect for services rendered;\n\u00b7\nAdaptHealth\u2019s ability to transition patients in a timely manner may impact AdaptHealth\u2019s ability to collect amounts for services rendered;\n\u00b7\nAdaptHealth\u2019s estimates for revenue accruals during the integration of acquisitions may require adjustments in future periods as the transition of patient information is finalized; and\n\u00b7\ndelays in obtaining new government and commercial payor identification numbers for acquired branches, resulting in a slowdown and/or loss of associated revenue.\nIn addition, AdaptHealth faces competition for acquisition candidates and, which may limit the number of acquisition opportunities available to AdaptHealth or lead to the payment of higher prices for its acquisitions. There can be no assurance that AdaptHealth will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities in the future or that any such opportunities, if identified, will be consummated on favorable terms, if at all. Without successful acquisitions, AdaptHealth\u2019s future growth rate could decline.\nWhile AdaptHealth conducts due diligence in connection with any acquisition opportunity, there may be risks or liabilities that such due diligence efforts fail to discover that are not disclosed to AdaptHealth or that AdaptHealth inadequately assesses. The failure to timely identify any material liabilities associated with any acquisitions could adversely impact AdaptHealth\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIf AdaptHealth were required to write down all or part of its goodwill its net earnings and net worth could be materially adversely affected.\nGoodwill represents a significant portion of AdaptHealth\u2019s assets. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. For example, if our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet, it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired. If, as part of our annual review of goodwill, we are required to write down all or a significant part of AdaptHealth\u2019s goodwill our net earnings and net worth could be materially adversely affected, which could affect our flexibility to obtain additional financing. In addition, if our assumptions used in preparing our valuations for purposes of impairment testing differ materially from actual future results, we may record impairment charges in the future and our financial results may be materially adversely affected. AdaptHealth had $266.8 million and $202.4 million of goodwill recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. It is not possible at this time to determine if there will be any future impairment charge, or if there is, whether such charges would be material.\nAdaptHealth may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to cover required payments or meet operating covenants under its long-term debt and long-term operating leases.\nFailure to generate sufficient cash flow to cover required payments or meet operating covenants under AdaptHealth\u2019s long-term debt and long-term operating leases could result in defaults under such agreements and cross-defaults under other debt or operating lease arrangements, which could harm its operating subsidiaries. AdaptHealth may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to cover required interest, principal and lease payments. In addition, AdaptHealth\u2019s outstanding credit facility contains restrictive covenants and requires AdaptHealth to maintain or satisfy specified coverage tests. These restrictions and operating covenants include, among other things, requirements with respect to total leverage ratios and fixed charge coverage ratios. These restrictions, together with the restrictive covenants included in promissory notes with certain affiliates of BlueMountain Capital Management, LLC, may interfere with AdaptHealth\u2019s ability to obtain additional advances under its existing credit facility or to obtain new financing or to engage in other business activities, which may inhibit AdaptHealth\u2019s ability to grow its business and increase revenue. In addition, failure by AdaptHealth to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of its debt.\nAdaptHealth may need additional capital to fund its operating subsidiaries and finance its growth, and AdaptHealth may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms, or at all, which may limit its ability to grow.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s ability to maintain and enhance its operating subsidiaries and equipment to meet regulatory standards, operate efficiently and remain competitive in its markets requires AdaptHealth to commit substantial resources to continued investment in its affiliated facilities and equipment. Additionally, the continued expansion of its business through the acquisition of existing facilities, expansion of existing facilities and construction of new facilities may require additional capital, particularly if AdaptHealth were to accelerate its acquisition and expansion plans. Financing may not be available or may be available only on terms that are not favorable. In addition, some of AdaptHealth\u2019s outstanding indebtedness restrict, among other things, its ability to incur additional debt. If AdaptHealth is unable to raise additional funds or obtain additional funds on acceptable terms, it may have to delay or abandon some or all of its growth strategies. Further, if additional funds are raised through the issuance of additional equity securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be diluted. Any newly issued equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the Common Stock.\nChanges in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates on AdaptHealth\u2019s outstanding variable rate indebtedness.\nCertain of AdaptHealth\u2019s indebtedness, including LIBOR Rate Loans under its credit facility, bears interest at variable interest rates that use LIBOR as a benchmark rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent proposals for reform and, on July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has begun publishing a Secured\nOvernight Funding Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), which is intended to replace U.S. dollar LIBOR, and central banks in several other jurisdictions have also announced plans for alternative reference rates for other currencies. These reforms may cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or to disappear entirely. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted but may result in an increase in the interest cost of AdaptHealth\u2019s variable rate indebtedness. In the event that LIBOR is no longer available as a reference rate or is replaced by SOFR in the future, AdaptHealth\u2019s credit facility permits its lenders, in good faith, to unilaterally suspend maintaining LIBOR Rate Loans under the credit facility and to adopt a new rate, such as SOFR. As a result, AdaptHealth may need to renegotiate its outstanding indebtedness or incur other indebtedness, and the phase-out of LIBOR may negatively impact the terms of such indebtedness. In addition, the overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Disruption in the financial market could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPolitical and economic conditions, including significant global or regional developments such as economic and political events, international conflicts, natural disasters, and public health crises that are out of AdaptHealth\u2019s control, could adversely affect its revenue, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s business can be affected by a number of factors that are beyond its control, such as general geopolitical, economic and business conditions, financial services market conditions, and general political and economic developments, including slower economic growth, disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns in the form of either contained or widespread recessionary conditions, inflation, elevated unemployment levels, sluggish or uneven economic recovery, government actions impacting trade agreements including the imposition of trade restrictions such as tariffs and retaliatory counter measures, government deficit reduction, natural and other disasters and public health crises affecting the operations of AdaptHealth or its customers or suppliers. Any Medicare, Medicaid or third-party payor reimbursement reductions as a result of such factors could adversely impact AdaptHealth\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity. Turmoil in the financial markets, including in the capital and credit markets, and any uncertainty over its breadth, depth and duration may put pressure on the global economy and could have a negative effect on AdaptHealth\u2019s business. Further, historical worldwide financial and credit turmoil could reduce the availability of liquidity and credit to fund the continuation and expansion of business operations worldwide. The shortage of liquidity and credit combined with substantial losses in worldwide equity markets could cause an economic recession in the United States or worldwide. If financial markets in the United States, Europe and Asia experience extreme disruption, including, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others, governments may take unprecedented actions intended to address extreme market conditions that may include severely restricted credit and declines in real estate values. If conditions in the global economy, U.S. economy or other key vertical or geographic markets are weak or uncertain, AdaptHealth could experience material adverse impacts on its revenue, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf AdaptHealth\u2019s subsidiary fails to comply with the terms of its Corporate Integrity Agreement, it could be subjected to substantial monetary penalties or suspension or termination from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nBraden Partners, L.P. (\u201cBP\u201d), d/b/a Pacific Pulmonary Services (\u201cPPS\u201d), which was acquired by AdaptHealth in May 2018, entered into a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement (\u201cCIA\u201d) with the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (the \u201cOIG-HHS\u201d), effective March 31, 2017, concurrent with the execution of a settlement agreement with the United States, acting through the DOJ and on behalf of the OIG-HHS. The CIA imposes certain compliance, auditing (including by an independent review organization), self-reporting and training requirements with which BP must comply. If BP fails to comply with the terms of its CIA, it could be subjected to substantial monetary penalties and/or suspension or exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Any such suspension, exclusion or termination would result in the revocation or termination of contracts and/or licenses and potentially have a material adverse effect on the results of BP\u2019s operations. The imposition of monetary penalties and/or termination of contracts with respect to BP could adversely affect AdaptHealth\u2019s profitability and financial condition. The CIA has a five-year term which expires in April 2022. In connection with the acquisition and integration of PPS by AdaptHealth, the OIG-HSS confirmed that the requirements of the CIA imposed upon PPS would only apply to the\noperations of BP and therefore no operations of any other AdaptHealth affiliate are subject to the requirements of the CIA following the acquisition.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s current insurance program may expose it to unexpected costs and negatively affect its business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly if it incurs losses not covered by its insurance or if claims or losses differ from its estimates.\nThere is an inherent risk of liability in the provision of healthcare services. As participants in the healthcare industry, AdaptHealth may periodically be subject to lawsuits, some of which may involve large claims and significant costs to defend, such as mass tort or other class actions. Although AdaptHealth\u2019s insurance coverage reflects deductibles, self-insured retentions, limits of liability and similar provisions that it believes are reasonable based on its operations, the coverage under its insurance programs may not be adequate to protect it in all circumstances. AdaptHealth\u2019s insurance policies contain exclusions and conditions that could have a materially adverse impact on AdaptHealth\u2019s ability to receive indemnification thereunder, as well as customary sub-limits for particular types of losses. Additionally, insurance companies that currently insure companies in AdaptHealth\u2019s industry may cease to do so, may change the coverage provided or may substantially increase premiums in the future. The incurrence of losses and liabilities that exceed AdaptHealth\u2019s available coverage, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdaptHealth currently self-insures a significant portion of expected losses under its workers\u2019 compensation, automobile liability and employee health insurance programs and, to offset negative insurance market trends, AdaptHealth may elect to increase its self-insurance coverage, accept higher deductibles or reduce the amount of coverage. Unanticipated changes in any applicable actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying its liabilities for these losses could result in materially different expenses than expected under these programs, which could have a material adverse effect on AdaptHealth\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if AdaptHealth experiences a greater number of these losses than it anticipates, it could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdaptHealth currently outsources, and from time to time in the future may outsource, a portion of its internal business functions to third-party providers. Outsourcing these functions has significant risks, and AdaptHealth\u2019s failure to manage these risks successfully could materially adversely affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAdaptHealth currently, and from time to time in the future, may outsource portions of its internal business functions, including billing and administrative functions relating to revenue cycle management, to third-party providers in India, the Philippines and Central America. These third-party providers may not comply on a timely basis with all of AdaptHealth\u2019s requirements, or may not provide AdaptHealth with an acceptable level of service. In addition, AdaptHealth\u2019s reliance on third-party providers could have significant negative consequences, including significant disruptions in its operations and significantly increased costs to undertake its operations, either of which could damage AdaptHealth\u2019s relationships with its customers. In addition, AdaptHealth\u2019s outsourced functions may be negatively impacted by any number of factors, including political unrest; social unrest; terrorism; war; vandalism; currency fluctuations; changes to the law of India, the Philippines, the United States or any of the states or other jurisdictions in which AdaptHealth does business or outsources operations; or increases in the cost of labor and supplies in India, the Philippines or Central America or any other jurisdiction in which AdaptHealth outsources any portion of its internal business functions. AdaptHealth\u2019s outsourced operations may also be affected by trade restrictions, such as tariffs or other trade controls. As a result of its outsourcing activities, it may also be more difficult for AdaptHealth to recruit and retain qualified employees for its business needs at any time. AdaptHealth\u2019s failure to successfully outsource certain of its business functions could materially adversely affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nOur only significant assets are the ownership of a majority interest in AdaptHealth Holdings, and such ownership may not be sufficient to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations or to pay any dividends on our Class A Common Stock.\nWe have no direct operations and no significant assets other than the ownership of a majority of the economic and voting interests in AdaptHealth Holdings. We depend on AdaptHealth Holdings and its subsidiaries for distributions, loans and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations or to pay any dividends with respect to our Class A Common Stock. Legal and contractual restrictions in agreements governing the indebtedness of AdaptHealth Holdings and its subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from AdaptHealth Holdings. The earnings from, or other available assets of, AdaptHealth Holdings and its subsidiaries may not be sufficient to enable us to satisfy our financial obligations or pay any dividends on our Class A Common Stock. AdaptHealth Holdings is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is generally not subject to entity-level U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income is allocated to holders of units of AdaptHealth Holdings (\u201cAdaptHealth Units\u201d), including us. As a result, we generally will incur taxes on our allocable share of any net taxable income generated by AdaptHealth Holdings. Under the terms of the Fifth Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of AdaptHealth Holdings, AdaptHealth Holdings is obligated to make tax distributions to holders of AdaptHealth Units, including us, except to the extent such distributions would render AdaptHealth Holdings insolvent or are otherwise prohibited by law or the terms of AdaptHealth\u2019s credit facility. In addition to our tax obligations, we also incur expenses related to our operations and our interests in AdaptHealth Holdings, including costs and expenses of being a publicly-traded company, all of which could be significant. To the extent that we require funds and AdaptHealth Holdings or its subsidiaries are restricted from making distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of their financing arrangements, or are otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our ability to pay our income taxes when due.\nWe are required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for certain tax benefits we may claim, and the amounts of such payments could be significant.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement, which we entered into at the Closing with the Blocker Sellers and the owners of units of AdaptHealth Holdings prior to the Closing other than the Blocker Companies (the \u201cNon-Blocker AdaptHealth Members\u201d and, collectively with the Blocker Sellers, the \u201cTRA Holders\u201d), generally provides for the payment by us to the Blocker Sellers of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that we actually realize (or are deemed to realize in certain circumstances) in periods after the Closing as a result of: (i) certain tax attributes of Access Point Medical, Inc. existing prior to the Business Combination; (ii) certain increases in tax basis resulting from exchanges of AdaptHealth Units; (iii) imputed interest deemed to be paid by us as a result of payments we make under the Tax Receivable Agreement; and (iv) certain increases in tax basis resulting from payments we make under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of these cash savings. The amount of the cash payments that we may be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement could be significant and is dependent upon significant future events and assumptions, including the timing of the exchanges of AdaptHealth Units, the price of our Class A Common Stock at the time of each exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable transactions and the amount of the exchanging TRA Holder\u2019s tax basis in its AdaptHealth Units at the time of the relevant exchange. The amount of such cash payments is also based on assumptions as to the amount and timing of taxable income we generate in the future, the U.S. federal income tax rate then applicable and the portion of our payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that constitute interest or give rise to depreciable or amortizable tax basis. Moreover, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine, which tax reporting positions are subject to challenge by taxing authorities. We are dependent on distributions from AdaptHealth Holdings to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and we cannot guarantee that such distributions will be made in sufficient amounts or at the times needed to enable us to make our required payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, or at all. Any payments made by us to the TRA Holders under the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us. To the extent that we are unable to make timely payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, the unpaid amounts will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid by us. Nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and therefore, may accelerate\npayments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are also not conditioned upon the TRA Holders maintaining a continued ownership interest in AdaptHealth Holdings or us.\nIn certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits, if any, we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement provides that if we breach any of our material obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, if we undergo a change of control or if, at any time, we elect an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement, then the Tax Receivable Agreement will terminate and our obligations, or our successor\u2019s obligations, to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement would accelerate and become immediately due and payable. The amount due and payable in those circumstances is determined based on certain assumptions, including an assumption that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize all potential future tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. We may need to incur debt to finance payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement to the extent our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise.\nAs a result of the foregoing, (i) we could be required to make cash payments to the TRA Holders that are greater than the specified percentage of the actual benefits we ultimately realize in respect of the tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement, and (ii) we would be required to make a cash payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits that are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreement, which payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of such future tax benefits. In these situations, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination, or other changes of control due to the additional transaction costs a potential acquirer may attribute to satisfying such obligations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nWe will not be reimbursed for any payments made to TRA Holders under the Tax Receivable Agreement in the event that any tax benefits are disallowed.\nWe will not be reimbursed for any cash payments previously made to the TRA Holders pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement if any tax benefits initially claimed by us are subsequently challenged by a taxing authority and are ultimately disallowed. Instead, any excess cash payments made by us to a TRA Holder will be netted against any future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement. However, a challenge to any tax benefits initially claimed by us may not arise for a number of years following the initial time of such payment or, even if challenged early, such excess cash payment may be greater than the amount of future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement and, as a result, there might not be future cash payments from which to net against. The applicable U.S. federal income tax rules are complex and factual in nature, and there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service or a court will not disagree with our tax reporting positions. As a result, it is possible that we could make cash payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that are substantially greater than our actual cash tax savings.\nCertain of the TRA Holders have substantial control over us, and their interests, along with the interests of other TRA Holders, in our business may conflict with the interests of our stockholders.\nThe TRA Holders may receive payments from us under the Tax Receivable Agreement upon any redemption or exchange of their AdaptHealth Units, including the issuance of shares of our Class A Common Stock upon any such redemption or exchange. As a result, the interests of the TRA Holders may conflict with the interests of holders of our Class A Common Stock. For example, the TRA Holders may have different tax positions from us, which could influence their decisions regarding whether and when to dispose of assets, whether and when to incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, especially in light of the existence of the Tax Receivable Agreement, and whether and when we should terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement and accelerate our obligations thereunder. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration tax or other considerations of TRA Holders even in situations where no similar considerations are relevant to us.\nWe may not be able to timely and effectively implement controls and procedures required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that are applicable to us.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. To comply with the requirements of being a public company, we are required to provide attestation on internal controls, and we may need to undertake various actions, such as implementing additional internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff. The standards required for a public company under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are significantly more stringent than those that were required of AdaptHealth Holdings as a privately held company. Management may not be able to effectively and timely implement controls and procedures that adequately respond to the increased regulatory compliance and reporting requirements that are applicable to us after the Business Combination. If we are not able to implement the additional requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we may not be able to assess whether our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, which may subject us to adverse regulatory consequences and could harm investor confidence and the market price of our Class A Common Stock. Further, as an emerging growth company, our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until the date we are no longer an emerging growth company. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event that it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating.\nIn connection with the audit of AdaptHealth\u2019s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were certain controls over financial reporting relating to the timeliness of our review controls over non-routine transactions that did not operate as designed. AdaptHealth continues to be actively engaged in the development and implementation of its remediation plan to address such material weakness, including:\n\u00b7\nimplementation of processes to improve overall efficiency and accuracy of accounting;\n\u00b7\nassignment of dedicated and experienced technical resources, including engaging a third-party consultant to assist management, with its responsibility of strengthening corporate oversight over financial reporting and enhancing controls associated with complex accounting matters; and\n\u00b7\nhiring additional qualified personnel and continue to evaluate the adequacy of our accounting personnel staffing level.\nThis remediation plan is intended to ensure that the key controls over the financial reporting oversight process are operating effectively and are sustainable.\nIn addition, our management and other personnel will need to continue to devote a substantial amount of time to compliance initiatives applicable to public companies, including compliance with Section 404 and the evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting within the prescribed timeframe. AdaptHealth is in the process of evaluating the adequacy of its accounting personnel staffing level and other matters related to internal controls over financial reporting. AdaptHealth may discover additional deficiencies in existing systems and controls that it may not be able to remediate in an efficient or timely manner.\nCertain of our principal stockholders have significant influence over us.\nEntities affiliated with Deerfield Management Company, L.P. (collectively, \u201cDeerfield Management\u201d) collectively beneficially own approximately 26.14% of our Class A Common Stock, assuming (i) the exchange of 31,063,799 AdaptHealth Units together with the same number of shares of Class B Common Stock for shares of Class A Common Stock and (ii) the exercise of 1,640,981 private placement warrants and 833,333 public warrants held by Deerfield Management. Everest Trust beneficially owns approximately 21.717% of our Class A Common Stock, assuming (i) the exchange of 31,063,799 AdaptHealth Units together with the same number of shares of Class B Common Stock for shares of Class A Common Stock and (ii) the exercise of 665,628 private placement warrants held by\nClifton Bay Offshore Investments L.P. and 41,473 private placement warrants held by Quadrant Management, Inc. As long as Deerfield Management and/or Everest Trust own or control a significant percentage of our outstanding voting power, they will have the ability to significantly influence all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and the size of our board of directors, any amendment to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or the approval of any merger or other significant corporate transaction, including a sale of substantially all of our assets.\nThe interests of Deerfield Management and/or Everest Trust may not align with the interests of our other stockholders. Each of Deerfield Management and Everest Trust is in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Each of Deerfield Management and Everest Trust may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our stockholders and our directors, including any who were designated by any of our stockholders, other than any such persons who are employees of us or any of our subsidiaries, do not have any obligation to offer to us any corporate opportunity of which he or she may become aware prior to offering such opportunities to other entities with which they may be affiliated, subject to certain limited exceptions.\nWe will continue to incur significant increased expenses and administrative burdens as a result of being a public company, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will continue to face increased legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses as a public company that AdaptHealth Holdings did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act), including the requirements of Section 404, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations promulgated and to be promulgated thereunder, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the securities exchanges, impose additional reporting and other obligations on public companies. Compliance with public company requirements increases costs and makes certain activities more time-consuming. A number of those requirements require us to carry out activities AdaptHealth had not prior to the Business Combination. In addition, additional expenses associated with SEC reporting requirements will continue to be incurred. Furthermore, if any issues in complying with those requirements are identified (for example, if the auditors identify a material weakness or significant deficiency in the internal control over financial reporting), we could incur additional costs rectifying those issues, and the existence of those issues could adversely affect our reputation or investor perceptions of us. It may also be more expensive to obtain director and officer liability insurance. Risks associated with our status as a public company may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on the board of directors or as executive officers. The additional reporting and other obligations imposed by these rules and regulations will increase legal and financial compliance costs and the costs of related legal, accounting and administrative activities. These increased costs will require us to divert a significant amount of money that could otherwise be used to expand the business and achieve strategic objectives. Advocacy efforts by stockholders and third parties may also prompt additional changes in governance and reporting requirements, which could further increase costs.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s management has limited experience in operating a public company.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s executive officers and certain directors have limited experience in the management of a publicly traded company. AdaptHealth\u2019s management team may not successfully or effectively manage its transition to a public company that is subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under federal securities laws. Their limited experience in dealing with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies could be a significant disadvantage in that it is likely that an increasing amount of their time may be devoted to these activities which will result in less time being devoted to the management and growth of the company. It is possible that we will be required to expand our employee base and hire additional employees to support our operations as a public company, which will increase our operating costs in future periods.\nBecause we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our Class A Common Stock for the foreseeable future, our stockholders may not receive any return on investment unless they sell their Class A Common Stock for a price greater than that which they paid for it.\nWe may retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion and debt repayment and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends as a public company in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may be limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. As a result, our stockholders may not receive any return on an investment in our Class A Common Stock unless they sell our Class A Common Stock for a price greater than that which they paid for it.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to comply with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq.\nOur Class A Common Stock is currently listed on Nasdaq. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to meet Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements with respect to our Class A Common Stock. If our Class A Common Stock is delisted, there could be limited availability of market quotations for the Class A Common Stock and reduced liquidity in trading. Our public warrants were formerly listed on Nasdaq; however, on November 27, 2019, we received a letter from Nasdaq stating that our public warrants failed to meet the Nasdaq Capital Market\u2019s round lot holder requirement. Our public warrants were suspended from trading on Nasdaq on December 6, 2019 and subsequently delisted. Upon suspension of trading on Nasdaq, our public warrants began trading on the over-the-counter market. Although we anticipate that our Class A Common Stock, if delisted from Nasdaq, would be eligible for quotation and trading on the over-the-counter market, there can be no assurance that trading would be commenced or maintained on the over-the-counter market for our Class A Common Stock.\nIn addition, if we failed to meet Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements with respect to our Class A Common Stock, in addition to reduced liquidity, we and our stockholders could face significant material consequences including:\n\u00b7\na determination that our Class A Common Stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our Class A Common Stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\u00b7\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u00b7\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as \u201ccovered securities.\u201d Because our Class A Common Stock is listed on Nasdaq, it is a covered security. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our Class A Common Stock, if we were no longer listed on Nasdaq, our Class A Common Stock would not be a covered security and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our Class A Common Stock.\nA significant portion of our total outstanding Class A Common Stock is restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the near future. This could cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of Class A Common Stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our Class A Common Stock. After the Business Combination:\n\u00b7\ncertain persons collectively own 3,672,500 shares of Class A Common Stock and 2,643,333 private placement warrants distributed to them by Deerfield/RAB Ventures LLC (our \u201cSponsor\u201d) in connection with its\ndissolution, subject to restrictions on transfer under the terms of a letter agreement entered into by our Sponsor at the time of our initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d);\n\u00b7\n38,290,298 shares of Class A Common Stock which were either issued or may be issued upon the exchange of AdaptHealth Units are subject to restrictions on transfer under the terms of the Lock-up Agreements; and\n\u00b7\nDeerfield and Richard Barasch collectively own 12,500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock that are subject to restrictions on transfer under the terms of the Amended and Restated Subscription Agreement entered into on October 15, 2019 between the Company, Deerfield and RAB Ventures (DFB) LLC.\nWe may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants.\nOur warrants are issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 65% of the then-outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment. Although our ability to amend the terms of the warrants with the consent of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant.\nWe may redeem unexpired public warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to warrantholders, thereby making their public warrants worthless.\nWe have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant; provided that the last reported sales price of our Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date we send the notice of such redemption to the warrant holders. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force warrantholders (i) to exercise their warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for them to do so, (ii) to sell their warrants at the then-current market price when they might otherwise wish to hold their warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of their warrants. In addition, we may redeem the public warrants after they become exercisable for a number of shares of Class A Common Stock determined based on the redemption date and the fair market value of our Class A Common Stock. Any such redemption may have similar consequences to a cash redemption described above. In addition, such redemption may occur at a time when the warrants are \u201cout-of-the-money,\u201d in which case warrantholders would lose any potential embedded value from a subsequent increase in the value of the Common Stock had their warrants remained outstanding.\nIn addition, we may redeem the public warrants after they become exercisable for a number of shares of Class A Common Stock determined based on the redemption date and the fair market value of our Class A Common Stock. Any such redemption may have similar consequences to a cash redemption described above. In addition, such redemption may occur at a time when the warrants are \u201cout-of-the-money,\u201d in which case warrantholders would lose any potential embedded value from a subsequent increase in the value of the Class A Common Stock had their warrants remained outstanding. None of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by our Sponsor or its permitted transferees.\nOur warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A Common Stock.\nWe issued warrants to purchase 8,333,333 shares of our Class A Common Stock as part of the units offered in our IPO and, simultaneously with the closing of our IPO, we issued in a private placement an aggregate of 4,333,333 private placement warrants, each exercisable to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock at $11.50 per share. To the extent such warrants are exercised, additional shares of our Class A Common Stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to our stockholders and increase the number of shares of Class A Common Stock eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market or the fact that such warrants may be exercised could adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock.\nThe JOBS Act permits \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d like us to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we plan to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, including (i) the exemption from the auditor attestation requirements with respect to internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) the exemptions from say-on-pay, say-on-frequency and say-on-golden parachute voting requirements and (iii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which the market value of our Class A Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30 of that fiscal year, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1 billion or more during such fiscal year, (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.07 billion in non-convertible debt in the prior three-year period or (iv) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common stock in the IPO, which would be December 31, 2023. AdaptHealth had revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 of approximately $529.6 million. If we continue to expand our business through acquisitions and/or continue to grow revenues organically, we may cease to be an emerging growth company prior to December 31, 2023.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as we are an emerging growth company. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the same time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. Investors may find our Class A Common Stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions, which may result in a less active trading market for our Class A Common Stock and its stock price may be more volatile.\nWe are also currently a \u201csmaller reporting company.\u201d In the event that we are still considered a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d at such time as we cease being an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d the disclosure we will be required to provide in our SEC filings will increase, but will still be less than it would be if we were not considered either an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d or a \u201csmaller reporting company.\u201d Specifically, similar to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d \u201csmaller reporting companies\u201d are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d or \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and, to the extent enforceable, the federal district courts of the United States of America be the\nexclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, other than any claim to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or other claim for which federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction, that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against directors, officers and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and, if brought outside of the State of Delaware, the stockholder bringing such suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder\u2019s counsel. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation further provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. These provisions may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. If a court were to find either exclusive forum provision in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business. For example, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware determined in December 2018 that the exclusive forum provision of federal district courts of the United States of America for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act is not enforceable. However, this decision may be reviewed and ultimately overturned by the Delaware Supreme Court. If the Court of Chancery\u2019s decision were to be overturned, we would enforce the federal district court exclusive forum provision in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation.", "PERMNO": 17684, "SIC": 5047, "TIC": "AHCO"}
