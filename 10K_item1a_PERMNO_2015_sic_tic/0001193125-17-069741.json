RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks described below, together with the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nThe following sets forth certain risks and uncertainties related to us, including risks and uncertainties related to the Otic Transaction and risks and uncertainties to which Tokai, as an independent company, is subject, and will continue to be subject, to if the Otic Transaction is not consummated.\nRisks Related to our Proposed Transaction with Otic\nOur strategic transaction with Otic may not be consummated or may not deliver the anticipated benefits we expect.\nIn September 2016, we announced that our board of directors had initiated a review of strategic alternatives that could result in changes to our business strategy and future operations. As part of this process, which was conducted in parallel with our review of development options for galeterone and our drug discovery program, known as ARDA (Androgen Receptor Degradation Agents), our board determined to review alternatives with the goal of maximizing stockholder value, including potentially a sale of the company, a reverse merger, a business combination or a sale, license or other disposition of company assets. As part of this process, in December 2016, we entered into a share purchase agreement, or the Share Purchase Agreement, with Otic Pharma, Ltd., or Otic, and the shareholders of Otic named therein, pursuant to which, among other things, each Otic shareholder agreed to sell to us, and we agreed to purchase from each Otic shareholder, all of the ordinary and preferred shares of Otic in exchange for shares of our common stock. We refer to this transaction as the Otic Transaction. As a result of the Otic Transaction, Otic will become our wholly owned subsidiary and the Otic shareholders are expected to own approximately 60% of our common stock (62% if all of Otic\u2019s outstanding options and warrants are exercised prior to closing). We are devoting substantially all of our time and resources to consummating this transaction, however, there can be no assurance that such activities will result in the consummation of this transaction or that such transaction will deliver the anticipated benefits or enhance stockholder value.\nDuring the pendency of the Otic Transaction, we may not be able to enter into a business combination with another party under certain circumstances because of restrictions in the Share Purchase Agreement, which could adversely affect our business.\nCovenants in the Share Purchase Agreement impede our ability to make acquisitions or complete other transactions that are not in the ordinary course of business pending completion of the Otic Transaction. As a result, if the Otic Transaction is not completed, we may be at a disadvantage to our competitors during that period.\nCertain provisions of the Share Purchase Agreement may discourage third parties from submitting alternative acquisition proposals, including proposals that may be superior to the arrangements contemplated by the Share Purchase Agreement.\nThe terms of the Share Purchase Agreement prohibit each of us and Otic from soliciting alternative takeover proposals or cooperating with persons making unsolicited takeover proposals, except in limited circumstances when such party\u2019s board of directors determines in good faith that an unsolicited alternative takeover proposal is or is reasonably likely to lead to a superior takeover proposal and is reasonably capable of being consummated. In addition, if the Share Purchase Agreement is terminated by us or Otic under certain circumstances, including because of a decision of our board of directors to recommend a superior proposal, we would be required to pay a termination fee of $1.0 million to Otic. This termination fee may discourage third parties from submitting alternative takeover proposals to us or our stockholders, and may cause our board of directors to be less inclined to recommend an alternative proposal.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Otic Transaction, whether or not consummated, may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our business prospects.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Otic Transaction, whether or not consummated, may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our business prospects. In the event that the Otic Transaction is not completed, the announcement of the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our business prospects.\nFailure to consummate the Otic Transaction may result in us paying a termination fee to Otic and could harm our common stock price and our future business and operations.\nThe Otic Transaction will not be consummated if the conditions precedent to the consummation of the transaction are not satisfied or waived, or if the Share Purchase Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. If the Otic Transaction is not consummated, we are subject to the following risks:\n\u2022\nif the Share Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we will be required to pay Otic a termination fee of $1.0 million; and\n\u2022\nthe price of our common stock may decline and remain volatile.\nIf the Otic Transaction does not close for any reason, our board of directors may elect to, among other things, attempt to complete another strategic transaction, attempt to sell or otherwise dispose of our various assets, dissolve or liquidate our assets or seek to continue to operate our business. If we seek another strategic transaction or attempt to sell or otherwise dispose of our various assets, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so, that the terms would be equal to or superior to the terms of the Otic Transaction or as to the timing of such transaction. If we decide to dissolve and liquidate our assets, we would be required to pay all of our debts and contractual obligations, and to set aside certain reserves for potential future claims, and there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of available cash left to distribute to stockholders after paying our debts and other obligations and setting aside funds for reserves.\nIf we were to seek to continue our business, we would need to complete our assessment of our galeterone and ARDA programs to determine whether and how to continue one or both of these development programs or acquire one or more other product candidates. We would also need to raise funds to support continued operations and re-assess our workforce requirements in consideration of our reduced workforce.\nIf we do not successfully consummate the transaction with Otic, our board of directors may dissolve or liquidate our assets to pursue a dissolution and liquidation. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such transaction or liquidation.\nIf the Otic Transaction does not close for any reason, our board of directors may elect to, among other things, dissolve or liquidate our assets. If we decide to dissolve and liquidate our assets, we would be required to pay all of our debts and contractual obligations, and to set aside certain reserves for potential future claims, and there can be no assurances as to the amount or timing of available cash left to distribute to stockholders after paying our debts and other obligations and setting aside funds for reserves.\nIn the event of a dissolution and liquidation, the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such decision and, ultimately, such liquidation, since the amount of cash available for distribution continues to decrease as we fund our operations in preparation for the consummation of the Otic Transaction. Further, the Share Purchase Agreement contains certain termination rights for each party, and provides that, upon termination under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Otic a termination fee of $1.0 million, which would further decrease our available cash resources. If our board of directors were to approve and recommend, and our stockholders were to approve, a dissolution and liquidation, we would be required under Delaware corporate law to pay our outstanding obligations, as well as to\nmake reasonable provision for contingent and unknown obligations, prior to making any distributions in liquidation to our stockholders. Our commitments and contingent liabilities may include (i) regulatory and clinical obligations remaining under our clinical trials; (ii) obligations under our employment and separation agreements with certain employees that provide for severance and other payments following a termination of employment occurring for various reasons, including a change in control of us; and (iii) potential litigation against us, and other various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. As a result of this requirement, a portion of our assets may need to be reserved pending the resolution of such obligations. In addition, we may be subject to litigation or other claims related to a dissolution and liquidation of us. If a dissolution and liquidation were pursued, our board of directors, in consultation with our advisors, would need to evaluate these matters and make a determination about a reasonable amount to reserve. Accordingly, holders of our common stock could lose all or a significant portion of their investment in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to continue to incur losses and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was $38.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, $45.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $23.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $169.4 million. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through our initial public offering of our common stock, and prior to our initial public offering, through private placements of our redeemable convertible preferred stock and convertible promissory notes. We have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development, including clinical trials. We have not completed development of any product candidate and it may be several years, if ever, before we have a product candidate ready for commercialization.\nWe have devoted a significant portion of our financial resources to the development of galeterone. However, in July 2016, we announced our plan to discontinue the ARMOR3-SV clinical trial, our pivotal Phase 3 study comparing galeterone to Xtandi in treatment-na\u00efve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC, patients whose prostate tumors express the AR-V7 splice variant, following the recommendation of the trial\u2019s independent Data Monitoring Committee, or DMC, and ceased enrollment in this trial. In addition, in August 2016, we determined to discontinue enrollment in our ongoing Phase 2 ARMOR2 expansion clinical trial of galeterone in mCRPC patients with acquired resistance to Xtandi and not to proceed with our planned study of galeterone in mCRPC patients who rapidly progress on either enzalutamide or Zytiga. We conducted a review of unblinded data from the ARMOR3-SV clinical trial to evaluate potential paths forward for galeterone and our ARDA program. Based on data reviewed to date, there is a substantial likelihood that we will not pursue the development of galeterone in AR-V7 positive mCRPC patients in the future, however, we may still determine to proceed with the clinical development of galeterone and our ARDA program, terminate the galeterone clinical development program and focus on our ARDA program or proceed in other strategic directions. Our determination as to our next steps will necessarily impact the amount of expenses we incur and the size of our operating losses for the foreseeable future.\nIn September 2016, we announced that our board of directors had initiated a review of strategic alternatives that could result in changes to our business strategy and future operations. As part of this process, which was conducted in parallel with our review of development options for galeterone and our ARDA program, our board of directors determined to review alternatives with the goal of maximizing stockholder value. Potential strategic alternatives that we explored and evaluated during this review process included, among others, a sale of the company, a reverse merger, a business combination or a sale, license or other disposition of corporate assets of the company. This review process culminated in us entering into the Share Purchase Agreement with Otic and the Otic shareholders. If the Otic Transaction is not consummated, we will need to continue our review of strategic alternatives including evaluating potential paths forward for galeterone and our ARDA program. If the\nOtic Transaction is consummated or if we determine to pursue an alternate strategy, our future business, prospects, financial positon and operating results could be significantly different than those in historical periods or projected by our management. Because of the significant uncertainty regarding our future plans, we are not able to accurately predict the impact of a potential change on our business strategy and future funding requirements.\nIf we determine to further develop galeterone, proceed with our ARDA program, or both, we anticipate that we will continue to incur significant expenses if and as we:\n\u2022\nconduct clinical trials with galeterone or any other product candidates in the future;\n\u2022\nidentify compounds that are designed to disrupt androgen receptor signaling through enhanced androgen receptor degradation under our ARDA program;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements with third parties to manufacture galeterone or other product candidates;\n\u2022\nestablish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to support the commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nmaintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022\ncontinue our other research and development efforts;\n\u2022\nacquire or in-license additional compounds or technologies; and\n\u2022\noperate as a public company.\nWe have never generated any revenue from product sales and may never be profitable. To become and remain profitable, we must develop and eventually commercialize a product or products with significant market potential and market acceptance. This development and commercialization will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including successfully completing preclinical testing and clinical trials of galeterone and any of our future product candidates, obtaining marketing and regulatory approval for these product candidates, partnering with third parties to manufacture our product candidates in commercial quantities, marketing and selling those products for which we may obtain regulatory approval, and obtaining reimbursement from third-party payors. We may never succeed in these activities and may never generate revenues that are significant or large enough to achieve profitability.\nEven if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, such that a period-to-period comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance. In any particular quarter or quarters, our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause our share price to decline. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause our stockholders to lose all or part of their investment.\nIf we do not successfully consummate the Otic Transaction, our board of directors may attempt to continue our business. We will need substantial additional funding to continue our development of, and to commercialize, galeterone or any future product candidate, which funding may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we may be forced to delay, reduce, terminate or eliminate product development programs.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash and investments of $27.4 million. In light of the discontinuation of the ARMOR3-SV trial and the reduction in workforce that occurred in the third quarter of 2016 and assuming no new clinical efforts for galeterone or any other product candidate, if we do not successfully consummate the Otic Transaction, we expect our cash and investments as of December 31, 2016 to be sufficient to fund operations\nthrough at least the first quarter of 2018. We have devoted a significant portion of our cash resources to the development of galeterone and ARMOR3-SV trial. However, in July 2016, we announced our plan to discontinue the ARMOR3-SV clinical trial. While we have entered into the Share Purchase Agreement, our operating plan may change or the consummation of the Otic Transaction may be delayed or may not occur at all. If the Otic Transaction is not consummated and we determine to further develop galeterone, proceed with our ARDA program or both, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding. If the Otic Transaction is not consummated, we will need to continue our review of strategic alternatives including evaluating potential paths forward for galeterone and our ARDA program. If the Otic Transaction is consummated or if we determine to pursue an alternate strategy, our future business, prospects, financial positon and operating results could be significantly different than those in historical periods or projected by our management. If we determine to further develop galeterone, proceed with our ARDA program, or both, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding. Because of the significant uncertainty regarding our future plans, we are not able to accurately predict the impact of a potential change on our business strategy and future funding requirements. If our cash and investments are not sufficient to fund our approved strategy and we are unable to raise capital when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce, terminate or eliminate our product development programs and our commercialization efforts.\nIf the Otic Transaction is not consummated, and we decide to continue our historical business operations, our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nour determination regarding potential paths forward for galeterone and our ARDA program;\n\u2022\nour analysis of the available unblinded data from ARMOR3-SV clinical trial;\n\u2022\nthe scope, progress and results of any additional clinical trials of galeterone that we decide to conduct;\n\u2022\nthe timing and outcome of regulatory review of galeterone and of any other future product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe cost of commercialization activities, including product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for galeterone and our future product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nthe development of future product candidates, including our plans to seek to acquire or in-license additional compounds or technologies;\n\u2022\nrevenue, if any, received from commercial sales of galeterone and any future product candidates, should any of our product candidates be approved by the FDA or a similar regulatory authority outside the United States;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish collaborations on favorable terms, if at all, particularly arrangements to develop, market and distribute galeterone and any future product candidates outside the United States; and\n\u2022\nthe cost of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims.\nConducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain regulatory approval and achieve product sales. In addition, galeterone and any future product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for several years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to curtail our operations.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations, require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates or divert our management\u2019s attention from our operating activities.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, and collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders\u2019 ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that require liens to be placed on our property and include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or current or future product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Additional fundraising efforts may also divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may compromise our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nIf the Otic Transaction is not consummated, we will need to continue our review of strategic alternatives for the company, including evaluating potential paths forward for galeterone and our ARDA program that could significantly impact our future operations and financial position.\nIn July 2016, we announced our plan to discontinue the ARMOR3-SV clinical trial. In September 2016, we announced that our board of directors had initiated a review of strategic alternatives that could result in changes to our business strategy and future operations. As part of this process, which was conducted in parallel with our review of development options for galeterone and our ARDA drug program, our board of directors determined to review alternatives with the goal of maximizing stockholder value. Potential strategic alternatives that we explored and evaluated during this review process included, among others, a sale of the company, a reverse merger, a business combination or a sale, license or other disposition of corporate assets of the company. We entered into the Share Purchase Agreement with Otic and the Otic shareholders as a result of this process. If the Otic Transaction is not consummated, our board of directors will need to resume this review of strategic alternatives. If we determine to pursue an alternate strategy or engage in a strategic transaction, our future business, prospects, financial positon and operating results could be significantly different than those in historical periods or projected by our management. Pending any decision to further change strategic direction, we have limited our research and development activities to manage our cash position. In such event, we cannot provide any commitment as to the timing of our determination or the strategy we may adopt. If we determine to change our business strategy or to seek to engage in a strategic transaction, our future business, prospects, financial position and operating results could be significantly different than those in historical periods or projected by our management. If we determine to further develop galeterone, proceed with our ARDA program, or both, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding. Because of the significant uncertainty regarding our future plans, we are not able to accurately predict the impact of a potential change in our business strategy and future funding requirements.\nRisks Related to the Development and Regulatory Approval of Galeterone and Our Future Product Candidates\nWe have depended heavily on the success of our lead product candidate, galeterone, which was in clinical development for the treatment of AR-V7 positive mCRPC patients. Any failure to successfully develop galeterone or any future product candidates, or significant delays in doing so, would compromise our ability to generate revenue and become profitable.\nWe currently have no products approved for sale and have only one product candidate, galeterone, in clinical development. We have invested substantially all of our efforts and financial resources in the development\nof galeterone. In July 2016, we announced our plan to discontinue the ARMOR3-SV clinical trial following the recommendation made by the DMC. Based on a review of all safety and efficacy data, the DMC determined that the ARMOR3-SV trial would likely not succeed in meeting its primary endpoint of demonstrating an improvement in radiographic progression-free survival, or rPFS, for galeterone versus Xtandi in AR-V7 positive mCRPC. We also closed enrollment of our ARMOR2 expansion trial in mCRPC patients with acquired resistance to Xtandi, and announced our intention not to proceed with our planned study in patients who rapidly progress on either Xtandi or Zytiga. If the Otic Transaction is consummated, we do not expect Otic to proceed with the development of galeterone or our ARDA program. If the Otic Transaction is not consummated, we expect to continue to evaluate potential paths forward for galeterone and our ARDA program. We conducted a review of unblinded data from the ARMOR3-SV clinical trial to evaluate potential paths forward for galeterone and our ARDA program. Based on data reviewed to date, there is a substantial likelihood that we will not pursue the development of galeterone in AR-V7 positive mCRPC patients in the future.\nIf we determine to proceed with the development of galeterone, our ability to generate product revenues, which we do not expect will occur for at least the next several years, if ever, will depend heavily on the successful development and commercialization of galeterone for mCRPC patients or for other indications or patient populations. In light of our discontinuance of ARMOR3-SV, there is a significant risk that we will be unable to successfully develop galeterone.\nThe success of galeterone or other future product candidates, under our ARDA program or otherwise, will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully completing clinical trials, including obtaining clinical results that are statistically significant as well as clinically meaningful in the context of the indications for which we may develop galeterone and our future product candidates;\n\u2022\nreceiving marketing approvals for our products from the FDA and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States;\n\u2022\nmaking arrangements with third-party manufacturers for, or establishing, commercial manufacturing capabilities;\n\u2022\nobtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for galeterone or other product candidates under our ARDA program, both in the United States and internationally;\n\u2022\nestablishing successful sales and marketing arrangements and launching commercial sales of our products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u2022\nobtaining commercial acceptance of our products, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u2022\nobtaining and maintaining adequate reimbursement;\n\u2022\neffectively competing with other therapies;\n\u2022\nprotecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio; and\n\u2022\nmaintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of our products following regulatory approval.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize galeterone and our future product candidates, which would materially harm our business.\nIf clinical trials of galeterone and our future product candidates, under our ARDA program or otherwise, fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States or are not otherwise successful, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of galeterone and our future product candidates.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of galeterone and our future product candidates, we must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval for their product candidates. For instance, in July 2016, we announced our plan to discontinue our ARMOR3-SV clinical trial, following the recommendation made by the DMC. Based on a review of all safety and efficacy data at the time, the DMC determined that our ARMOR3-SV trial would likely not succeed in meeting its primary endpoint of demonstrating an improvement in rPFS for galeterone versus Xtandi in AR-V7 positive mCRPC. We have also closed enrollment in our ARMOR2 expansion trial in mCRPC patients with acquired resistance to enzalutamide and announced our intention not to proceed with our planned study in patients who rapidly progress on either Xtandi or Zytiga. If the Otic Transaction is consummated, we do not expect Otic to proceed with the development of galeterone or our ARDA program. If the Otic Transaction is not consummated, we will continue to evaluate potential paths forward for galeterone and our ARDA program. Based on data reviewed to date, however, there is a substantial likelihood that we will not pursue the development of galeterone in AR-V7 positive mCRPC in the future. If we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials or other testing of galeterone or our future product candidates, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety or efficacy concerns, we may:\n\u2022\nbe delayed in obtaining marketing approval for galeterone or our future product candidates;\n\u2022\nnot obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u2022\nobtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u2022\nobtain approval with labeling that includes significant use restrictions or safety warnings, including boxed warnings;\n\u2022\nbe subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements;\n\u2022\nbe subject to restrictions on how the product is distributed or used; or\n\u2022\nhave the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nIf we experience any of a number of possible unforeseen events in connection with our preclinical studies or clinical trials, our ability to conduct further clinical trials of, obtain regulatory approval of or commercialize galeterone or our future product candidates, under our ARDA program or otherwise, could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, preclinical studies or clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to conduct further clinical trials, obtain regulatory approval or commercialization of galeterone or our future product candidates, under our ARDA program or otherwise. For instance, in July 2016, we announced our plan to discontinue our ARMOR3-SV clinical trial following the recommendation of the DMC. Unforeseen events that could delay or prevent our ability to conduct clinical trials, obtain regulatory approval or commercialize galeterone and our future product candidates include the following:\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022\nwe may have delays in reaching or fail to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites;\n\u2022\npreclinical studies and clinical trials of galeterone or our future product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional preclinical or clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u2022\nthe number of patients required for clinical trials of galeterone or our future product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, patient enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nour failure to conduct our clinical trials in accordance with the FDA\u2019s good clinical practices or applicable regulatory requirements in other countries;\n\u2022\nwe may decide, or regulators or institutional review boards may require us or our investigators to, suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements, a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or the occurrence of serious adverse events associated with galeterone or our future product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe cost of clinical trials of galeterone and our future product candidates may be greater than we anticipate; and\n\u2022\nthe supply or quality of galeterone or our future product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of such product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate.\nIn addition, the patients recruited for clinical trials of our product candidates may have characteristics that are different than we expect and different than the clinical trials were designed for, which could adversely impact the results of the clinical trials. For example, our patients could develop genetic mutations that are not responsive or are otherwise resistant to galeterone.\nOur product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or obtaining marketing approvals. We do not know whether any of our planned clinical trials will begin as planned, or whether our ongoing or planned clinical trials will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or completed at all. In addition to additional costs, significant clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our product candidates.\nGaleterone could ultimately prove to be ineffective or unsafe.\nGaleterone has been administered to several hundred prostate cancer patients and healthy volunteers in clinical trials. Despite this experience, we have yet to fully explore the safety and efficacy of galeterone. In our clinical trials prior to ARMOR3-SV, galeterone had been well tolerated and had showed clinically meaningful reductions in levels of prostate specific antigen, or PSA, a biochemical marker used to evaluate prostate cancer patients for signs of response to therapy. In July 2016, we announced our plan to discontinue our ARMOR3-SV trial, following the recommendation by the DMC. Based on a review of all available safety and efficacy data, the DMC determined that our ARMOR3-SV trial would likely not succeed in meeting its primary endpoint of demonstrating an improvement in rPFS for galeterone versus Xtandi in AR-V7 positive mCRPC. We are evaluating potential paths forward for galeterone and our ARDA program. We conducted a review of unblinded data from the ARMOR3-SV clinical trial to evaluate potential paths forward for galeterone and our ARDA program. Based on data reviewed to date, there is a substantial likelihood that we will not pursue the development of galeterone in AR-V7 positive mCRPC patients in the future.\nNo assessment of the efficacy, safety or side effects of a product candidate can be considered complete until all clinical trials needed to support a submission for marketing approval are complete, and success in early-stage clinical trials does not mean that subsequent trials will confirm the earlier findings, or that experience with use of\na product in large-scale commercial distribution will not identify additional safety or efficacy issues. If we find from our analysis of the available data from ARMOR3-SV or otherwise that galeterone is not safe, or if its efficacy cannot be consistently demonstrated, we may not be able to commercialize, or may be required to cease distribution of, the product. Galeterone may also prove to be substantially identical or inferior to drugs already available, in which case the market for galeterone would be reduced or eliminated.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in our clinical trials, or patients discontinue their participation in our clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to complete any clinical trials we may conduct in the future if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. In particular, if the Otic Transaction is not consummated and we determine to proceed with the development of galeterone after analyzing the available unblinded data from ARMOR3-SV, our recent set back with ARMOR3-SV will likely negatively impact our ability to enroll patients in ongoing and future trials of galeterone.\nOur competitors may have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that could be competitive with galeterone and our future product candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors\u2019 product candidates.\nWe may not be able to identify, recruit and enroll a sufficient number of patients, or those with required or desired characteristics to achieve diversity in a trial, to complete our clinical trials in a timely manner. Patient enrollment is affected by other factors including:\n\u2022\nseverity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022\ndesign of the trial protocol;\n\u2022\neligibility criteria for the study in question;\n\u2022\nperceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u2022\ntrials of other products for similar indications;\n\u2022\nefforts to facilitate timely patient enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u2022\npatient referral practices of physicians;\n\u2022\nalternative products for similar indications;\n\u2022\nthe ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and\n\u2022\nproximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nIf serious adverse or unforeseen side effects are identified during the development of galeterone or our future product candidates, we may need to abandon or limit our development of some or all of our product candidates.\nIf galeterone or our future product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their development or limit development to certain indications or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Adverse or unexpected side effects or characteristics of galeterone, whether discovered by us or independently publicized by third parties during clinical trials, could cause an institutional review board or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials of galeterone or our future product candidates, require us to conduct additional clinical trials or other tests or studies, and could result in a more restrictive label, or the delay or denial of marketing approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nAs of January 31, 2017, nine of the 126 patients enrolled in ARMOR2 had experienced a serious adverse event that was assessed by the investigator as related or possibly related to the administration of galeterone. No single treatment-related serious adverse event occurred in more than one patient and no adverse events had resulted in interruptions or delays of the clinical trial. In addition, in making its recommendation with respect to ARMOR3-SV, the DMC did not cite any safety concerns with galeterone in the trial.\nIf we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize galeterone, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval for galeterone for mCRPC patients or for other indications and patient populations, will prevent us from commercializing galeterone for those indications. Although our management team has experience filing and supporting applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals, we have yet to file for or obtain regulatory approval to market galeterone or any other product candidate in any jurisdiction. Securing FDA approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the FDA for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy. Securing FDA approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the FDA. Our product candidates may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining regulatory approval or prevent or limit commercial use.\nThe process of obtaining regulatory approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is expensive, may take many years if additional clinical trials are required, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate involved. Changes in regulatory approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of galeterone. Any regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render galeterone commercially unviable.\nIf we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of galeterone, the commercial prospects for galeterone may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired.\nEven if we complete the necessary clinical trials, we cannot predict when or if we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize galeterone or our future product candidates or the approval may be for a more narrow indication than we expect.\nEven if galeterone or any of our future product candidates demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials, regulatory agencies may not complete their review processes in a timely manner or grant regulatory approval at all. Additional delays may result if a regulatory authority recommends non-approval or restrictions on approval. In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action, or changes in regulatory agency policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and the review process. Regulatory agencies also may approve a product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than requested or may grant approval subject to the performance of post-marketing studies. In addition, regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of galeterone or our future product candidates.\nWe have obtained fast track designation from the FDA for galeterone for the treatment of mCRPC. However, fast track designation may not actually lead to a faster development, regulatory review or approval process.\nIf a product is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the product candidate demonstrates the potential to address unmet needs for this condition, the treatment sponsor may apply for FDA\nfast track designation. If the fast track designation is obtained, the FDA may initiate review of sections of an NDA, before the application is complete. This \u201crolling review\u201d is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for submission of the individual sections of the application. In June 2012, the FDA notified us that we had obtained fast track designation for galeterone for the treatment of mCRPC. Fast track designation does not ensure that we will experience a faster development, regulatory review or approval process compared to conventional FDA procedures or that we will ultimately obtain regulatory approval of galeterone. Additionally, the FDA may withdraw fast track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program.\nIn the event we receive FDA approval for galeterone or any future product candidates, we will not be able to expand the indications for which such product is approved unless we receive FDA approval for each additional indication. Failure to expand these indications will limit the size of the commercial market for the product.\nWe focused our development of galeterone on the treatment of AR-V7 positive mCRPC patients and planned to seek marketing and regulatory approvals for galeterone for this patient population. Even if the Otic Transaction is not consummated, based on our review of unblinded data from the ARMOR3-SV clinical trial reviewed to date, there is a substantial likelihood that we will not pursue the development of galeterone in AR-V7 positive mCRPC patients in the future. We are also evaluating our plan to develop galeterone for the treatment of other indications and patient populations in prostate cancer in light of the discontinuation of the ARMOR3-SV study. In order to market and sell galeterone in the United States for any additional indications or any future products or additional indications, we will need to conduct additional clinical trials and obtain FDA approval for each proposed indication. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining FDA approval for additional indications for the use of galeterone. If we are unsuccessful in expanding the approved indications for the use of galeterone or any future products, the size of the commercial market for the product will be limited.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval in international jurisdictions would prevent galeterone or our future product candidates from being marketed abroad.\nIn order to market and sell our products in jurisdictions outside the United States, we or third parties must obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval process varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain foreign approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the product be separately approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We intend to enter into arrangements with third parties under which they would market our products outside the United States. We or these third parties may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nWe have no history of commercializing pharmaceutical products, which may make it difficult to evaluate the prospects for our future viability.\nWe have never commercialized a product candidate. Our operations to date have been limited to financing and staffing our company, developing our product candidates and conducting our preclinical studies and clinical trials. We have not completed a pivotal clinical trial, obtained marketing approvals or conducted sales and\nmarketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Consequently, predictions about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a history of successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products.\nWe may also encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors. In the future, we will need to transition from a company with a preclinical and clinical development focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities. We may not be successful in such a transition.\nEven if galeterone or any future product candidate receives regulatory approval, it may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nEven if galeterone or any future product candidate receives marketing approval, it may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community. If such product does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of galeterone or any of our future product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nefficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe ability to offer galeterone and our future product candidates for sale at competitive prices;\n\u2022\nconvenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nour understanding of the market and development of an effective commercial strategy;\n\u2022\nthe strength of sales, marketing, medical affairs and distribution support;\n\u2022\nthe approval of other products for the same indications;\n\u2022\ncombinations of existing or newly approved products that alter the standard of care;\n\u2022\navailability and amount of reimbursement from government payors, managed care plans and other third-party payors;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity about the product or favorable publicity about competitive products;\n\u2022\nclinical indications for which the product is approved; and\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects.\nEven if a potential product candidate displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile in preclinical studies and clinical trials, market acceptance of the product will not be known until after it is launched. Our efforts to educate the medical community, patients and third-party payors on the benefits of galeterone or our other future product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nIf galeterone or any of our future product candidates receives marketing approval and we, or others, later discover that the product is less effective than previously believed or causes undesirable side effects that were not previously identified, our ability to market the product could be compromised.\nClinical trials are conducted in carefully defined subsets of patients who have agreed to enter into clinical trials. Consequently, it is possible that our clinical trials may indicate an apparent positive effect of a product candidate that is greater than the actual positive effect in a broader patient population or alternatively fail to identify undesirable side effects. If, following approval of a product candidate, we, or others, discover that the product is less effective than previously believed or causes undesirable side effects that were not previously identified, any of the following adverse events could occur:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or seize the product;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to recall the product or change the way the product is administered;\n\u2022\nadditional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of, or the manufacturing processes for, the particular product;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a \u201cblack box\u201d warning or a contraindication;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to create a Medication Guide outlining the risks of the previously unidentified side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u2022\nadditional restrictions may be imposed on the distribution or use of the product via a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy;\n\u2022\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\u2022\nthe product may become less competitive; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our operations and business and could adversely impact our stock price.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates, we may not be successful in commercializing galeterone or any of our future product candidates if they are approved.\nWe do not have a sales or marketing infrastructure and have limited experience in the sale, marketing or distribution of pharmaceutical products. To achieve commercial success for any approved product, we must either outsource these functions to third parties or develop an internal sales and marketing organization. Reliance on third parties to market our products, if approved, is risky as these parties may not perform satisfactorily or at all.\nThere are risks involved with both entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services and establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities, neither of which we have pursued previously. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time-consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retrain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products on our own include:\n\u2022\nour inability to recruit and retain an adequate number of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022\nthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future products;\n\u2022\nthe lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nIf we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing and distribution services, our product revenues or the profitability of these products are likely to be lower than if we were to market and sell any products that we develop ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with\nthird parties to sell and market galeterone or our future product candidates or doing so on terms that are favorable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing galeterone or our future product candidates.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. Research and discoveries by others may result in breakthroughs which may render our products obsolete even before they generate any revenue. We face competition with respect to our lead product candidate, and will face competition with respect to any products that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. There are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of the disease indications for which we were developing galeterone. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.\nSome of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our approach, and others are based on entirely different approaches. Many marketed therapies for the indications that we are currently pursuing, or indications that we may in the future seek to address, are widely accepted by physicians, patients and payors, which may make it difficult for us to replace them with any products that we successfully develop and are permitted to market.\nIf galeterone is approved for the treatment of mCRPC, it may compete with other commonly-used oral hormonal treatments being marketed, such as Zytiga and Xtandi, chemotherapeutic agents, or with drug candidates currently in development. Galeterone could compete in the future with products, marketed by several of the world\u2019s largest and most experienced pharmaceutical companies. These companies have substantially more financial resources than we do and greater flexibility to engage in aggressive price competition to gain revenues and market share. Approved second-generation hormonal treatments in the United States for mCRPC include Zytiga, marketed by Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Xtandi, marketed by Astellas Pharma US, Inc. and Medivation, Inc. Approved non-hormonal agents for mCRPC include Taxotere\u00ae (docetaxel) and Jevtana\u00ae (cabazitaxel), marketed by sanofi-aventis U.S. LLC; Provenge\u00ae (sipuleucel-T), marketed by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.; and Xofigo\u00ae (radium-223), marketed by Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Inc. It is uncertain whether we could compete with such products, and our failure to compete or decision to reduce the price of galeterone or other future products we may develop in order to compete could severely impact our business. In addition, there are numerous prostate cancer products in clinical development by many public and private biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies targeting numerous different cancer types.\nOur competitors may develop products that are more effective, safer, more convenient or less costly than any that we are developing or that would render galeterone or any future product candidates obsolete or non-competitive. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours.\nMany of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, medical and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\nEven if we are able to commercialize galeterone or any other future product candidates, the products may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. In the United States, recently passed legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain regulatory approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in galeterone or our future product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain regulatory approval.\nOur ability to commercialize any products successfully will also depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, the level of reimbursement. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we receive marketing approval. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we receive marketing approval.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs, and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of galeterone and our future product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any products that we may develop. Galeterone has not been widely used over an extended period of time, and therefore our safety data are limited.\nIf we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that galeterone or future product candidates or products we may develop caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\nsignificant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nWe currently hold $10 million in product liability insurance coverage, which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We will need to increase our insurance coverage when we begin commercializing galeterone and our future product candidates, if ever. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials.\nWe do not independently conduct clinical trials of our product candidates. We rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to perform this function. Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities. We remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, regulatory approvals for galeterone or other product candidates we may develop in the future and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nWe may enter into collaborations with third parties for the development and commercialization of galeterone and future product candidates we may develop. If those collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these product candidates.\nWe may enter into collaborations with third parties for the development and commercialization of galeterone and future product candidates we may develop. Collaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner, or at all. We will likely have limited control under any additional arrangements we may enter into with third parties over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators\u2019 abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\nCollaborations involving our product candidates would pose the following risks to us:\n\u2022\ncollaborators may have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborator\u2019s strategic focus or available funding, or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products;\n\u2022\nare more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u2022\ncollaborators with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may have the right to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates without our consent and could conduct trials with flawed designs that result in data that adversely affect our clinical trials, our ability to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates or market acceptance of our product candidates;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u2022\ndisputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our products or product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources; and\n\u2022\ncollaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates.\nIn addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators. If a present or future collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program could be delayed, diminished or terminated.\nIf we are not able to establish collaborations, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nWe will face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators if we determine to do so. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend upon, among other things, our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Such factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally. The collaborator may also consider alternative\nproduct candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available for collaboration and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for galeterone. We may also be restricted under existing license agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms with potential collaborators. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. We may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIf we are not able to enter into collaborations for galeterone, we may have to curtail the development of galeterone, reduce or delay our development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay our potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop galeterone or other future candidates or bring these product candidates to market and generate product revenue.\nRisks Related to the Manufacturing of Galeterone and Our Future Product Candidates\nWe contract with third parties for the manufacture of galeterone for clinical trials and expect to continue to do so in connection with the commercialization of galeterone and for clinical trials and commercialization of any other product candidates that we develop. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nWe do not currently have nor do we plan to build the internal infrastructure or capability to manufacture galeterone. We currently rely on and expect to continue to rely on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture clinical supplies of galeterone and any other product candidates we may develop. We expect to continue to rely upon third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture commercial quantities of galeterone and any other product candidates that we commercialize following approval for marketing by applicable regulatory authorities. Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks, including:\n\u2022\nmanufacturing delays if our third-party manufacturers give greater priority to the supply of other products over our product candidates or otherwise do not satisfactorily perform according to the terms of the agreement between us;\n\u2022\nthe possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us;\n\u2022\nthe possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party;\n\u2022\nthe failure of the third-party manufacturer to comply with applicable regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022\nthe possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how.\nWe currently rely on a small number of third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials, drug substance and finished product for our clinical trials. We do not have long-term agreements with any of these third parties. If any of our existing manufacturers should become unavailable to us for any reason, we may incur some delay in our clinical trials as we identify or qualify replacements.\nWe currently rely on a single third-party contract manufacturer, with which we do not have a long-term agreement, to supply us with the spray dried dispersion formulation of galeterone. If this third-party manufacturer fails to fulfill orders or should become unavailable to us for any reason, we likely would incur some delay in our clinical trials for galeterone and added costs and delays in identifying or qualifying such replacements. In addition, we may be unable to establish any agreements with such replacement manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms or at all. Even if we could transfer manufacturing to a different third party, the shift would likely be expensive and time-consuming.\nIf galeterone or any other product candidate that we may develop in the future is approved by any regulatory agency, we intend to enter into agreements with third-party contract manufacturers for the commercial production of those products. This process is difficult and time-consuming and we may face competition for access to manufacturing facilities as there are a limited number of contract manufacturers operating under current good manufacturing processes, or cGMPs that are capable of manufacturing our product candidates. As a result, we may be unable to reach agreement with third-party manufacturers on satisfactory terms or at all, which could delay our commercialization.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of galeterone and any other product candidate that we develop may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any products that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nIf our third-party manufacturers\u2019 facilities are damaged or destroyed, or production at one of these facilities is otherwise interrupted, our business and prospects would be negatively affected.\nIf any manufacturing facilities owned by third parties who manufacture galeterone or any of our future product candidates are damaged or destroyed, we likely would not be able to quickly or inexpensively replace our manufacturing capacity and possibly would not be able to replace it at all. Any new facility needed to replace these facilities would need to comply with the necessary regulatory requirements and need to be tailored to our specialized manufacturing requirements. We would need FDA approval before selling any products manufactured at a new facility. Such an event could delay our clinical trials or, if any of our product candidates are approved by the FDA, reduce or eliminate our product sales.\nWhile we maintain insurance coverage to cover damage to our property and equipment and to cover business interruption and research and development restoration expenses, if we have underestimated our insurance needs with respect to an interruption in our clinical manufacturing of our product candidates, we may not be able to adequately cover our losses.\nWe rely on our third-party manufacturers for compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. This may increase the risk of sanctions being imposed on us or on a manufacturer of our products or product candidates, which could result in our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of these products or product candidates.\nOur manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMPs, regulations or other regulatory requirements or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including:\n\u2022\nfines;\n\u2022\ninjunctions;\n\u2022\ncivil penalties;\n\u2022\nfailure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our product candidates;\n\u2022\ndelays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals;\n\u2022\nsuspension of manufacturing operations;\n\u2022\nlicense revocation;\n\u2022\nseizures or recalls of products or product candidates;\n\u2022\noperating restrictions; and\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecutions.\nAny of these sanctions could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products and product candidates.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under our intellectual property licenses with third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to a master license agreement with the University of Maryland, Baltimore, or UMB, under which we license certain patents and patent applications to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell and import certain anti-androgen compounds, including galeterone, and an exclusive, worldwide license with Johns Hopkins under which we license patents, patent applications and know-how covering certain assays to identify androgen receptor variants for use as a companion diagnostic with galeterone. We may enter into additional license agreements in the future. Our license agreements with UMB and Johns Hopkins impose, and we expect that future license agreements will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these licenses, our licensors may have the right to terminate these license agreements, in which event we might not be able to market any product that is covered by these agreements, or our licensors may convert the license to a non-exclusive license, which could materially adversely affect the value of the product candidate being developed under the license agreement. Termination of these license agreements or reduction or elimination of our licensed rights may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses with less favorable terms.\nRestrictions on our patent rights relating to our drug candidates may limit our ability to prevent third parties from competing against us.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for product candidates, preserve our trade secrets, prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. As of January 31, 2017, we owned and/or licensed 18 issued U.S. patents, seven pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, three pending international patent applications, 88 granted foreign patents and 67 pending foreign applications in our galeterone patent portfolio. Our owned and/or licensed patents and patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire on various dates from 2017 through 2036, without taking into account any possible patent term extensions. Upon the expiration of these patents, we will lose the right to exclude others from practicing the inventions claimed by such patents. As a result, the expiration of these patents could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time until they are published, and publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature typically lags actual discoveries by several months or more. As a result, we cannot be certain that we and the inventors of the intellectual property for which we have submitted patent applications or in-license issued patents and applications, were the first to conceive of the inventions covered by such patents and pending patent applications or that we and those inventors were the first to file patent applications covering such inventions. Also, the patent protection of our numerous issued and pending patent applications may lapse before we manage to obtain commercial value from them, which might result in increased competition and materially affect our position in the market.\nWe have no patent protection specifically covering the chemical structure of galeterone. As a result, a third party that obtains regulatory approval of a product with the same active ingredient as galeterone may be able to market such product so long as the third party does not infringe any other patents owned or licensed by us with respect to galeterone. A U.S. patent we have exclusively licensed from UMB covering galeterone-related compounds and their use expires in 2017. For this reason, we have filed for or licensed additional patents and patent applications relating to galeterone covering methods of use, pharmaceutical compositions, combination treatments, prodrugs, metabolites and analogs of galeterone and their use.\nWe also have an exclusive license from Johns Hopkins for patents and patent applications in the United States, Europe, and Canada covering methods of determining whether a subject may respond to androgen therapy, and methods of determining a subject\u2019s risk of recurrence of hormone-refractory or hormone-na\u00efve prostate cancer that are expected to expire in 2029. These patents applications may provide protection for an\nAR-V7 specific assay or a companion diagnostic test using this assay that we may develop and commercialize. However, these patent applications do not provide any protection for galeterone or for galeterone\u2019s pharmaceutical formulations or uses.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if our licensors are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for the technology or products that we license from them, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in large part on our and our licensors\u2019 ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. We and our licensors have sought to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and products that are important to our business. This process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development efforts before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, prior to April 10, 2012, we did not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology or products that we license from UMB, and we were and still are reliant on UMB. Therefore, we cannot be certain that these patents and applications were prosecuted in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If we or our licensors fail to maintain such patents, or lose rights to those patents, the rights we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our and our licensors\u2019 patent rights are highly uncertain. Our and our licensors\u2019 pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued that protect our technology or products or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nThird parties could practice our inventions in territories where we do not have patent protection. Furthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. A U.S. patent may be infringed by anyone who, without authorization, practices a patented process in the United States or imports a product made by a process covered by the U.S. patent. In foreign countries, however, importation of a product made by a process patented in that country may not constitute an infringing activity, which would limit our ability to enforce process patents against importers in that country. Furthermore, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights. If competitors are able to use our technologies, our ability to compete effectively could be harmed.\nAssuming the other requirements for patentability are met, in the United States, the first to invent the claimed invention is entitled to the patent, while outside the United States, the first to file a patent application is generally entitled to the patent. Under the America Invents Act, or AIA, enacted in September 2011, the United States moved to a first inventor to file system in March 2013. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office recently finalized the rules relating to these changes and courts have yet to address the new provisions. These changes could increase the costs and uncertainties surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of patent rights. Furthermore, we may become involved in interference proceedings, opposition proceedings, or other post-grant proceedings, such as reexamination or inter partes review proceedings, challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our\ntechnology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights.\nEven if our owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges, including through opposition or other post-grant proceedings, may result in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to or stop or prevent us from stopping others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u2022\nothers may be able to make or use compounds that are similar to galeterone but that are not covered by the claims of our patents;\n\u2022\nthe galeterone compound may become generic, and no patent protection will be available without regard to formulation or method of use;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors, as the case may be, may not be able to detect infringement against our owned or in-licensed patents, which may be especially difficult for manufacturing processes or formulations;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors, as the case may be, might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by our owned or in-licensed issued patents or pending patent applications;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors, as the case may be, might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions or the first to conceive or reduce to practice these inventions;\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u2022\nthis may be especially likely for manufacturing processes or formulations;\n\u2022\nit is possible that our pending patent applications will not result in issued patents;\n\u2022\nit is possible that our owned or in-licensed issued patents or pending patent applications are not Orange Book eligible;\n\u2022\nit is possible that there are dominating patents to galeterone of which we are not aware;\n\u2022\nit is possible that there are prior public disclosures that could invalidate our or our licensors\u2019 inventions, as the case may be, or parts of our or their inventions of which we or they are not aware;\n\u2022\nit is possible that others may circumvent our owned or in-licensed patents;\n\u2022\nit is possible that there are unpublished applications or patent applications maintained in secrecy that may later issue with claims covering our products or technology similar to ours;\n\u2022\nit is possible that the U.S. government may exercise any of its statutory rights to our owned or in-licensed patents or patent applications that was developed with government funding;\n\u2022\nthe laws of foreign countries may not protect our or our licensors\u2019, as the case may be, proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States;\n\u2022\nthe claims of our owned or in-licensed issued patents or patent applications, if and when issued, may not cover our product candidates;\n\u2022\nour owned or in-licensed issued patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be narrowed in scope, be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges by third parties; or\n\u2022\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies for which we can obtain patent protection.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents. To counter such infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims against third parties, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, during an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that the patent rights we are asserting are invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, our licensors may have rights to file and prosecute such claims, and we are reliant on them.\nClaims that galeterone or any future product candidate or the manufacture, use or sale of galeterone or any future product candidate infringe the patent rights of third parties could result in costly litigation or could require substantial time and money to resolve, even if litigation is avoided.\nWe cannot guarantee that the manufacture, use or sale of galeterone or any future product candidate, does not and will not infringe third-party patents. Third parties might allege that we are infringing their patent rights or that we have misappropriated their trade secrets. Such third parties might resort to litigation against us. The basis of such litigation could be existing patents or patents that issue in the future.\nIt is also possible that we failed to identify relevant third-party patents or applications. For example, certain U.S. patent applications that will not be filed outside the United States may remain confidential until patents issue. Furthermore, patent applications in the United States and elsewhere are published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing, which is referred to as the priority date. Therefore, patent applications covering galeterone, its manufacture, use or sale, could have been filed by others without our knowledge. Additionally, pending patent applications that have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover galeterone or its use.\nWe are aware of two issued U.S. patents having broad claims relating to a composition of matter or its use in regulating cellular differentiation or proliferation. We are also aware of certain third-party pending U.S. patent applications that have broad generic disclosures and disclosure of certain compounds possessing structural similarities to galeterone. Although we believe that it is unlikely that such applications will lead to issued claims that would cover galeterone and its use and still be valid, patent prosecution is inherently unpredictable and an application could be allowed. Based on our analyses, we do not believe our proposed products or activities would be found to infringe any valid claims of these patents if any of the above third-party patents or patent applications, if issued, were asserted against us. If we were to challenge the validity of an issued U.S. patent in court, however, we would need to overcome a statutory presumption of validity that attaches to every U.S. patent. This means that, in order to prevail, we would have to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent\u2019s claims. There is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement or validity.\nIn order to avoid or settle potential claims with respect to any patent rights of third parties, we may choose or be required to seek a license from a third party and be required to pay license fees or royalties or both. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, the rights may be non-exclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing galeterone, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. This could harm our business significantly.\nDefending against claims of patent infringement or misappropriation of trade secrets could be costly and time-consuming, regardless of the outcome. Most of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater resources. They are, therefore, likely to be able to sustain the costs of complex patent or trade secret litigation longer than we could. Thus, even if we were to ultimately prevail, or to settle at an early stage, such litigation could burden us with substantial unanticipated costs. In addition, litigation or threatened litigation could result in significant demands on the time and attention of our management team, distracting them from the pursuit of other company business. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our internal research programs, in-license needed technology, or enter into strategic partnerships that would help us bring our product candidates to market.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees or directors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nMany of our employees and certain of our directors were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees and directors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees or directors have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s or director\u2019s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nOur reliance on third parties requires us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed.\nBecause we rely on third parties in the discovery, development and manufacture of our product candidates, and because we collaborate with various organizations and academic institutions on the advancement of our\ntechnology, we must, at times, share trade secrets with them. We seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, collaborative research agreements, consulting agreements or other similar agreements with our collaborators, advisors, employees and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, such as trade secrets. Despite these contractual provisions, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by potential competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how and trade secrets, discovery by a third party of our trade secrets or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair our intellectual property rights and protections in our product candidates.\nEnforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition, our third-party agreements typically restrict the ability of our collaborators, advisors, employees and consultants to publish data potentially relating to our trade secrets. Our academic collaborators typically have rights to publish data, provided that we are notified in advance and may delay publication for a specified time in order to secure our intellectual property rights arising from the collaboration. In other cases, publication rights are controlled exclusively by us, although in some cases we may share these rights with other parties. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets, our competitors may discover our trade secrets, either through breach of these agreements, independent development or publication of information including our trade secrets in cases where we do not have proprietary or otherwise protected rights at the time of publication.\nRisks Related to Compliance Matters\nAny product candidate for which we receive marketing approval could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, if any of them are approved.\nAny product candidate for which we receive marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents. Even if regulatory approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off-label use and if we do not market our products for their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may have adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the marketing of a product;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on product distribution;\n\u2022\nrequirements to conduct post-marketing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwarning or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u2022\nrecall of products;\n\u2022\nfines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nrefusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure; or\n\u2022\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nOur relationships with customers and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, program exclusion, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we receive marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we receive marketing approval.\nRestrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:\n\u2022\nthe federal healthcare anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\nthe federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nthe federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n\u2022\nthe federal transparency requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, require manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to physician payments and other transfers of value and physician ownership and investment interests; and\n\u2022\nanalogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, and some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures.\nSome state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nRecently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize galeterone or other future products candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of galeterone or other future products candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we receive marketing approval.\nIn the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or Medicare Modernization Act, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class in certain cases. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this and other more recent legislation could decrease the coverage and reimbursement that is provided for any approved products. While the Medicare Modernization Act applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the Medicare Modernization Act or other more recent legislation may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for health care and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Effective October 1, 2010, the Health Care Reform Law revises the definition of \u201caverage manufacturer price\u201d for\nreporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states. Further, the new law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may affect our business practices with health care practitioners. We will not know the full effects of the Health Care Reform Law until applicable federal and state agencies issue regulations or guidance under the new law. Although it is too early to determine the effect of the Health Care Reform Law, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. In addition, there have been recent public announcements by members of the U.S. Congress and the new presidential administration regarding their plans to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Law. However, it remains unclear how a repeal or replacements of these programs might affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which regulatory approval is obtained.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of galeterone or our other future products candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain our chief executive officer and other key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on Jodie Morrison, our President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as the other members of our executive and scientific teams. Although we have formal employment agreements with each of our executive officers, these agreements do not prevent our executives from terminating their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any of our executives or other employees. The loss of the services of any of these persons could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nIn July 2016, we implemented a reduction in force, which impacted virtually all of our functions. As part of the reduction in force, Lee Kalowski, our former Chief Financial Officer, and Gerald Quirk, our former Executive Vice President, Business Operations and General Counsel, ceased their employment with us at the end of August 2016. In addition, Karen Ferrante, our former Chief Medical Officer, retired at the end of August 2016. With any change in leadership and reduction in force, there is a risk to retention of employees, as well as the potential for disruption to business operations, initiatives, plans and strategies.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nWe have recently reduced the size of our organization, and we may encounter difficulties in managing our business as a result of this reduction, or the attrition that may occur following this reduction, which could disrupt our operations. In addition, we may not achieve anticipated benefits and savings from the reduction.\nIn July 2016, we implemented a reduction in force that reduced the number of our employees by approximately 60 percent to a total of 10 full-time equivalent employees, and as of January 31, 2017, we had eight full-time employees. The reduction in force, and the attrition thereafter, resulted in the loss of longer-term employees, the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise and the reallocation and combination of certain of roles and responsibilities across the organization, all of which could adversely affect our operations. Given the complexity and nature of our business, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, manage our facilities and continue to recruit and retain qualified personnel. This will be made more challenging given the reduction in force described above and additional measures we may take to reduce costs. As a result, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day strategic and operational activities, and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these organizational changes. Further, the restructuring and possible additional cost containment measures may yield unintended consequences, such as attrition beyond our intended reduction in force and reduced employee morale. In addition, employees who were not affected by the reduction in force may seek alternate employment which would result in us seeking contract support at unplanned additional expense. In addition, we may not achieve anticipated benefits from the reduction in force. Due to our limited resources, we may not be able to effectively manage our operations or recruit and retain qualified personnel, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure and operations, risks that we may not be able to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. If our management is unable to effectively manage this transition and reduction in force and additional cost containment measures, our expenses may be more than expected, and we may not be able to implement our business strategy.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur executive officers, directors and principal stockholders maintain the ability to control all matters submitted to stockholders for approval.\nOur executive officers, directors and stockholders who own more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, together with their affiliates and related persons, in the aggregate, beneficially own shares representing approximately 65% of our common stock, based on the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2016. As a result, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they would be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For\nexample, these persons, if they choose to act together, would control the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company on terms that other stockholders may desire.\nWe believe our two largest stockholders, Apple Tree Partners and Novartis BioVentures, Ltd., in the aggregate, beneficially own shares representing approximately 55% of our common stock in the aggregate, based on the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2016. As a result, each of these stockholders acting individually, as well as together, may exercise significant control over our management and affairs. In particular, each of our directors and certain entities affiliated with Apple Tree Partners holding in the aggregate approximately 36.3% of our outstanding common stock have each entered into a support agreement in favor of Otic in connection with the Otic Transaction.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our corporate charter and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board are elected at one time;\n\u2022\nallow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nlimit the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from the board;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of directors;\n\u2022\nrequire that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u2022\nlimit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal certain provisions of our charter or bylaws.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained, and investors may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price they paid.\nAlthough we have listed our common stock on The NASDAQ Global Market, an active trading market for our shares may not be sustained. In the absence of an active trading market for our common stock, investors may\nnot be able to sell their common stock at or above the prices at which they acquired their shares or at the time that they would like to sell. An inactive trading market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration.\nOur stock price has been and may in the future be volatile, which could cause purchasers of our common stock to incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price has been and in the future may be subject to substantial volatility. The stock market in general and the market for biotechnology companies in particular has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. For example, our stock traded within a range of a high price of $30.00 per share and a low price of $0.73 per share for the period beginning September 17, 2014, our first day of trading on The NASDAQ Global Market, through January 31, 2017. Our stock price experienced significant volatility in July 2016 after we announced our plan to discontinue our ARMOR3-SV clinical trial. As a result of this volatility, our stockholders could incur substantial losses. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe outcome of our proposed Otic Transaction;\n\u2022\nour analysis of available unblinded data from our ARMOR3-SV trial and our determination as to the potential paths forward in the development of galeterone and our ARDA program;\n\u2022\nresults of clinical trials of galeterone and our future product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u2022\npotential approvals of galeterone or other future product candidates for marketing by the FDA or equivalent foreign regulatory authorities or our failure to obtain such approvals;\n\u2022\nregulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022\nthe results of our efforts to commercialize galeterone or other future product candidates;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe level of expenses related to galeterone or any of our future product candidates or clinical development programs;\n\u2022\nthe results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire or in-license additional product candidates or products;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors and issuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u2022\nthe other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nIn addition, pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant share price volatility in recent years, and securities class action litigation often follows a decline in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOn August 1, 2016, a purported stockholder filed a putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against us, Jodie P. Morrison, and Lee H. Kalowski, entitled Doshi v. Tokai Pharmaceuticals, Inc., et al., No. 1:16-cv-06106 (\u201cDoshi Action\u201d). The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of purchasers of our securities between June 24, 2015, and July 25, 2016, and alleges that, in violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, defendants made false and misleading statements and omissions about our clinical trials for our drug candidate, galeterone. The lawsuit seeks, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages, interest, costs, and attorneys\u2019 fees. On October 3, 2016, the case was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. A lead plaintiff has yet to be appointed.\nOn August 19, 2016, a purported stockholder filed a putative class action lawsuit in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Francisco, against us, Jodie P. Morrison, Lee H. Kalowski, Seth L. Harrison, Timothy J. Barberich, David A. Kessler, Joseph A. Yanchik, III, and the underwriters of our initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d), entitled Jackie888, Inc. v. Tokai Pharmaceuticals, Inc., et al., No. CGC-16-553796. The lawsuit alleges that, in violation of the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d), our registration statement for our IPO made false and misleading statements and omissions about our clinical trials for galeterone. The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of purchasers of our common stock in and/or traceable to our IPO. The lawsuit seeks, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages, interest, costs, and attorneys\u2019 fees. On October 19, 2016, the defendants moved to dismiss or stay the action on grounds of forum non conveniens, and certain individual defendants moved to quash the plaintiff\u2019s summons for lack of personal jurisdiction. On February 27, 2017, the Superior Court entered an order granting defendants\u2019 motion to stay the lawsuit.\nOn September 29, 2016, two purported stockholders filed a putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against us, Jodie Pope Morrison, Lee H. Kalowski, Seth L. Harrison, Timothy J. Barberich, David A. Kessler, Joseph A. Yanchik, III, and the underwriters of our IPO, entitled Garbowski, et al. v. Tokai Pharmaceuticals, Inc., et al., No. 1:16-cv-11963 (\u201cGarbowski Action\u201d). The lawsuit alleges that the defendants and our registration statement for our IPO made false and misleading statements and omissions about our clinical trials for galeterone, in violation of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5. The plaintiffs seek to represent a class of purchasers of our common stock in or traceable to our IPO as well as a class of purchasers of our common stock between September 17, 2014, and July 25, 2016. The lawsuit seeks, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages, interest, costs, and attorneys\u2019 fees. The plaintiff in the Doshi Action has filed a motion to consolidate the Doshi and Garbowski Actions for all purposes. A prospective lead plaintiff has filed a motion to consolidate the Doshi and Garbowski Actions for all purposes. A lead plaintiff has yet to be appointed.\nOn December 5, 2016, a putative securities class action was filed in the Business Litigation Session of the Superior Court Department of the Suffolk County Trial Court, Massachusetts (\u201cMassachusetts State Court\u201d) against us, Jodie P. Morrison, Lee H. Kalowski, Seth L. Harrison, Timothy J. Barberich, David A. Kessler, Joseph A. Yanchik, III, and the underwriters of our IPO, entitled Wu v. Tokai Pharmaceuticals, Inc., et al., 16-3725 BLS (\u201cWu Action\u201d). The lawsuit alleges that our IPO registration statement made false and misleading statements and omissions about our clinical trials for galeterone, in violation of the Securities Act. The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of purchasers of our common stock in or traceable to our IPO. The lawsuit seeks, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages, interest, costs, and attorneys\u2019 fees. On December 19, 2016, defendants removed the Wu Action to the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, where it was captioned Wu v. Tokai Pharmaceuticals, Inc., et al., 16-cv-12550, and assigned to the same judge presiding over the Doshi and Garbowski Actions. On December 22, 2016, defendants filed a motion to consolidate the Wu Action with the Doshi and Garbowski Actions. On January 6, 2017, plaintiff filed a motion to remand the Wu Action to Massachusetts State Court.\nAn unfavorable resolution of any of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe must maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, and if we are unable to do so, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nWe must maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in order to accurately and timely report our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, as a public company, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, requires, among other things, that we assess the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures quarterly and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at the end of each fiscal year.\nThe rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. These standards require that our audit committee be advised and regularly updated on management\u2019s review of internal control over financial reporting. Our management may not be able to effectively and timely implement controls and procedures that adequately respond to the increased regulatory compliance and reporting requirements that are applicable to us as a public company. If we fail to staff our accounting and finance function adequately or maintain internal control over financial reporting adequate to meet the demands that are placed upon us as a public company, including the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our business and reputation may be harmed and our stock price may decline. Furthermore, investor perceptions of us may be adversely affected, which could cause a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and may remain an emerging growth company for up to five years from the date of our initial public offering, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and plan to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be the sole source of gain for our stockholders.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, the terms of existing or any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for our stockholders for the foreseeable future.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. The price of our common stock could decline if we do not obtain research analyst coverage, or one or more securities analysts downgrade our common stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business.", "PERMNO": 14937, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "NVUS"}
