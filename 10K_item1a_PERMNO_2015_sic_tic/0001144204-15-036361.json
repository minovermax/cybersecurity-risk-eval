{"cik": "1574235", "company": "Ruthigen, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-06-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nYou should consider carefully the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included or incorporated in this report. If any of the following risks, either alone or taken together, or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to not be significant, develop into actual events, then our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected. If that happens, the market price of our common stock could decline, and stockholders may lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are a development stage company with no commercial products.\nWe are developing RUT58-60, our lead drug candidate, initially for the prevention of infection associated with abdominal surgery. We currently have no products approved for sale. We submitted our IND, for RUT58-60 to the FDA in early May 2014. In June 2014, Our IND became effective thereby allowing us to begin human clinical testing of RUT58-60. In July 2014, we began human clinical testing of RUT58-60 in a 21-day skin irritation trial. In August 2014, we completed the skin irritation trial with 36 human subjects participating for 21 consecutive days. In October 2014, we initiated the Phase 1/2 clinical trial, and, in November 2014, we began patient enrollment in the Phase 1 portion of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of our lead drug candidate, RUT58-60, for use as an adjunct to systemic antibiotics in abdominal surgery and patient screening began at four clinical trial sites in the United States. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we may scale down our operations, including scaling back patient enrollment in our clinical trial to evaluate the safety of RUT58-60 within the abdominal cavity.\nWe are heavily dependent on the success of our drug candidates and we cannot provide any assurance that our lead drug candidate, RUT58-60, or other product candidates will be commercialized.\nOur future success depends heavily on our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize our drug candidates, which may never occur. We currently generate no revenues and incur substantial losses and we may never be able to develop or commercialize a marketable drug.\nBefore we generate any revenues from product sales, we must complete preclinical studies and clinical trials, establish manufacturing capabilities that comply with the FDA\u2019s cGMP requirements for manufacturing sterile drugs, receive approval from the FDA in the United States and other regulatory agencies in foreign jurisdictions, build a commercial organization, make substantial investments and undertake significant marketing efforts alone or in partnership with others. We will not be permitted to market or promote RUT58-60 or other product candidates, before we receive regulatory approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and we may never receive such regulatory approval for any of its product candidates.\nWe have not previously submitted a BLA or a NDA to the FDA, or similar drug approval filings to comparable foreign authorities, for any product candidate. We cannot be certain that our lead drug candidate or any other product candidate will be successful in clinical trials or receive regulatory approval. Further, our lead drug candidate or any other product candidate may not receive regulatory approval even if our clinical trials are successful. If we do not receive regulatory approvals for our drug candidates, we may not be able to continue our operations. Even if we successfully obtain regulatory approvals to market our lead drug candidate or any other product candidate, our revenues will be dependent, in part, upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval and have commercial rights. If the markets for patient subsets that we are targeting are not as significant as we estimate, we may not generate significant revenues from sales of such products, if approved.\nWe have has licensed RUT58-60 for development and commercialization in the United States, Canada, Europe and Japan. While the scope of regulatory approval is similar in other countries, to obtain separate regulatory approval in many other countries we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of such countries regarding safety and efficacy, clinical trials and commercial sales, pricing and distribution of our lead drug candidate or any other product candidate, and we cannot predict success in these jurisdictions.\nClinical trials involve a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nDrug candidates that we pursue will be subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and other regulatory agencies in foreign jurisdictions, including activities related to preclinical studies, human clinical trials, manufacturing, labeling, packaging and sterilization, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, export, import, marketing and distribution and other possible activities.\nOur lead drug candidate, RUT58-60, is a proprietary formulation of HOCl, and we believe it has unique features and properties that will differentiate it from other HOCl formulations that are marketed as topical products and regulated by the FDA as medical devices under 510(k) clearances. We expect to pursue FDA drug approval for RUT58-60 as a new chemical entity. There may be other HOCl drug candidates in development by other companies and these candidates may gain FDA drug approval prior to RUT58-60. We have has conducted a number of pre-clinical tests using RUT58-60 in support of the IND for RUT58-60, which was submitted to the FDA in early May 2014. In June 2014, our IND became effective thereby allowing us to begin human clinical testing of RUT58-60. In July 2014, we began human clinical testing of RUT58-60 in a 21-day skin irritation trial. In August 2014, we completed the skin irritation trial with 36 human subjects participating for 21 consecutive days. In October 2014, we initiated the Phase 1/2 clinical trial, and, in November 2014, we began patient enrollment in the Phase 1 portion of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of our lead drug candidate, RUT58-60, for use as an adjunct to systemic antibiotics in abdominal surgery and patient screening began at our clinical trial sites in the United States. If and when, we move through the regulatory process, the FDA may make other suggestions that may impact our ability to complete our clinical trials within the timeframe or budget that we anticipate, which could impact investors\u2019 interest in our business and our stock price.\nThe results of preclinical studies and clinical trials of previously published HOCl based products may not necessarily be indicative of the results of its future clinical trials. The design of our clinical trials is based on many assumptions about the expected effects of HOCl used historically in the industry and if those assumptions are incorrect, the trials may not produce statistically significant results. Preliminary results may not be confirmed upon full analysis of the detailed results of an early clinical trial. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show safety and efficacy sufficient to support intended use claims despite having progressed through initial clinical trials. The data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere. Because of the uncertainties associated with drug development and regulatory approval, we cannot determine if, or when, we may have an approved product for commercialization or whether we will ever achieve sales or profits of RUT58-60 or other product candidates we may pursue in the future.\nWe may be subject to extensive regulations and may not obtain marketing approvals for products in Europe and other jurisdictions.\nIn addition to regulations in the United States, should we or our collaborators pursue marketing approvals for RUT58-60 or its other drug candidates internationally, we and our collaborators will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of its products. Whether or not we, or our collaborators, obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country.\nWe expect to pursue marketing approvals for RUT58-60 in Europe and other jurisdictions outside the United States with collaborative partners. The time and process required to obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in Europe and other jurisdictions may be different from those in the United States regulatory and approval in one jurisdiction does not ensure approvals in any other jurisdiction; however, negative regulatory decisions in any jurisdiction may have a negative impact on the regulatory process in other jurisdictions.\nIf we, or our collaborators, fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.\nWe have limited knowledge and experience with NDA studies and product applications and we may not be successful in obtaining FDA approvals for our drug candidates.\nCurrently, we have no products approved for sale. We have not submitted an application or obtained any FDA approval for any product through the NDA process. This lack of previous experience with NDA processes and requirements may impede our ability to obtain FDA approval in a timeframe consistent with our expectations and plans, or at all, for its drug candidates. Failure to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements, either before or after product approval, may subject us to sanctions, including: warning letters, deficiency notifications, application denials, approval denials, requirements for additional pre-clinical and/or clinical studies, civil and/or criminal penalties, injunctions or suspensions of production, black box warnings and other product label requirements, loss of product approvals, product seizures, or recalls.\nIf our products do not gain market acceptance, our business will suffer because we may not be able to fund future operations.\nA number of factors may affect the market acceptance of our products or any other products we develop or acquire, including:\n\u2022 the price of our products relative to other products for the same or similar treatments;\n\u2022 the perception by patients, physicians and other members of the health care community of the effectiveness and safety of our products for their indicated applications and treatments;\n\u2022 our ability to fund our sales and marketing efforts; and\n\u2022 the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.\nIf our products do not gain market acceptance, we may not be able to fund future operations, including developing, testing and obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidates and expanding our sales and marketing efforts for any approved products, which would cause our business to suffer.\nOur research and development program for drug candidates other than RUT58-60 is at an early stage, and we cannot be certain our development activities will result in the commercialization of any drug.\nExcept for our development program for RUT58-60, our research and development program targeting non-infectious open surgery indications is at an early stage. Any product candidates we develop will require significant additional research and development efforts prior to commercial sale, including extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval. This may require increases in spending on internal projects, the acquisition of third party technologies or products, and other types of investments. We cannot be sure that our approach to drug discovery, acting independently or with partners, will be effective or will result in the development of any drug. We cannot expect that any drug candidates that do result from our research and development efforts will be commercially available for many years.\nWe have limited experience in conducting pre-clinical testing and clinical trials. Even if we receive initially positive clinical trial results, those results will not mean that similar results will be obtained in the later stages of drug development. Our drug candidates are prone to the risks of failure inherent in pharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that none of our drug candidates will be:\n\u2022 safe, non-toxic and effective;\n\u2022 approved by regulatory authorities;\n\u2022 developed into a commercially viable drug;\n\u2022 manufactured or produced economically;\n\u2022 successfully marketed; or\n\u2022 accepted widely by customers.\nWe are dependent on a third party manufacturing organization to fulfill our manufacturing needs, our development of RUT58-60, and our commercialization of RUT58-60, if and when RUT58-60 receives regulatory approval, could be stopped or delayed or made less profitable if third party manufacturers fail to provide us with sufficient quantities at acceptable prices.\nThe manufacture of biotechnology and pharmaceutical products is complex and requires significant expertise, capital investment, process controls and know-how. Common difficulties in biotechnology and pharmaceutical manufacturing may include: sourcing and producing raw materials, transferring technology from chemistry and development activities to production activities, validating initial production designs, scaling manufacturing techniques, improving costs and yields, establishing and maintaining quality controls and stability requirements, eliminating contaminations and operator errors, and maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements. We currently rely on a third party organization to manufacture RUT58-60 and we have no independent experience in manufacturing and cannot assure you that any clinical-grade product will ever be produced or that we, or our other third party manufacturers on which we may rely in the future will maintain operations necessary to continue to produce clinical-grade product for us. We lack the facilities and personnel to manufacture products in accordance with cGMP prescribed by the FDA or to produce an adequate supply of compounds to meet future requirements for clinical trials and commercialization of RUT58-60. Drug manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection before the FDA will issue an approval to market a new drug product, and all of the manufacturers that we intend to use must adhere to the cGMP regulations prescribed by the FDA.\nOur shared services agreement with Oculus, which covered our manufacturing arrangement with Oculus, was terminated effective April 6, 2015. We previously relied on Oculus to manufacture, and prepare for shipment, RUT58-60, out of its Petaluma, California, facility for its preclinical studies and Phase 1/2 clinical trial. We did not control the manufacturing processes of Oculus and have been dependent on Oculus for the production of RUT58-60 in accordance with cGMP, which include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation.\nWe may choose, or be forced, to terminate our manufacturing arrangement with the third party manufacturing organization if it:\n\u2022 does not perform as agreed;\n\u2022 is not capable of producing or processing sufficient quantities of our drug candidates;\n\u2022 is not able to manufacture materials that conform to our specifications;\n\u2022 is not able to hire or retain the necessary employees; and\n\u2022 is unable to comply with cGMP requirements and with FDA, state and foreign regulatory requirements, and does not pass regulatory inspections.\nManufacturers are periodically subject to inspections by various regulatory agencies, some of which may be unannounced. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have the ability to issue warning letters and sanctions against manufacturers based upon deficiencies noted during inspections of facilities or based upon material defects in the product label, design, production, or distribution. In addition, we have no control over the ability or willingness of our third party manufacturer to comply with regulatory requirements, maintain adequate quality controls and processes, or maintain qualified personnel. Loss of our third party manufacturer may adversely affect our ability to meet our requirements to conduct clinical trials, secure and maintain regulatory approvals, and meet commercialization targets that we may establish in the future.\nWe have secured manufacturing capabilities through a third party contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, that complies with the FDA\u2019s cGMP requirements for manufacturing sterile drugs. Our ability to transfer our manufacturing to a CMO is dependent on our ability to transfer technology and know-how, assist the CMO to pass regulatory inspections and gain necessary certifications and clearances, and continue to work with the CMO to maintain a compliant manufacturing facility. In the future, we may establish an independent manufacturing facility to conduct our Phase 3 clinical trial and, if the drug is approved, for our initial commercial supplies; however, we can give no assurances that we will be able to do so or to maintain a self-directed manufacturing facility. In order to establish an in-house manufacturing facility, we would be required to transfer manufacturing processes, acquire manufacturing equipment, and transfer know-how as required to satisfy various regulatory requirements. We can offer no assurances that we would be able to enter into any definitive agreements on acceptable terms for the expanded development and commercial scale manufacturing of RUT58-60 with any other third party manufacturers or establish an independent manufacturing facility. Any supply disruptions may cause significant delays in clinical trials and negatively impact commercial efforts, which may have an adverse effect on the value of our stock.\nWe and/or our third party manufacturers may be adversely affected by developments outside of our control, and these developments may delay or prevent further manufacturing of our products. Adverse developments may include labor disputes, resource constraints, shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, unexpected sources of contamination, laws related to our manufacturing techniques, equipment used during manufacturing, or composition of matter, unstable political environments, acts of terrorism, war, natural disasters, and other natural and man-made disasters. If we or our third party manufacturers encounters any of the above difficulties, or otherwise fail to comply with contractual obligations, our ability to provide any product for clinical trial or commercial purposes would be jeopardized. This may increase the costs associated with completing our clinical trials and commercial production. Further, production disruptions may cause us to terminate ongoing clinical trials and/or commence new clinical trials at additional expense. We may also have to take inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expenses for products that fail to meet specifications or pass safety inspections. If production difficulties cannot be solved with acceptable costs, expenses, and timeframes, we may be forced to abandon our clinical development and commercialization plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and the value of our securities.\nWe may be unable to obtain sufficient clinical trial liability insurance.\nOur inability to obtain and retain sufficient clinical trial liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential liability claims could prevent or inhibit our ability to conduct clinical trials for product candidates we develop. We expect to obtain clinical trial liability insurance; however, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. We expects we will supplement our clinical trial coverage with product liability coverage in connection with the commercial launch of RUT58-60 or other product candidates we develop in the future; however, we may be unable to obtain such increased coverage on acceptable terms or at all. If we are found liable in a clinical trial lawsuit or a product liability lawsuit in the future, we will have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts.\nWe may need to increase the size of our organization and the scope of our outside vendor relationships, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.\nAs of June 5, 2015, we employed a total of five full-time employees. Our current internal departments include finance, research and development and administration. We are led by a team that includes two executives, a Director of Regulatory and Quality Assurance and two operations specialists.\nWe may expand our management team to include an operation ramp up of additional technical staff required to achieve our business objectives. We may need to expand our managerial, operational, technical and scientific, financial and other resources in order to manage our operations and clinical trials, establish independent manufacturing, continue our research and development activities, and commercialize our product candidate. Our management and scientific personnel, systems and facilities currently in place may not be adequate to support our future growth.\nOur need to effectively manage our operations, growth and various projects requires that we:\n\u2022 manage our clinical trials effectively, including our planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial of RUT58-60;\n\u2022 manage our internal development efforts effectively while carrying out our contractual obligations to licensors, contractors and other third parties;\n\u2022 continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures; and\n\u2022 attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees.\nWe may utilize the services of third party vendors to perform tasks including pre-clinical and clinical trial management, statistics and analysis, regulatory affairs, medical advisory, market research, formulation development, Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls, or CMC, activities, other drug development functions, legal, auditing, financial advisory, and investor relations. Our growth strategy may also entail expanding our group of contractors or consultants to implement these and other tasks going forward. Because we rely on numerous consultants to outsource many key functions of our business, we will need to be able to effectively manage these consultants to ensure that they successfully carry out their contractual obligations and meet expected deadlines. However, if we are unable to effectively manage our outsourced activities or if the quality or accuracy of the services provided by consultants is compromised for any reason, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidate or otherwise advance our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our existing consultants or find other competent outside contractors and consultants on economically reasonable terms, or at all. If we are not able to effectively expand our organization by hiring new employees and expanding our groups of consultants and contractors, we may be unable to successfully implement the tasks necessary to further develop and commercialize our product candidate and, accordingly, may not achieve our research, development and commercialization goals.\nIf we are unable to develop satisfactory sales and marketing capabilities, it may not succeed in commercializing RUT58-60 or any other product candidate.\nWe have no experience in marketing and selling drug products. We have not entered into any sales and marketing arrangements for our drug candidates. We are developing our drug candidates for large patient populations served by surgeons. These patient populations may number in the millions. Typically, pharmaceutical companies would employ groups of sales representatives and associated sales and marketing staff numbering in the hundreds to thousands of individuals to call on this large number of physicians and hospitals. We may seek to collaborate with a third party to market our drugs or may seek to market and sell our drugs by ourselves. If we seeks to collaborate with a third party, we cannot be sure that a collaborative agreement can be reached on terms acceptable to it. If we seek to market and sell our drugs directly, we will need to hire additional personnel skilled in marketing and sales. We cannot be sure that we will be able to acquire, or establish third party relationships to provide, any or all of these marketing and sales capabilities. The establishment of a direct sales force or a contract sales force or a combination direct and contract sales force to market our products will be expensive and time-consuming and could delay any product launch. Further, we can give no assurances that it may be able to maintain a direct and/or contract sales force for any period of time or that our sales efforts will be sufficient to grow our revenues or that our sales efforts will ever lead to profits.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approvals to commercialize RUT58-60 or any other drug, its drug candidates may not be accepted by physicians or the medical community in general.\nThere can be no assurance that RUT58-60 or any other product candidate successfully developed by us, independently or with partners, will be accepted by physicians, hospitals and other health care facilities. RUT58-60 and any future product candidates we develop will compete with a number of anti-infective drugs and antiseptic and cleansing products manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical and medical technology companies. The degree of market acceptance of any drug candidates we develop depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 our demonstration of the clinical efficacy and safety of such drugs;\n\u2022 timing of market approval and commercial launch of such drugs;\n\u2022 the clinical indication(s) for which such drugs are approved;\n\u2022 product label and package insert requirements;\n\u2022 advantages and disadvantages of our product candidates compared to existing therapies;\n\u2022 continued interest in and growth of the market for anti-infective drugs;\n\u2022 strength of sales, marketing, and distribution support;\n\u2022 product pricing in absolute terms and relative to alternative treatments;\n\u2022 future changes in health care laws, regulations, and medical policies; and\n\u2022 availability of reimbursement codes and coverage in select jurisdictions, and future changes to reimbursement policies of government and third party payors.\nSignificant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.\nOur failure to successfully acquire, develop and market additional drug candidates or approved drug products could impair our ability to grow.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may evaluate, acquire, license, develop and/or market additional product candidates and technologies. However, our internal research capabilities are limited, and we may be dependent upon pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic scientists and other researchers to sell or license products or technology to us. The success of this strategy depends partly upon our ability to identify, select and acquire promising pharmaceutical product candidates and products. The process of proposing, negotiating and implementing a license or acquisition of a product candidate or approved product is lengthy and complex. Other companies, including some with substantially greater financial, marketing and sales resources, may compete with us for the license or acquisition of product candidates and approved products. We have limited resources to identify and execute the acquisition or in-licensing of third party products, businesses and technologies and integrate them into our current infrastructure. Moreover, we may devote resources to potential acquisitions or in-licensing opportunities that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts. We may not be able to acquire the rights to additional product candidates on terms that we find acceptable, or at all.\nIn addition, future acquisitions may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:\n\u2022 exposure to unknown liabilities;\n\u2022 disruption of our business and diversion of our management\u2019s and technical personnel\u2019s time and attention to develop acquired products or technologies;\n\u2022 incurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of securities to pay for acquisitions;\n\u2022 higher than expected acquisition and integration costs;\n\u2022 increased amortization expenses;\n\u2022 difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel;\n\u2022 impairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership; and\n\u2022 inability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses.\nAny product candidate that we acquire may require additional development efforts prior to commercial sale, including extensive clinical testing and approval by the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities. All product candidates are prone to risks of failure typical of pharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that a product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that any products that we develop or approved products that we acquire will be manufactured profitably or achieve market acceptance.\nWe may not be able to attract, retain, or manage highly qualified personnel, which could adversely impact our business.\nOur future success and ability to compete in the biopharmaceutical industry is substantially dependent on our ability to identify, attract, and retain highly qualified key managerial, scientific, medical, and operations personnel. The market for key employees in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries can be competitive. The loss of the services of any of our key employees without an adequate replacement or our inability to hire new employees as needed could delay our product development efforts, harm our ability to sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business.\nThe scientific, research and development personnel upon which we rely to operate our business have expertise in certain aspects of drug discovery, clinical development and regulatory affairs, and it may be difficult to retain or replace these individuals. We currently conduct our operations at our facilities in Santa Rosa, California, within the greater San Francisco Bay Area, and this region is headquarters to many other biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and medical technology companies, as well as many academic and research institutions, and, therefore, we face increased competition for technical and managerial personnel in this region.\nIn addition, we have scientific, medical and clinical advisors who assist us in designing and formulating our products and with development and clinical strategies. These advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us, or may have arrangements with other companies to assist in the development of products that may compete with our business.\nDespite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management and scientific and development teams may terminate their employment with us on short notice. Although we have written employment agreements with our executive officers, these employment agreements provide for at-will employment, which means that our executive officers can leave our employment at any time, with or without notice. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or our other key employees, and our inability to find suitable replacements could potentially harm our business, financial condition and prospects. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies on the lives of these individuals or the lives of any of our other employees.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with any regulations applicable to us, to provide accurate information to regulatory authorities, to comply with manufacturing standards we may have established, to comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, or to report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risk.\nBusiness interruptions could adversely affect our future operations, revenues, and financial conditions, and may increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations, and those of our directors, advisors, contractors, consultants, CROs, and collaborators, could be adversely affected by earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, extreme weather conditions, fires, water shortages, power failures, business systems failures, medical epidemics and other natural and man-made disaster or business interruptions. Our telephones, electronic devices and computer systems and those of our directors, advisors, contractors, consultants, CROs, and collaborators are vulnerable to damages, theft and accidental loss, negligence, unauthorized access, terrorism, war, electronic and telecommunications failures, and other natural and man-made disasters. Our headquarters are in Santa Rosa, California and may be subject to risks particularly those that are characteristic of the region such as earthquakes, wildfires, shipping and port delays and closures, flooding, fog, and other natural and man-made events that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Operating as a virtual company, our employees conduct business outside of our headquarters and leased or owned facilities. These locations may be subject to additional security and other risk factors due to the limited control of our employees. If such an event as described above were to occur in the future, it may cause interruptions in our operations, delay research and development programs, clinical trials, regulatory activities, manufacturing and quality assurance activities, sales and marketing activities, hiring, training of employees and persons within associated third parties, and other business activities.\nLikewise, we relies on third parties to manufacture RUT58-60 and conduct clinical trials, and similar events as those described in the prior paragraph relating to their business systems, equipment and facilities could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of our product candidate could be delayed or altogether terminated.\nIf the Merger is consummated, the business operations, strategies and focus of Ruthigen will fundamentally change, and these changes may not result in an improvement in the value of its common stock.\nPending the consummation of the Merger, the Merger Agreement permits us to scale down our operations as we deem necessary and requires us to scale back patient enrollment in our clinical trial of RUT58-60, our primary drug candidate, and it is currently anticipated that the combined company would focus its resources on the development of products within the scope of Pulmatrix\u2019s current business plan. As a result, following the Merger, the combined company may seek to sell or assign its rights related to our current drug candidates, including RUT58-60. If completed, any such sale or assignment may be at a substantial discount, the consideration received may not accurately represent the value of the assets sold or assigned and stockholders may not participate in the future prospects of such drug candidates.\nFollowing the Merger, it is expected that the combined company\u2019s primary products will be PUR1900, Pulmatrix\u2019s lead anti-infective product candidate, PUR0200, Pulmatrix\u2019s bronchodilator therapy candidate and Pulmatrix\u2019s other iSPERSE-based product candidates. Consequently, if the Merger is consummated, an investment in Ruthigen\u2019s common stock will primarily represent an investment in the business operations, strategies and focus of Pulmatrix. All of Pulmatrix\u2019s product candidates are still under development and may never be approved for sale or successfully commercialized. The failure to successfully commercialize one or more of Pulmatrix\u2019s current product candidates will significantly diminish the anticipated benefits of the Merger and have a material adverse effect on the business of the combined company. We cannot assure you that Ruthigen\u2019s business operations, strategies or focus will be successful following the Merger, and the Merger could depress the value of Ruthigen\u2019s common stock.\nRisks Related to Development and Regulatory Approval of RUT58-60 and Our Product Candidates\nWe cannot be certain that RUT58-60 or any of our future product candidates will receive regulatory approval, and without regulatory approval we will not be able to market our product candidates.\nOur business currently depends on the successful development and commercialization of RUT58-60. Our ability to generate revenue related to product sales, if ever, will depend on the successful development and regulatory approval of RUT58-60 for the prevention of infection associated with abdominal surgery and other indications and our future product candidates.\nWe currently have no products approved for sale and we cannot guarantee that we will ever have marketable products. The development of a product candidate and issues relating to our approval and marketing are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and regulatory authorities in other countries, with regulations differing from country to country. We are not permitted to market our product candidates in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA from the FDA. We have not submitted any marketing applications for any of our product candidates.\nNDA\u2019s must include extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and effectiveness for each desired indication. NDA\u2019s must also include significant information regarding the CMC for the product. Obtaining approval of an NDA is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and we may not be successful in obtaining approval. The FDA review processes can take years to complete and approval is never guaranteed. If we submit an NDA to the FDA, the FDA must decide whether to accept or reject the submission for filing. We cannot be certain that any submissions will be accepted for filing and review by the FDA.\nRegulators of other jurisdictions have their own procedures for approval of product candidates. Even if a product is approved, the FDA may limit the indications for which the product may be marketed, require extensive warnings on the product labeling or require expensive and time-consuming clinical trials or reporting as conditions of approval. Regulatory authorities in countries outside of the United States also have requirements for approval of drug candidates with which we must comply prior to marketing in those countries. Obtaining regulatory approval for marketing of a product candidate in one country does not ensure that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval in any other country. In addition, delays in approvals or rejections of marketing applications in the United States or other countries may be based upon many factors, including regulatory requests for additional analyses, reports, data, preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory questions regarding different interpretations of data and results, changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development and the emergence of new information regarding our product candidates or other products. Also, regulatory approval for any of our product candidates may be withdrawn.\nWe cannot predict whether our future trials and studies will be successful or whether regulators will agree with our conclusions regarding the preclinical studies and clinical trials it has conducted to date. If we are unable to obtain approval from the FDA or other regulatory agencies for RUT58-60 and our other product candidates, or if, subsequent to approval, we are unable to successfully commercialize RUT58-60 or our other product candidates, we will not be able to generate sufficient revenue to become profitable or to continue our operations.\nClinical trials for our product candidates are expensive, time-consuming, uncertain and susceptible to change, delay or termination.\nClinical trials are very expensive, time-consuming and difficult to design and implement. Even if the results of our clinical trials are favorable, clinical trials usually continue for several years and may take significantly longer to complete. In addition, we, the FDA, an Institutional Review Board, or other regulatory authorities, including state and local, may suspend, delay or terminate our clinical trials at any time for various reasons, including:\n\u2022 lack of effectiveness of our lead drug candidate or any other product candidate during clinical trials;\n\u2022 discovery of serious or unexpected toxicities or side effects experienced by study participants or other safety issues;\n\u2022 slower than expected rates of subject recruitment and enrollment rates in clinical trials;\n\u2022 delays or inability in manufacturing or obtaining sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials due to regulatory and manufacturing constraints;\n\u2022 inadequacy of or changes in our manufacturing process or product formulation;\n\u2022 delays in obtaining regulatory authorization to commence a study, including \u201cclinical holds\u201d or delays requiring suspension or termination of a study by a regulatory agency, such as the FDA, before or after a study is commenced;\n\u2022 changes in applicable regulatory policies and regulations;\n\u2022 delay or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable terms in clinical trial contracts or protocols with prospective clinical trial sites;\n\u2022 delay or failure to supply product for use in clinical trials which conforms to regulatory specification;\n\u2022 unfavorable results from ongoing clinical trials and pre-clinical studies;\n\u2022 failure of our contract research organizations, or CROs, or other third-party contractors to comply with all contractual requirements or to perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner;\n\u2022 failure by us, our employees, our CROs or their employees to comply with all applicable FDA or other regulatory requirements relating to the conduct of clinical trials or the handling, storage, security and recordkeeping for controlled substances;\n\u2022 scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions; and\n\u2022 failure to design appropriate clinical trial protocols.\nAny of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThere is a high rate of failure for drug candidates proceeding through clinical trials.\nGenerally, there is a high rate of failure for drug candidates proceeding through clinical trials. We may suffer significant setbacks in our clinical trials similar to the experience of a number of other companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, even after receiving promising results in earlier trials. Further, even if we view the results of a clinical trial to be positive, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of the data. In the event that we obtain negative results from our current of future clinical trials or receive poor clinical results for other product candidates, or the FDA chooses to block progress of the trials due to potential CMC issues or other hurdles or does not approve our NDA for RUT58-60, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue or obtain financing to continue our operations, our ability to execute on our current business plan will be materially impaired, our reputation in the industry would likely be significantly damaged and the price of our stock would likely decrease significantly.\nSerious adverse events or other safety risks could require us to abandon development and preclude, delay or limit approval of our product candidates, or limit the scope of any approved label or market acceptance.\nIf RUT58-60 or any of our product candidates, prior to or after any approval for commercial sale, cause serious or unexpected side effects, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials;\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may deny regulatory approval of our product candidates;\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or impose restrictions on our distribution in the form of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS;\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications or limitations on the indications for use;\n\u2022 we may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical trials;\n\u2022 we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; or\n\u2022 our reputation may suffer.\nWe may voluntarily suspend or terminate our planned clinical trials if at any time we believe that they present an unacceptable risk to participants or if preliminary data demonstrate that our product candidates are unlikely to receive regulatory approval or unlikely to be successfully commercialized. In addition, regulatory agencies, institutional review boards or data safety monitoring boards may at any time order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials or request that we cease using investigators in the clinical trials if they believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, or that they present an unacceptable safety risk to participants. If we elect or are forced to suspend or terminate any planned clinical trial of RUT58-60 or any other of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for that product will be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue from that product may be delayed or eliminated. Furthermore, any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates and impair our ability to generate revenue from the commercialization of these products.\nAny failure by us to comply with existing regulations could harm our reputation and operating results.\nWe will be subject to extensive regulation by U.S. federal and state and foreign governments in each of the markets where we intend to sell RUT58-60, or any other drug candidate, if and after it is approved. For example, we will have to adhere to all regulatory requirements including the FDA\u2019s current GCP, GLP and cGMP requirements. If we fail to comply with applicable regulations, including FDA pre-or post-approval cGMP requirements, then the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities could sanction us. Even if a drug is FDA-approved, regulatory authorities may impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-marketing studies.\nIf RUT58-60, or any other drug candidate, is approved in the United States, it will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping and submission of safety and other post-market information, including both federal and state requirements in the United States. In addition, manufacturers and manufacturers\u2019 facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP. As such, we and our contract manufacturers are subject to continual review and periodic inspections to assess compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production and quality control. We will also be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved label. As such, we may not promote our products for indications or uses for which they do not have FDA approval.\nIf a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, or disagrees with the promotion, marketing or labeling of the product, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product or on us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency or enforcement authority may:\n\u2022 issue warning letters;\n\u2022 impose civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022 suspend regulatory approval;\n\u2022 suspend any of our ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022 refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications submitted by us;\n\u2022 impose restrictions on our operations, including closing our contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities; or\n\u2022 seize or detain products or require a product recall.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response, and could generate negative publicity. Any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and generate revenue from RUT58-60 and our product candidates. If regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is withdrawn, the value of our company and our operating results will be adversely affected. Additionally, if we are unable to generate revenue from sales of RUT58-60, or any other drug candidate, our potential for achieving profitability will be diminished and the capital necessary to fund our operations will be increased.\nAny action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation. We expend significant resources on compliance efforts and such expenses are unpredictable and might adversely affect our results. Changing laws, regulations and standards might also create uncertainty, higher expenses and increase insurance costs.\nIf we are found in violation of federal or state \u201cfraud and abuse\u201d laws, we may be required to pay a penalty and/or be suspended from participation in federal or state health care programs, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the United States, we will be subject to various federal and state health care \u201cfraud and abuse\u201d laws, including anti-kickback laws, false claims laws and other laws intended to reduce fraud and abuse in federal and state health care programs, which could affect it, particularly upon successful commercialization of our products in the United States. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on our behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order or prescription of a particular drug for which payment may be made under a federal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Under federal government regulations, some arrangements, known as safe harbors, are deemed not to violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Although we seek to structure our business arrangements in compliance with all applicable requirements, these laws are broadly written, and it is often difficult to determine precisely how the law will be applied in specific circumstances. Accordingly, it is possible that our practices may be challenged under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willfully presenting or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers, including government payers, claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services that were not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Cases have been brought under false claims laws alleging that off-label promotion of pharmaceutical products or the provision of kickbacks has resulted in the submission of false claims to governmental health care programs. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, we are prohibited from knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payers, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and/or exclusion or suspension from federal and state health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions on behalf of the government under the federal False Claims Act as well as under the false claims laws of several states.\nMany states have adopted laws similar to the federal anti-kickback statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for health care services reimbursed by any source, not just governmental payers. Neither the government nor the courts have provided definitive guidance on the application of fraud and abuse laws to our business. Law enforcement authorities are increasingly focused on enforcing these laws, and if we are found in violation of one of these laws, we could be required to pay a penalty and could be suspended or excluded from participation in federal or state health care programs, and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe expect to face competition, often from companies with greater resources and experience.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid change. The industry continues to expand and evolve as an increasing number of competitors and potential competitors enter the market. Many of these competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, managerial and research and development resources and experience than us. Some of these competitors and potential competitors have more experience than we do in the development of pharmaceutical products, including validation procedures and regulatory matters. We are aware of three companies in the United States and/or Europe that produce HOCl based products intended for medical applications, including Novabay, Oculus and Puricore, which we consider our potential competitors in this regard. In addition, many other companies have commercialized or are developing antibiotics that aim to address the increasingly growing concern of post-surgical infections, including Achaogen, Basilea, Cempra, Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Durata Therapeutics, Forest Laboratories & Astra Zeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Paratek, Rempex, Rib-X, Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, and Trius. If we are unable to compete successfully with these and other potential future competitors, we may be unable to grow and sustain revenues, if any.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nOur limited operating history makes evaluating our business and future prospects difficult and may increase the risk of any investment in our securities.\nWe were incorporated in Nevada in January 2013 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Oculus. We reincorporated in Delaware on September 25, 2013. We have a limited operating history on which to evaluate our business. We have incurred net losses since we began operations in October 2011. Through March 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $10,360,000. These losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with our research and development activities, pre-clinical tests and other regulatory activities, preparations for our initial public offering, other general and administrative costs associated with our operations, and carve-out financial information from Oculus prior to our incorporation on January 18, 2013. We face considerable risks and difficulties as a company with limited operating history. If we do not successfully address these risks, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely harmed.\nWe expect to incur significant additional operating losses over the next several years as we expand our research and development efforts, pre-clinical testing and clinical trials, and implement manufacturing, marketing and sales programs. In addition, as our development testing activities continue, our operating losses may increase. Further, this may result in negative cash flow in future periods as we fund operating losses and capital expenditures, and, therefore, will result in decreases in our working capital, total assets and stockholders\u2019 equity, which may not be offset by future financings. Our limited operating history makes it particularly difficult for us to predict our future operating results and appropriately budget for our expenses. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates or it adjusts our estimates in future periods, our operating results and financial position could be materially affected.\nMoreover, we do not have a product approved for commercial sale. We have limited experience as a newly formed research and development stage entity in the biopharmaceutical field, and our prospects must be considered in light of the fact that we have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology areas. These risks include, but are not limited to, unforeseen capital requirements, delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, failure to gain market acceptance and competition from foreseen and unforeseen sources. Accordingly, you should consider our prospects in light of the costs, uncertainties, delays and difficulties encountered by companies in the early stage of development.\nOur operating results for the foreseeable future will depend significantly on our ability to fund our research and development programs for, obtain regulatory approval of, and to successfully commercialize our drug candidates.\nRUT58-60 is currently our only drug candidate in a clinical trial. We may not receive revenues or royalties from commercial sales of RUT58-60 or any other drug in the foreseeable future, if at all.\nOur development of drug candidates involves a high degree of risk. Many important factors affect its ability to successfully develop and commercialize RUT58-60, and our other drug candidates including our ability to:\n\u2022 demonstrate safety and efficacy at each stage of the clinical trial process;\n\u2022 meet applicable regulatory standards and receive required regulatory approvals;\n\u2022 obtain and maintain necessary patents and/or licenses;\n\u2022 produce drugs in commercial quantities at reasonable costs;\n\u2022 obtain reimbursement coverage;\n\u2022 compete successfully against other products; and\n\u2022 market RUT58-60, or our other drug candidates, successfully.\nWe cannot assure you that we will successfully develop and commercialize RUT58-60, or our other drug candidates, or that we will obtain required regulatory approvals for our commercialization. As a result, we may never generate revenues from RUT58-60 sales or sales of our other drug candidates. To date, we have not generated any revenue from RUT58-60 or any other product and we do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue in the future. We may never be able to successfully develop or commercialize RUT58-60 or any other product. Even if we do commercialize RUT58-60 or other product candidates in the future, we may incur significant sales, marketing, manufacturing and other general and administrative expenses, as well as continued research and development expenses. As a result, we cannot predict when we will become profitable, if at all, and if we do, we may not remain profitable for any substantial period of time. If we fail to achieve profitability within the timeframe expected by investors, the market price of the common stock may decline, and, therefore, may negatively impact our ability to raise capital, invest in or expand our business, acquire additional products or licenses, commercialize our products, or continue our operations.\nWe will need additional funding to advance our clinical trial programs, launch and commercialize our lead drug candidate or any other product candidate.\nPharmaceutical product development, which includes research and development, pre-clinical and clinical studies and human clinical trials, is a time-consuming and expensive process that takes years to complete. We expect that our expenses will increase substantially if and when we advance RUT58-60 into future clinical trials, seek regulatory approval for RUT58-60 for the abdominal surgery indication, seek regulatory approval for RUT58-60 in additional surgical and traumatic injury indications, pursues development of additional innovative HOCl based pharmaceutical formulations and/or pursues development of HOCl based pharmaceuticals in additional indications. If we obtain marketing approval for RUT58-60 or any other product candidate that we develop, license, or acquire, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to pre-launch activities, regulatory compliance requirements, sales and marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Additionally, we may incur expenses directly related to license and product acquisitions.\nWe believe that our existing cash, which includes the proceeds from our initial public offering, will be sufficient to fund our current operations into the quarter ending June 30, 2016. These funds will not be sufficient to enable us to conduct future clinical trials, seek marketing approval for RUT58-60 or commercially launch RUT58-60, or any other drug candidate, in the United States or any other country or geographic area.\nOur inability to raise capital on acceptable terms in the future may cause us to delay, diminish, or curtail our operations, and such inability would have a material adverse effect on its business and financial condition.\nWe expect capital outlays and operating expenditures to increase over the next several years as we work to conduct clinical trials, establish independent manufacturing operations, commercialize our products and expand our infrastructure. We may need to raise additional capital to, among other things:\n\u2022 fund any planned clinical trials for our drug candidates;\n\u2022 sustain commercialization of any other product candidate;\n\u2022 develop our manufacturing capabilities;\n\u2022 increase our sales and marketing efforts;\n\u2022 acquire, license or in-license other product candidates;\n\u2022 finance capital expenditures and our general and administrative expenses;\n\u2022 develop new products;\n\u2022 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property;\n\u2022 add operational, financial and management information systems; and\n\u2022 hire additional clinical, quality control, scientific, and general and administrative personnel.\n\u2022 Our present and future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022 the progress and timing of our clinical trials;\n\u2022 the level of research and development investment required to maintain and improve our technology position;\n\u2022 the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022 our efforts to acquire or license complementary technologies or acquire complementary businesses;\n\u2022 changes in product development plans;\n\u2022 competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022 changes in regulatory policies or laws that may affect our operations; and\n\u2022 changes in physician acceptance or medical society recommendations that may affect commercial efforts.\nFailure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, financial performance, and share price and could require us to delay or abandon development or commercialization plans.\nMarket and economic conditions may negatively impact our business, financial condition and share price.\nConcerns over inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the U.S. mortgage market and a declining real estate market, unstable global credit markets and financial conditions, and volatile oil prices have led to periods of significant economic instability, diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence and discretionary spending, diminished expectations for the global economy and expectations of slower global economic growth going forward, increased unemployment rates, and increased credit defaults in recent years. Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by any such economic downturns, volatile business environments and continued unstable or unpredictable economic and market conditions. If these conditions continue to deteriorate or do not improve, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to complete, more costly, and more dilutive. In addition, there is a risk that one or more of our current and future service providers, manufacturers, suppliers, hospitals and other medical facilities, our third party payors, and other partners could be negatively affected by difficult economic times, which could adversely affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget or meet our business and financial objectives.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we and Oculus do not obtain protection for our respective intellectual property rights, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our research and development efforts to develop competing drugs.\nOur success, competitive position and future revenues will depend in part on our ability and the ability of Oculus, the licensor of intellectual property rights relating to RUT58-60, to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, methods, processes and other technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Under our license and supply agreement with Oculus, we hold certain exclusive patent rights for a specified field and territory, including licensed rights under U.S. patents and U.S. patent applications as well as licensed rights under foreign patents and patent applications owned by Oculus.\nWe may file additional patent applications both in the United States and in other countries, as appropriate. However, the patent process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting our products by obtaining and defending patents. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the following:\n\u2022 Patents may not be granted from patent applications submitted by us or our licensor, Oculus, to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or foreign patent applications.\n\u2022 Patents that have issued or will issue, where our own or in-licensed patents and patent applications from Oculus or another entity, may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage.\n\u2022 Countries other than the United States may have less restrictive patent laws than those upheld by United States courts, allowing foreign competitors the ability to exploit these laws to create, develop, and market competing products.\n\u2022 Our, many of which have substantially greater resources than us and many of which have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate its ability to make, use, and sell our potential products either in the United States or in international markets.\n\u2022 There may be significant pressure on the United States government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for treatments that prove successful as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns.\nIn addition, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and patent offices in other jurisdictions have often required that patent applications concerning pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application, thereby limiting the scope of protection against competitive challenges. Thus, even if we or Oculus are able to obtain patents, the patents may be substantially narrower than anticipated.\nIn addition to patents, we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how. Although we take measures to protect this information by entering into confidentiality and inventions agreements with our employees, scientific advisors, consultants, and collaborators, we cannot provide any assurances that these agreements will not be breached, that we will be able to protect ourselves from the harmful effects of disclosure if they are breached, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. If any of these events occurs, or we otherwise lose protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, the value of this information may be greatly reduced.\nPatent protection and other intellectual property protection are important to the success of our business and prospects, and there is a substantial risk that such protections will prove inadequate.\nOur intellectual property may not be sufficient to protect our products from competition and may negatively affect our business as well as limit our partnership or acquisition appeal.\nWe may be subject to competition despite the existence of intellectual property that we may license or own. We can give no assurances that our intellectual property protection will be sufficient to prevent third parties from designing around patents it owns or licenses and developing and commercializing competitive products. The existence of competitive products that avoid our intellectual property could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, limitations, or perceived limitations, in our intellectual property may limit the interest of third parties to partner, collaborate or otherwise transact with us, if third parties perceive a higher than acceptable risk to commercialization of our products or future products.\nWe may elect to sue a third party, or otherwise make a claim, alleging infringement or other violation of patents, trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, trade secrets, domain names or other intellectual property rights that we either owns or licenses. If we dos not prevail in enforcing its intellectual property rights in this type of litigation, we may be subject to:\n\u2022 paying monetary damages related to the legal expenses of the third party;\n\u2022 facing additional competition that may have a significant adverse effect on our product pricing, market share, business operations, financial condition, and the commercial viability of our products; and\n\u2022 restructuring our company or delaying or terminating select business opportunities, including, but not limited to, research and development, clinical trial, and commercialization activities, due to a potential deterioration of its financial condition or market competitiveness.\nA third party may also challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of the intellectual property rights that we license or own; and, the result of these challenges may narrow the scope or claims of or invalidate patents that are integral to RUT58-60 or other drug candidates in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully defend patents we own or license in an action against third parties due to the unpredictability of litigation and the high costs associated with intellectual property litigation, amongst other factors.\nIntellectual property rights and enforcement may be less extensive in jurisdictions outside of the United States; thus, we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and third parties may be able to market competitive products that may use some or all of our intellectual property.\nChanges to patent law may substantially change the regulations and procedures surrounding patent applications, issuance of patents, and prosecution of patents. We can give no assurances that its patents and those of any licensor can be defended or will protect us against future intellectual property challenges, particularly as they pertain to changes in patent law and future patent law interpretations.\nThe actual or purported intellectual property rights of third parties may negatively affect our business.\nA third party may sue us or our licensor or otherwise make a claim, alleging infringement or other violation of the third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. If we do not prevail in successfully defending this type of litigation, we may be required to:\n\u2022 pay monetary damages;\n\u2022 obtain a license in order to continue manufacturing or marketing the affected products, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all; or\n\u2022 stop commercial activities relating to the affected products, which could include a recall of the affected products and/or a cessation of sales.\nThe costs of defending an intellectual property claim could be substantial and could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, even if we successfully defend such claims. We cannot offer assurances that we will be able to defend ourselves against claims by third parties due to the high costs associated with intellectual property litigation, amongst other factors.\nIntellectual property rights in the field of surgical medicine frequently involve complex legal and factual questions. We are not guaranteed the right to practice our patented technology or develop, manufacture or commercialize its patented products even if we own or license patent rights relating to its products. We cannot be certain that a competitor or other third party does not have or will not obtain rights to intellectual property that may prevent it from manufacturing, developing or marketing certain of its products, regardless of whether we believe such intellectual property rights are valid and enforceable or we believe we would be otherwise able to develop a more commercially successful product, which may harm our operating results and financial condition.\nFurthermore, any intellectual property litigation could be perceived negatively by securities analysts or investors which could have a material adverse effect on the value of its securities.\nIf we materially breach or default under our license and supply agreement with Oculus, Oculus will have the right to terminate the agreement and we could lose critical license rights, which would materially harm our business.\nWe do not currently own any patents, trademarks, or copyrights; however, our business is substantially dependent upon certain intellectual property rights that we license from Oculus. Therefore, our commercial success will depend to a large extent on our ability to maintain and comply with our obligations under our license and supply agreement with Oculus. Our license and supply agreement with Oculus provides Oculus with the right to terminate the agreement for an uncured breach by us, or if we are insolvent or the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, or potentially other reasons. In addition, under the license and supply agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy certain development milestones and other obligations with regard to the development and commercialization of RUT58-60 in order for us to maintain the license. We expect that other technology in-licenses that we may enter into in the future will contain similar provisions and impose similar obligations on us. If we fail to comply with any such obligations to Oculus or future licensors, such licensor will likely terminate their out-licenses to us, in which case we would not be able to market products covered by these licenses, including the RUT58-60 technology. The loss of our license with Oculus with respect to the RUT58-60 technology, and potentially other licenses that we enter into in the future, would have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, our failure to comply with obligations under our material in-licenses may cause us to become subject to litigation or other potential disputes under any such license agreements.\nIn addition, our license and supply agreement with Oculus requires us to make certain payments, including license fees, milestone payments royalties, and other such terms typically required under licensing agreements and these types of technology in-licenses could make it less profitable for us to develop product candidates utilizing these existing product candidates and technologies.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, independent consultants or agencies have wrongfully used or inadvertently disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nWe employ individuals and contract with independent consultants and agencies that may have previously worked at or conducted business with third parties; and, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or agencies have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of our employees\u2019 former employers or other third parties. We may also be subject to claims that former employers or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. There is no guarantee of success in defending these claims, and if we are successful, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and other employees.\nRisks Related to its Relationship with Oculus\nApproval of commercial terms between us and Oculus does not preclude the possibility of stockholder litigation, including but not limited to derivative litigation nominally against Oculus and against its directors and officers and also against us and our directors and officers.\nThe commercial terms of the license and supply agreement, shared services agreement and separation agreement that we entered into with Oculus have been negotiated on behalf of Oculus by a Special Transaction Committee consisting solely of disinterested Oculus directors. We believe such negotiations have been at arms\u2019 length. We have no basis for believing that the terms of these agreements will not be in the best interests of both Oculus and its stockholders and also us and our stockholders. Nonetheless, no assurance can be given that any stockholder of Oculus will not claim in a lawsuit that such terms in fact are not in the best interests of Oculus and its stockholders, that the directors and officers of Oculus breached their fiduciary duties in connection with such agreements and that any disclosures by Oculus to its stockholders regarding these agreements and the relationship between Oculus and us did not satisfy applicable requirements. In any such instance, we and our directors and officers may also be named as defendants and we would have to defend ourselves and our directors and officers. While we will seek indemnification from Oculus under the terms of these agreements against any damages or other costs, which could be substantial, no such indemnification has yet been agreed to or may be agreed to and be in effect. Further, any such litigation would be time-consuming and would divert focus and resources from the development of our product candidates and our business.\nYour investment in our securities may be adversely affected due to Oculus\u2019 ownership of our common stock.\nThe liquidity of the market for our common stock may be constrained for as long as Oculus continues to hold a significant position in its common stock. As of June 5, 2015, Oculus holds approximately 34% of our outstanding common stock and approximately 42% of the voting power of our common stock. Additionally, without a distribution or other liquidity event of our shares of common stock held by Oculus, there will be limited liquidity in the market for our common stock, which will impact our stockholders and stock price. A lack of liquidity in the market for our common stock may adversely affect our stock price and therefore, our ability to raise additional funds in the public markets, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business.\nThe ownership by our executive officers and our directors of shares of Oculus common stock and rights to purchase Oculus common stock may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest.\nThe ownership by our executive officers and our directors of shares of Oculus common stock, options to purchase shares of Oculus common stock, or other equity awards of Oculus may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest. Our chief executive officer and chairman of the board served as the chief executive officer of Oculus until February 2013 and chairman of the board of Oculus until February 2014. Our chief financial officer since February 2013 has been granted options in Oculus. Two of our three directors formerly served on the board of directors of Oculus. Because of the current and former positions of our executive officers and our directors with Oculus, they own shares of Oculus common stock, options to purchase shares of Oculus common stock or other equity awards of Oculus. Ownership by our executive officers and directors of common stock or options to purchase common stock of Oculus, or any other equity awards, may create the appearance of conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for Oculus than the decisions have for us. Any perceived conflicts of interest resulting from investors questioning the independence of our management or the integrity of corporate governance procedures may materially affect our stock price.\nAny disputes that arise between us and Oculus with respect to our past and ongoing relationships could harm our business operations.\nDisputes may arise between us and Oculus in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships, including:\n\u2022 intellectual property, technology and business matters, including failure to make required technology transfers and failure to comply with non-compete provisions applicable to Oculus and us;\n\u2022 labor, tax, employee benefit, indemnification and other matters arising from our separation from Oculus;\n\u2022 distribution and supply obligations;\n\u2022 employee retention and recruiting;\n\u2022 business combinations involving us;\n\u2022 sales or distributions by Oculus of all or any portion of our ownership interest in us;\n\u2022 the nature, quality and pricing of services Oculus has agreed to provide us; and\n\u2022 business opportunities that may be attractive to both Oculus and us.\nWe are a party to a the separation agreement with Oculus related to the separation of our business operations from those of Oculus that contains certain limitations on Oculus\u2019 ability to control various aspects of our business and operations, notwithstanding Oculus\u2019 substantial ownership position in our common stock.\nWe and our stockholders may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our separation from Oculus.\nWe are focused on developing HOCl based drugs to prevent and treat infection in invasive applications. Drug development is an expensive and time-consuming process, but we believe the knowledge we have gained while operating as a subsidiary of Oculus has helped expedite this process. However, in order to realize the value proposition of us as a drug development company, we intend to target early stage healthcare and pharmaceutical focused investors, who are interested in investing in drug development companies and who appreciate the risks, rewards and typically longer investment timelines associated with such investments. In order to successfully attract this type of new investment, we believe it is critical that we separate from Oculus, because we believe that doing so will provide it with some or all of the following benefits:\n\u2022 improving strategic and operational flexibility, increasing management focus and streamlining decision-making by providing the flexibility to implement our strategic plan and to respond more effectively to different customer needs and the changing economic environment;\n\u2022 allowing us to adopt the capital structure, investment policy and dividend policy best suited to our financial profile and business needs, without competing for capital with Oculus\u2019 other businesses;\n\u2022 creating an independent equity structure that will facilitate our ability to affect future acquisitions utilizing our common stock; and\n\u2022 facilitating incentive compensation arrangements for employees more directly tied to the performance of our business, and enhancing employee hiring and retention by, among other things, improving the alignment of management and employee incentives with performance and growth objectives of our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe trading market in our common stock has been extremely limited.\nSince our initial listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market on March 21, 2014, the trading market in our common stock has been extremely limited. The quotation of our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market does not assure that a meaningful, consistent and liquid trading market currently exists. We cannot predict whether a more active market for our common stock will develop in the future. An absence of an active trading market could adversely affect our stockholders\u2019 ability to sell our common stock at current market prices in short time periods, or possibly at all. Additionally, market visibility for our common stock may be limited and such lack of visibility may have a depressive effect on the market price for our common stock. As of March 31, 2015, approximately 50% of our outstanding shares of common stock were controlled by our officers, directors, beneficial owners of 5% or more of our securities and their respective affiliates, which adversely affects the liquidity of the trading market for our common stock, in as much as federal securities laws restrict sales of our shares by these stockholders. If our affiliates continue to hold their shares of common stock, there will be limited trading volume in our common stock, which may make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares or increase the volatility of our stock price. In addition, as of March 31, 2015, 2,000,000 shares of common stock, or 42% of our outstanding shares, were restricted from resale under securities laws or as a result of lock-up agreements, further limiting the liquidity of our common stock.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate, as a result of, among other factors:\n\u2022 the sale of our common stock by Oculus, our former parent and largest stockholder at potentially significant discounts to the prevailing market price, subject to certain contractual conditions;\n\u2022 the sale of our common stock by our stockholders, executives, and directors;\n\u2022 the limitations in trading volumes of our shares of common stock;\n\u2022 our ability to obtain financing when needed to fund our operations;\n\u2022 our ability to secure resources and the necessary personnel to conduct clinical trials on our desired schedule;\n\u2022 commencement, enrollment or results of our clinical trials of RUT58-60 or any future clinical trials we may conduct;\n\u2022 changes in the development status of RUT58-60;\n\u2022 any delays or adverse developments or perceived adverse developments with respect to the FDA\u2019s review of our planned pre-clinical and clinical trials;\n\u2022 any delay in our submission for studies or product approvals or adverse regulatory decisions, including failure to receive regulatory approval for RUT58-60;\n\u2022 new products or services, enhancements, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments;\n\u2022 unanticipated safety concerns related to the use of RUT58-60;\n\u2022 failures to meet external expectations or management guidance;\n\u2022 changes in our capital structure or dividend policy, future issuances of securities, sales or distributions of large blocks of common stock by our stockholders, including Oculus;\n\u2022 our cash position;\n\u2022 announcements and events surrounding financing efforts;\n\u2022 our inability to enter into new markets or develop new products;\n\u2022 reputational issues;\n\u2022 competition from existing technologies and products or new technologies and products that may emerge;\n\u2022 announcements related to acquisitions, partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures, new products, capital commitments, or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 changes in general economic, political and market conditions in or any of the regions in which we conduct our business;\n\u2022 changes in industry conditions or perceptions;\n\u2022 changes in valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022 analyst research reports, recommendations and changes in recommendations, price targets, and withdrawals of coverage;\n\u2022 departures and additions of key personnel;\n\u2022 disputes and litigation related to intellectual property, proprietary rights, and contractual obligations;\n\u2022 changes in applicable laws;\n\u2022 announcements or actions taken by Oculus as our principal stockholder;\n\u2022 open-market transactions that may occur prior to or immediately after any distribution of shares by Oculus; and\n\u2022 other events or factors, many of which may be out of our control.\nIn addition, if the market for stocks in our industry or industries related to our industry, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could fluctuate or decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights.\nWe may seek the additional capital necessary to fund our operations through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, and collaborative and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, existing stockholders ownership interests will be diluted and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect their rights as a stockholder. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nDue to the speculative nature of warrants, there is no guarantee that it will ever be profitable for holders of the warrants to exercise the warrants.\nThe Series A warrants that we issued in our initial public offering do not confer any rights of common stock ownership on our holders, such as voting rights or the right to receive dividends, but rather merely represent the right to acquire shares of common stock at a formulaic price that is subject to adjustment for a limited period of time. The holders of our Series A warrants may exercise their right to acquire additional shares of our common stock and Series B warrants to purchase additional shares of our common stock. In order to do so, they must pay an exercise price of $7.25 per Series A warrant within the two years following the date of issuance, after which date any unexercised Series A warrants will expire and have no further value. There can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will equal or exceed the exercise price of the Series A warrants, and consequently, whether it will ever be profitable for holders of the Series A warrants to exercise the Series A warrants. This same analysis applies with equal effect to our Series B warrants that are issuable upon exercise of the Series A warrants, however the exercise of the Series B warrants is $9.0625 per share and the expiration date is five years following the date of issuance.\nThere is no public market for our warrants, and we do not expect one to develop.\nWe sold units in our initial public offering, each of which contained one share of common stock and one Series A warrant. The Series A warrants are exercisable for additional shares of common stock and Series B warrants. The Series B warrants are issuable for additional shares of common stock. There is no public trading market for our Series A warrants or our Series B warrants that are issuable upon exercise of the Series A warrants, and we do not expect a market to develop. In addition, we do not intend to apply for listing of the warrants on any securities exchange. Without an active market, the liquidity of our warrants will be limited.\nThe exercise of outstanding options and warrants to acquire shares of our common stock will cause additional dilution, which could cause the price of our common stock to fall.\nIn our initial public offering, we issued an aggregate of 3,047,500 Series A warrants, all of which are outstanding as of March 31, 2015. Each of our Series A warrants is exercisable for one share of common stock and one Series B Warrant to purchase one share of common stock. Accordingly, we have reserved 6,095,000 shares of our common stock for issuance upon exercise of our Series A warrants and Series B warrants. If the holders of our Series A warrants exercise their warrants, you will experience dilution at the time they exercise their Series A warrants. Similarly, if those who exercised their Series A warrants also exercise the Series B warrants they receive upon exercise of the Series A warrants, you will experience further dilution at the time they exercise their Series B warrants. The Series A warrants and Series B warrants contains price adjustment provisions, which may cause the exercise prices to be reduced relative to the initial exercise prices of 100% and 125% of the initial public offering price per unit, respectively, if we complete future equity sales at discounts to the then-market price and below the initial exercise price of the warrants.\nIn addition, as of April 1, 2015, we have reserved 1,230,855 shares of our common stock under our 2013 Employee, Director and Consultant Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2013 Plan\u201d), and a majority of these shares are subject to outstanding stock options and restricted stock units. Furthermore, we may issue additional options, warrants and other types of equity in the future as part of stock-based compensation, capital raising transactions, technology licenses, financings, strategic licenses or other strategic transactions. To the extent these options are exercised, existing stockholders would experience additional dilution. In addition, subject to the approval of the Company\u2019s stockholders, the pool of available stock available for grant under our 2013 Plan will increase at the beginning of each fiscal year by the lower of: (i) 2,551,500 shares; (ii) 5% of the number of shares of outstanding common stock; and (iii) an amount determined by our board of directors.\nOn March 12, 2015, in connection with the Merger Agreement, our compensation committee and board of directors unanimously approved the Ruthigen, Inc. Amended and Restated 2013 Employee, Director and Consultant Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201cNew 2013 Plan\u201d), subject to the approval of our stockholders. The New 2013 Plan will allow for the issuance of up to 6,853,319 shares of our common stock, up from 1,230,855 shares, pursuant to awards to be granted under the New 2013 Plan.\n\u201cPenny stock\u201d rules may make buying or selling our securities difficult which may make our stock less liquid and make it harder for investors to buy and sell our securities.\nIf our shares of common stock are delisted by NASDAQ and begin to trade on an over-the-counter market such as the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board or any quotation system maintained by OTC Markets, Inc., trading in our securities will be subject to the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules and it is anticipated that trading in our securities will continue to be subject to the penny stock rules for the foreseeable future. The SEC has adopted regulations that generally define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. These rules require that any broker-dealer who recommends our securities to persons other than prior customers and accredited investors must, prior to the sale, make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to execute the transaction. Unless an exception is available, the regulations require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with trading in the penny stock market. In addition, broker-dealers must disclose commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities they offer. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by these requirements may discourage broker-dealers from recommending transactions in our securities, which could severely limit the liquidity of our securities and consequently adversely affect the market price for our securities.\nFinancial reporting obligations of being a public company in the United States are expensive and time-consuming, and our management may be required to devote substantial time to compliance matters.\nAs a publicly traded company, we incur significant additional legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a privately held, wholly owned subsidiary of Oculus. The obligations of being a public reporting company require significant expenditures, including costs resulting from public company reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations regarding corporate governance practices, including those under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, and the listing requirements of the stock exchange on which our securities are listed. These rules require the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and procedures, internal control over financial reporting and changes in corporate governance practices, among many other complex rules that are often difficult to implement, monitor and maintain compliance with. Moreover, despite recent reforms made possible by the JOBS Act, the reporting requirements, rules, and regulations will make some activities more time-consuming and costly, particularly after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d In addition, these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. Compliance with such requirements also places demands on management\u2019s time and attention.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our shares of common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our shares.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the increase, if any, of our share price.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and our election to delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies may result in our financial statements not being comparable to those of other public companies. As a result of this and other reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our securities may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\nIn other words, an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are electing to delay such adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result of such election, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of other public companies. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We could remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earliest to occur of earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which it has total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more; (ii) March 31, 2019; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC.\nWe may be at risk of securities class action litigation.\nWe may be at risk of securities class action litigation. This risk is especially relevant due to our dependence on positive clinical trial outcomes and regulatory approvals of RUT58-60. In the past, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility, particularly when associated with binary events such as clinical trials and product approvals. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business and results in a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nIf we fail to comply with listing requirements, NASDAQ may delist our common stock from our exchange, which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our common stock and subject it to additional trading restrictions.\nIf we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d), such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, the NASDAQ may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair our ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we would take actions to restore our compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the NASDAQ minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s listing requirements.\nIf the NASDAQ Capital Market does not maintain the listing of our securities for trading on our exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022 a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u2022 reduced liquidity with respect to our securities;\n\u2022 a determination that our shares of common stock are \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which will require brokers trading in our shares of common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares of common stock;\n\u2022 a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u2022 decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nRisks Related to the Proposed Merger\nThe issuance of our shares of common stock to Pulmatrix stockholders in the Merger will substantially dilute the voting power of current stockholders. Having a minority share position may reduce the influence that current stockholders have on our management.\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, we will issue approximately 27,848,269 shares of our common stock to Pulmatrix equity holders as merger consideration, and immediately following the Merger, we will issue 1,636,364 shares of common stock upon conversion of Pulmatrix bridge loans. Upon completion of the Merger, current stockholders will hold 5,653,618 shares, or approximately 16.1% of the issued and outstanding equity and former Pulmatrix stockholders will own 29,484,633 shares or approximately 83.9% of our issued and outstanding equity, in each case, excluding options and restricted stock units. Accordingly, the issuance of shares of our common stock to Pulmatrix equity holders in the Merger will significantly reduce the ownership stake and relative voting power of each share of common stock held by current stockholders. Consequently, following the Merger, the ability of our current stockholders to influence the management of Ruthigen will be substantially reduced.\nThere is no assurance when or if the Merger will be completed. Any delay in completing the Merger may substantially reduce the benefits that we expect to obtain from the Merger.\nCompletion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions as set forth in the Merger Agreement. There can be no assurance that we and Pulmatrix will be able to satisfy the closing conditions or that closing conditions beyond their control will be satisfied or waived. If the Merger and the integration of the companies\u2019 respective businesses are not completed within the expected timeframe, such delay may materially and adversely affect the synergies and other benefits that we and Pulmatrix expect to achieve as a result of the Merger and could result in additional transaction costs, loss of revenue or other effects associated with uncertainty about the Merger.\nBecause the lack of a public market for Pulmatrix\u2019s outstanding shares makes it difficult to evaluate the fairness of the Merger, Pulmatrix stockholders may receive consideration in the Merger that is greater than or less than the fair market value of the Pulmatrix shares.\nThe outstanding capital stock of Pulmatrix is privately held and is not traded in any public market. The lack of a public market makes it extremely difficult to determine the fair market value of Pulmatrix shares. Since the percentage of our common stock to be issued to Pulmatrix equity holders was determined based on negotiations between the parties, it is possible that the value of our common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger will be greater than the fair market value of Pulmatrix shares. Alternatively, it is possible that the value of our shares common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger will be less than the fair market value of Pulmatrix shares.\nOur directors and officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders generally that may influence them to support or approve the Merger.\nOur officers and directors may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or are in addition to, those of our stockholders. Effective upon the closing of the Merger, Messrs. Alimi and Harish will be employed by the combined company and receive compensation and other consideration These interests may have influenced our directors and executive officers of Ruthigen and Pulmatrix to support or recommend the proposals presented to our stockholders.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Merger could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or business prospects.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Merger could disrupt our business in the following ways, among others:\n\u2022 our employees may experience uncertainty regarding their future roles in the combined company, which might adversely affect our ability to retain, recruit and motivate key personnel;\n\u2022 the attention of our management may be directed towards the completion of the Merger and other transaction-related considerations and may be diverted from the day-to-day business operations and matters related to the Merger may require commitments of time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that might have been beneficial to us; and\n\u2022 suppliers and other third parties with business relationships with us may decide not to renew or may decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us as a result of the Merger, whether pursuant to the terms of their existing agreements with us or otherwise.\nShould they occur, any of these matters could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or business prospects.\nCovenants in the Merger Agreement place certain restrictions on our conduct of business prior to the closing of the Merger, including entering into a business combination with another party.\nThe Merger Agreement restricts us from taking certain specified actions with respect to the conduct of our business without Pulmatrix\u2019s consent, including prohibition on soliciting, initiating, encouraging discussions or negotiations with or providing non-public information to any person concerning a merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities or other capital structure alternatives and making other changes to our business or executing certain of its business strategies prior to the completion of the Merger, which could be favorable to our stockholders.\nThe issuance of our common stock in connection with the Merger could decrease the market price of our common stock.\nIn connection with the Merger and as part of the merger consideration, we will issue shares of common stock to Pulmatrix equity holders. The issuance of our common stock in the Merger may result in fluctuations in the market price of our common stock, including a stock price decrease.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses related to the Merger and the integration of Pulmatrix.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with the Merger and integration of Pulmatrix. We may incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key employees and will incur significant fees and expenses relating to legal, accounting, financial advisory and other transaction fees and costs associated with the Merger. Specifically, based on estimates as of March 31, 2015, we expect to incur approximately $3.6 million of transaction costs related to the Merger, including $2.4 million payable in cash and $1.2 million payable in stock. Additionally, there are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated, including purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, billing, payroll, manufacturing, marketing and employee benefits, and we may incur after-tax integration and restructuring costs and other costs incurred to execute the transaction following completion of the Merger.\nRisks Related to the Combined Company Following the Merger\nAlthough we expect that the Merger will result in benefits to the combined company, the combined company may not realize those benefits because of various challenges.\nWe may not be able to fully realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger. The integration of a new company is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. This process may disrupt the business of either or both of the companies, and may not result in the full benefits expected by us. Delays in the integration process could adversely affect the combined company\u2019s business, financial results, financial condition, and stock price following the Merger. There can be no assurance that the combination will result in the realization of the anticipated benefits from the Merger.\nThe market price of the combined company\u2019s common stock after the Merger may be subject to significant fluctuations and volatility, and stockholders may be unable to resell their shares at a profit and incur losses.\nThere has not been a public market for the combined company\u2019s common stock. The market price of the combined company\u2019s common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation following the Merger. Our business differs from that of Pulmatrix in important respects and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company and the market price of the combined company common stock following the Merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations of our company. Market prices for securities of early-stage pharmaceutical, medical device, biotechnology and other life science companies have historically been particularly volatile. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of the combined company\u2019s common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022 the announcement of new products, new developments, services or technological innovations by the combined company or the combined company\u2019s competitors;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated quarterly increases or decreases in revenue, gross margin or earnings, and changes in the combined company\u2019s business, operations or prospects;\n\u2022 announcements relating to strategic relationships, mergers, acquisitions, partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures, capital commitments, or other events by the combined company or the combined company\u2019s competitors;\n\u2022 conditions or trends in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries;\n\u2022 changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies;\n\u2022 general market conditions or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to the combined company\u2019s performance or financial condition;\n\u2022 sale of the combined company\u2019s common stock by stockholders, including executives and directors;\n\u2022 volatility and limitations in trading volumes of the combined company\u2019s common stock;\n\u2022 the combined company\u2019s ability to obtain financings to conduct and complete research and development activities including, but not limited to, its human clinical trials, and other business activities;\n\u2022 ability to secure resources and the necessary personnel to conduct clinical trials on the combined company\u2019s desired schedule;\n\u2022 failures to meet external expectations or management guidance;\n\u2022 changes in the combined company\u2019s capital structure or dividend policy, future issuances of securities, sales or distributions of large blocks of common stock by stockholders;\n\u2022 the combined company\u2019s cash position;\n\u2022 announcements and events surrounding financing efforts, including debt and equity securities;\n\u2022 analyst research reports, recommendation and changes in recommendations, price targets, and withdrawals of coverage;\n\u2022 departures and additions of key personnel;\n\u2022 disputes and litigations related to intellectual properties, proprietary rights, and contractual obligations;\n\u2022 changes in applicable laws, rules, regulations, or accounting practices and other dynamics; and\n\u2022 other events or factors, many of which may be out of the combined company\u2019s control.\nIf the Merger is consummated, our business operations, strategies and focus will fundamentally change, and these changes may not result in an improvement in the value of our common stock.\nPending the consummation of the Merger, the Merger Agreement permits us to scale down our operations as we deem necessary and requires us to scale back patient enrollment in our clinical trial of RUT58-60, our primary drug candidate, and it is currently anticipated that the combined company would focus its resources on the development of products within the scope of Pulmatrix\u2019s current business plan. As a result, following the Merger, the combined company may seek to sell or assign its rights related to our current drug candidates, including RUT58-60. If completed, any such sale or assignment may be at a substantial discount, the consideration received may not accurately represent the value of the assets sold or assigned and our stockholders may not participate in the future prospects of such drug candidates.\nFollowing the Merger, it is expected that the combined company\u2019s primary products will be PUR1900, Pulmatrix\u2019s lead anti-infective product candidate, PUR0200, Pulmatrix\u2019s bronchodilator therapy candidate and Pulmatrix\u2019s other iSPERSE-based product candidates. Consequently, if the Merger is consummated, an investment in Ruthigen\u2019s common stock will primarily represent an investment in the business operations, strategies and focus of Pulmatrix. All of Pulmatrix\u2019s product candidates are still under development and may never be approved for sale or successfully commercialized. The failure to successfully commercialize one or more of Pulmatrix\u2019s current product candidates will significantly diminish the anticipated benefits of the Merger and have a material adverse effect on the business of the combined company. We cannot assure you that Ruthigen\u2019s business operations, strategies or focus will be successful following the Merger, and the Merger could depress the value of Ruthigen\u2019s common stock.\nWe may issue additional equity securities in the future, which may result in dilution to existing investors.\nTo the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, including in a debt financing where we issue convertible notes or notes with warrants our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may, from time to time, sell additional equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine. If we sell additional equity securities, existing stockholders may be materially diluted. In addition, new investors could gain rights superior to existing stockholders, such as liquidation and other preferences. In addition, the number of shares available for future grant under our equity compensation plans may be increased in the future. In addition, the exercise or conversion of outstanding options or warrants to purchase shares of capital stock may result in dilution to our stockholders upon any such exercise or conversion.\nAll of our outstanding shares of common stock are, and any shares of common stock that are issued in the Merger will be, freely tradable without restrictions or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) except for the restricted stock units that will be issued to certain employees and consultants, shares of common stock issued to certain advisors, and any shares held by affiliates, as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\nThe concentration of the capital stock ownership with insiders of the combined company after the Merger will likely limit the ability of the stockholders of the combined company to influence corporate matters.\nFollowing the Merger, the executive officers, directors, 5% percent or greater stockholders, and their respective affiliated entities of the combined company will in the aggregate beneficially own approximately 57% of the combined company\u2019s outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, have control over matters that require approval by the combined company\u2019s stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. Corporate actions might be taken even if other stockholders oppose them. This concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a corporate transaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial.\nIn the event that the combined company fails to satisfy any of the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market, its common stock may be delisted, which could affect its market price and liquidity.\nFollowing the Merger, the combined company\u2019s common stock is expected to be listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market. For continued listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market, the combined company will be required to comply with the continued listing requirements, including the minimum market capitalization standard, the corporate governance requirements and the minimum closing bid price requirement, among other requirements. In the event that the combined company fails to satisfy any of the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market, its common stock may be delisted. If the combined company is unable to list on The NASDAQ Stock Market, it would likely be more difficult to trade in or obtain accurate quotations as to the market price of the combined company\u2019s common stock. If the combined company\u2019s securities are delisted from trading on The NASDAQ Stock Market, and the combined company is not able to list its securities on another exchange or to have them quoted on NASDAQ, the combined company\u2019s securities could be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or on the \u201cpink sheets.\u201d As a result, the combined company could face significant adverse consequences including:\n\u2022 a limited availability of market quotations for its securities;\n\u2022 a determination that its common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in its common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for its securities;", "PERMNO": 14551, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "PULM"}
