{"cik": "1023291", "company": "Energy Future Holdings Corp /TX/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nImportant factors, in addition to others specifically addressed in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, that could have a material impact on our operations, liquidity, financial results and financial condition, or could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ materially from any projected outcome contained in any forward-looking statement in this report, are described below. There may be further risks and uncertainties that are not currently known or that are not currently believed to be material that may adversely affect our business, results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition in the future.\nOur major risks fall primarily into the following categories:\n\u2022\nRisks Related to the Chapter 11 Cases. The Chapter 11 Cases subject us to material expense and a variety of material and adverse impacts on our business, including: a decrease in the number of counterparties that are willing to engage in commodity related hedging transactions with us and a significant increase in the amount of collateral required to engage in any such transactions; a loss of, or a disruption in, the materials and services received from suppliers, contractors and service providers; a loss of wholesale and retail electric customers; difficulties in the retention of employees; management distraction; limitations on our ability to operate our business and to adjust to changing market and industry conditions during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases; and litigation and/or claims asserted by creditors and other stakeholders in the Chapter 11 Cases. Since the inception of the Chapter 11 Cases we have incurred fees associated with legal representation, financial advisory and other professional services, along with financing fees in excess of $880 million. Although the Bankruptcy Court has confirmed our Plan of Reorganization, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the plan are subject to a number of conditions (some of which are out of our control). Accordingly, there is no assurance that such transactions will be consummated or that the Plan of Reorganization will become effective. If those transactions are not consummated and the Plan of Reorganization does not become effective, we will be subject to a more lengthy and costly bankruptcy proceeding.\nRisks Related to Our Structure. The distributions that may be paid to us by Oncor are limited due to certain structural and operational ring-fencing measures. Further, distributions declared by Oncor are made by Oncor's independent board of directors subject to the terms of its organizational documents and applicable law.\n\u2022\nMarket, Financial and Economic Risks. Wholesale electricity prices in the ERCOT market have generally moved with the price of natural gas. Accordingly, our earnings, cash flows and the value of our lignite/coal and nuclear fueled generation assets are dependent in significant part upon the price of natural gas. In recent years natural gas supply has outpaced demand, thereby depressing natural gas prices. In addition, wholesale electricity prices move with ERCOT market heat rates, which could fall if demand for electricity were to decrease or if more efficient generation facilities are built in ERCOT. Accordingly, our earnings, cash flows and the value of our lignite/coal and nuclear fueled generation assets are also dependent in significant part upon market heat rates. Our assets or positions cannot be fully hedged against changes in commodity prices and market heat rates, and hedging transactions may not work as planned or hedge counterparties may default on their obligations. In addition, changes in technology or increased electricity conservation efforts may reduce the value of our assets.\n\u2022\nRegulatory and Legislative Risks. Our regulatory and legislative risks include changes in laws and regulations that govern our operations. In particular, new requirements for control of certain emissions from sources including electricity generation facilities may result in our incurrence of significant additional costs or significant changes to our existing operating practices. In addition, the rates of Oncor's electricity delivery business are subject to regulatory review, and may be reduced below current levels, which could adversely impact Oncor's results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\n\u2022\nOperational Risks. Our operational risks include the risks inherent in running electricity generation facilities, retail electricity operations and electricity transmission and distribution systems. Failure of our equipment and facilities, information technology failure, fuel or water supply interruptions and adverse weather conditions, among other things, can adversely affect our business. In addition, our retail business is subject to intense competition.\nRisks Related to Chapter 11 Cases\nWe have filed voluntary petitions for relief under the Bankruptcy Code and are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy cases.\nWe have filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. For the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, our business and operations will be subject to various risks, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nWhether the conditions (including the receipt of required regulatory approvals) to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Plan of Reorganization will be satisfied or waived;\n\u2022\nIncreased costs related to the Chapter 11 Cases and related litigation;\n\u2022\nNegative effects and increased costs of a prolonged duration of the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022\nOur ability to maintain or obtain sufficient financing sources for our operations during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases or to obtain sufficient exit financing to fund a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization;\n\u2022\nRisks related to our mining reclamation bonding obligations;\n\u2022\nPotential incremental increase in risks related to distributions from Oncor to EFH Corp. or EFIH;\n\u2022\nPotential increased difficulty in retaining and motivating our key employees through the process of reorganization, and potential increased difficulty in attracting new employees, and\n\u2022\nSignificant time and effort required to be spent by our senior management in dealing with the bankruptcy and restructuring activities rather than focusing exclusively on business operations.\nWe are also subject to risks and uncertainties with respect to the actions and decisions of creditors, regulators and other third parties who have interests in our Chapter 11 Cases that may be inconsistent with our plans. These risks and uncertainties could affect our business and operations in various ways and may significantly increase the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with Chapter 11 Cases, we cannot predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 Cases may have on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Plan of Reorganization may not become effective.\nWhile the Plan of Reorganization has been confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, it may not become effective because it is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent (some of which are beyond our control). There can be no assurance that such conditions will be satisfied, and therefore, that the Plan of Reorganization will become effective and that the Debtors will emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases as contemplated by such Plan of Reorganization. If the transactions contemplated by the Plan of Reorganization are not completed, it may become necessary to amend the Plan of Reorganization. The terms of any such amendment are uncertain and could result in material additional expense and result in material delays in the Chapter 11 Cases. We no longer have the exclusive right to propose a plan of reorganization in the Chapter 11 Cases. Accordingly, any creditor of the Debtors could propose a plan of reorganization with respect to any one or more of the Debtors. Any new plan of reorganization would require the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and the approval of the required creditors, which could subject us to more lengthy and costly Chapter 11 Cases. In addition, any resulting delay could require us to extend or refinance our DIP Facilities and could adversely impact our liquidity.\nThe consummation of the EFH Acquisition contemplated by the Plan of Reorganization is subject to various conditions precedent. If the Merger and Purchase Agreement is terminated, the Purchasers and the Investor Group will effectively have no liability to the Debtors thereunder except for certain expense reimbursement obligations. As a result, there is no certainty that the EFH Acquisition will be completed.\nThe Merger and Purchase Agreement includes various conditions precedent to consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby. The Purchasers' conditions precedent include, among other things, a condition that certain approvals and rulings be obtained, including from, among others, the PUCT and the IRS, that are necessary to consummate the acquisition and convert a successor to Reorganized EFH into a REIT. In addition, the Merger and Purchase Agreement may be terminated upon certain events, including, among other things, by either party, if certain termination events occur under the Plan Support Agreement, including if the EFH Acquisition is not completed by April 30, 2016, subject to extension to June 30, 2016 or August 31, 2016 under certain conditions. If the Merger and Purchase Agreement is terminated for any reason (including, among other things, due to failure to complete the EFH Acquisition within the timeframes described therein), the Purchasers and the Investor Group will effectively have no liability to the Debtors thereunder. EFH Corp. and EFIH have effectively waived their respective rights under the Merger and Purchase Agreement to seek any legal or equitable remedies (including money damages and specific performance) against the Purchasers or the Investor Group. As a result, even if the applicable regulatory approvals are obtained, there is no certainty that the EFH Acquisition will be completed. If it is not completed for any reason, the Debtors will have no recourse against the Purchasers and the Investor Group except for certain expense reimbursement obligations.\nOperating under Chapter 11 may restrict our ability to pursue our strategic and operational initiatives. Moreover, we are subject to various covenants and events of default under our DIP Facilities.\nUnder Chapter 11, transactions outside the ordinary course of business are subject to the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court, which may limit our ability to respond in a timely manner to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities or to adapt to changing market or industry conditions. The TCEH Debtors and the EFIH Debtors are subject to various covenants and events of default under their respective DIP Facilities. In general, certain of these covenants limit the Debtors' ability, subject to certain exceptions, to take certain actions, including:\n\u2022\nselling assets outside the normal course of business;\n\u2022\nconsolidating, merging, selling or otherwise disposing of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\ngranting liens, and\n\u2022\nfinancing our operations, investments or other capital needs or engaging in other business activities that may be in our best interest.\nIf the TCEH Debtors and EFIH Debtors fail to comply with these covenants or an event of default occurs under the DIP Facilities, our liquidity, financial condition or operations may be materially impacted.\nWe may experience increased levels of employee attrition as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, we may experience increased levels of employee attrition, and our employees likely will face considerable distraction and uncertainty. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our ability to engage, motivate and retain key employees or take other measures intended to motivate and incent key employees to remain with us through the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is limited by restrictions on implementation of incentive programs under the Bankruptcy Code. The loss of services of members of our senior management team could impair our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives, which would be likely to have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, our historical financial information will not be indicative of our future financial performance.\nOn the effective date of the Plan of Reorganization, we will cease to hold a direct or indirect interest in assets or liabilities of TCEH or any of TCEH's direct or indirect subsidiaries, and our capital structure will be significantly altered. Under fresh-start accounting rules that will apply to us upon the effective date of the Plan of Reorganization, our assets and liabilities will be adjusted to fair value, which could have a significant impact on our financial statements. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations following our emergence from Chapter 11 will not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements. In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases and the development of a Chapter 11 plan, it is also possible that additional restructuring and related charges may be identified and recorded in future periods. Such charges could be material to our consolidated financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nThere is no assurance regarding the outcome of various appeals related to whether note holders are entitled to certain make-whole or redemption premiums and/or post-petition interest in connection with the treatment of their claims in bankruptcy.\nThe EFIH Debtors are engaged in litigation regarding whether holders of its outstanding notes are entitled to receive a make-whole or redemption premium in connection with the repayment of such notes, including pursuant to a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization. As of December 31, 2015, the total aggregate amount of make-whole or redemption premiums that would be owed if such alleged claims were allowed claims would be approximately $946 million (of which $432 million relates to the EFIH First Lien Notes, $401 million relates to the EFIH Second Lien Notes and $113 million relates to the EFIH PIK Notes). The EFIH Debtors have received orders from the Bankruptcy Court disallowing such claims, but these orders are subject to, and are in the process of, being appealed by holders of such claims. See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion regarding these claims.\nEFH Corp. may become engaged in litigation or similar adversarial proceedings regarding whether holders of its outstanding notes are entitled to receive a make-whole or redemption premium in connection with the repayment of such notes if the Plan of Reorganization does not become effective. As of December 31, 2015, the total aggregate amount of make-whole or redemption premiums that would be owed if such alleged claims were allowed would be approximately $208 million.\nMoreover, creditors have made and may continue to make additional claims in the Chapter 11 Cases in connection with the repayments or settlements of their pre-petition debt such as indemnification claims or for the payment of fees and expenses incurred in connection with litigating such claims.\nIn addition, creditors have asserted and may continue to assert claims for post-petition interest, including default interest, on their outstanding notes in connection with the repayment of such notes, including pursuant to a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization. Such amounts would be material, particularly if such post-petition interest were required to be paid at the contract rate as opposed to the federal judgment rate.\nWe cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any of these matters.\nThe DIP Facilities may be insufficient to fund our cash requirements through our emergence from bankruptcy. In addition, our independent auditor's report on our financial statements raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern given the Chapter 11 Cases.\nFor the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, we will be subject to various risks, including but not limited to (i) the inability to maintain or obtain sufficient financing sources for operations or to fund the Plan of Reorganization and meet future obligations, and (ii) increased legal and other professional costs associated with the Chapter 11 Cases and our reorganization.\nIf the transactions contemplated by the Plan of Reorganization are not completed and the effective date of the Plan of Reorganization does not occur prior to the maturity of the DIP Facilities, we will likely need to refinance our existing DIP Facilities. We may not be able to obtain some or all of any such financing on acceptable terms or at all.\nIn its report on our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our independent public accounting firm states that the uncertainties inherent in the bankruptcy process raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe may not be able to obtain exit financing to repay the DIP Facilities or, if we are able to obtain such exit financing, the agreements governing such exit financing may significantly restrict our financing and operations flexibility after emerging from bankruptcy.\nIt is expected that the DIP Facilities will be repaid using, in whole or in part, the proceeds from borrowings under exit financings. Our ability to obtain such exit financings will depend on, among other things, the timing and outcome of various ongoing matters in the Chapter 11 Cases, our business, operations and financial condition, and market conditions. We have not yet received any commitment with respect to any exit facilities, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such exit facilities on reasonable economic terms, or at all. If we cannot secure exit financing, we may not be able to emerge from bankruptcy and may not be able to repay the DIP Facilities at their respective maturities. Any exit financing that we are able to secure may include a number of significant restrictive covenants which could impair our financing and operational flexibility and make it difficult for us to react to market conditions and satisfy our ongoing capital needs and unanticipated cash requirements. In addition, such exit facilities may require us to periodically meet various financial ratios and tests. These financial covenants and tests could limit our ability to react to market conditions or satisfy extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise restrict our financing and operations.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, net operating losses and other tax attributes are not expected to be available upon emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases.\nCertain tax attributes, such as net operating loss carry-forwards and certain tax credits, are expected to be utilized in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases. Under the Internal Revenue Code, tax attributes are reduced to the extent discharge of indebtedness income is excluded from gross income arising from a Chapter 11 case. If any attributes are still available after the application of Section 108, such attributes may be limited or lost in the event EFH Corp. or any of its subsidiaries experience an ownership change as defined under the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, tax attributes may be utilized in a transaction such as a sale or transfer of assets that could result in a significant tax liability for EFH Corp. and its subsidiaries. As a result of the foregoing rules, any pre-emergence net operating losses and certain tax credits are not expected to be available to EFH Corp. and its subsidiaries to reduce taxable income for tax periods beginning after emergence from Chapter 11.\nRisks Related to Our Structure\nEFH Corp. and EFIH have a very limited ability to control activities at Oncor due to structural and operational ring-fencing measures.\nEFH Corp. and EFIH depend upon Oncor for a significant amount of their cash flows and rely on such cash flows in order to satisfy their obligations. However, EFH Corp. and EFIH have a very limited ability to control the activities of Oncor. As part of the ring-fencing measures implemented by EFH Corp. and Oncor, including certain measures required by the PUCT's Order on Rehearing in Docket No. 34077, a majority of the members of Oncor's board of directors are required to meet the New York Stock Exchange requirements for independence in all material respects, and the unanimous, or majority, consent of such directors is required for Oncor to take certain actions. In addition, any new independent directors are required to be appointed by the nominating committee of Oncor Holdings' board of directors, a majority of whose members are independent directors. No member of EFH Corp.'s or EFIH's management is a member of Oncor's board of directors. Under Oncor Holdings' and Oncor's organizational documents, EFH Corp. has limited indirect consent rights with respect to the activities of Oncor, including (i) new issuances of equity securities by Oncor, (ii) material transactions with third parties involving Oncor outside of the ordinary course of business, (iii) actions that cause Oncor's assets to be subject to an increased level of jurisdiction of the FERC, (iv) any changes to the state of formation of Oncor, (v) material changes to accounting methods not required by US GAAP, and (vi) actions that fail to enforce certain tax sharing obligations between Oncor and EFH Corp. In addition, Oncor's organizational agreements contain restrictions on Oncor's ability to make distributions to its members, including indirectly to EFH Corp. or EFIH.\nAdditionally, the restrictive measures required by the PUCT's Order on Rehearing in Docket No. 34077, include, among other things:\n\u2022\nOncor not being restricted from incurring its own debt;\n\u2022\nOncor not guaranteeing or pledging any of its assets to secure the debt of any member of the Texas Holdings Group, and\n\u2022\nrestrictions on distributions by Oncor, and the right of the independent members of Oncor's board of directors and the largest non-majority member of Oncor to block the payment of distributions to Oncor Holdings (i.e., such distributions not being available to EFH Corp. under certain circumstances).\nOncor may or may not make any distributions to EFH Corp. or EFIH.\nEFH Corp. and Oncor have implemented certain structural and operational ring-fencing measures, including certain measures required by the PUCT's Order on Rehearing in Docket No. 34077, that were based on principles articulated by rating agencies and commitments made by Texas Holdings and Oncor to the PUCT and the FERC to further enhance Oncor's credit quality. These measures were put in place to mitigate Oncor's credit exposure to the Texas Holdings Group and to reduce the risk that the assets and liabilities of Oncor would be substantively consolidated with the assets and liabilities of the Texas Holdings Group in a bankruptcy of one or more of those entities.\nAs part of the ring-fencing measures, a majority of the members of the board of directors of Oncor are required to be, and are, independent from EFH Corp. and EFIH. Any new independent directors of Oncor are required to be appointed by the nominating committee of Oncor Holdings, which is required to be, and is, comprised of a majority of directors that are independent from EFH Corp. and EFIH. The organizational documents of Oncor give these independent directors, acting by majority vote, and, during certain periods, any director designated by Texas Transmission, the express right to prevent distributions from Oncor if they determine that it is in the best interests of Oncor to retain such amounts to meet expected future requirements. The Chapter 11 Cases could result in Oncor limiting or suspending such dividends to EFIH during the pendency of such filing. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that Oncor will make any distributions to EFH Corp. or EFIH.\nIn addition, Oncor's organizational documents prohibit Oncor from making any distribution to its owners, including EFH Corp. and EFIH, so long as and to the extent that such distribution would cause Oncor's regulatory capital structure to exceed the debt-to-equity ratio established by the PUCT for ratemaking purposes, which is currently set at 60% debt to 40% equity. Under the terms of a Federal and State Income Tax Allocation Agreement, Oncor makes tax payments to EFH Corp. (bypassing EFIH) based on its share of an amount calculated to approximate the amount of taxes Oncor would have paid to the IRS if it was a stand-alone taxpayer.\nMarket, Financial and Economic Risks\nTCEH's revenues and results of operations generally are negatively impacted by decreases in market prices for electricity, natural gas prices and/or market heat rates.\nTCEH is not guaranteed any rate of return on capital investments in its businesses. We market electricity, including electricity from our own generation facilities and generation contracted from third parties, as part of our wholesale operations. TCEH's results of operations depend in large part upon wholesale market prices for electricity, natural gas, uranium, coal, fuel oil and transportation in its regional market and other competitive markets and upon prevailing retail electricity rates, which may be impacted by, among other things, actions of regulatory authorities. Market prices may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time. Demand for electricity can fluctuate dramatically, creating periods of substantial under- or over-supply. During periods of over-supply, prices might be depressed. Also, at times, there may be political pressure, or pressure from regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over wholesale and retail energy commodity and transportation rates, to impose price limitations, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address volatility and other issues in these markets.\nSome of the fuel for our generation facilities is purchased under short-term contracts. Prices of fuel (including diesel, natural gas, coal and nuclear fuel) may also be volatile, and the price we can obtain for electricity sales may not change at the same rate as changes in fuel costs. In addition, we purchase and sell natural gas and other energy related commodities, and volatility in these markets may affect costs incurred in meeting obligations.\nVolatility in market prices for fuel and electricity may result from the following:\n\u2022\nvolatility in natural gas prices;\n\u2022\nvolatility in ERCOT market heat rates;\n\u2022\nvolatility in coal and rail transportation prices;\n\u2022\nsevere or unexpected weather conditions, including drought and limitations on access to water;\n\u2022\nseasonality;\n\u2022\nchanges in electricity and fuel usage;\n\u2022\nilliquidity in the wholesale electricity or other commodity markets;\n\u2022\ntransmission or transportation constraints, inoperability or inefficiencies;\n\u2022\navailability of competitively-priced alternative energy sources or storage;\n\u2022\nchanges in market structure;\n\u2022\nchanges in supply and demand for energy commodities, including nuclear fuel and related enrichment and conversion services;\n\u2022\nchanges in the manner in which we operate our facilities, including curtailed operation due to market pricing, environmental, safety or other factors;\n\u2022\nchanges in generation efficiency;\n\u2022\noutages or otherwise reduced output from our generation facilities or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in the credit risk or payment practices of market participants;\n\u2022\nchanges in production and storage levels of natural gas, lignite, coal, crude oil, diesel and other refined products;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, wars, sabotage, terrorist acts, embargoes and other catastrophic events, and\n\u2022\nfederal, state and local energy, environmental and other regulation and legislation.\nAll of our generation facilities are located in the ERCOT market, a market with limited interconnections to other markets. Wholesale electricity prices in the ERCOT market have generally moved with the price of natural gas because marginal electricity demand is generally supplied by natural gas fueled generation facilities. Accordingly, our earnings, cash flows and the value of our nuclear and lignite/coal fueled generation assets, which provided a substantial portion of our supply volumes in 2015, are dependent in significant part upon the price of natural gas. Natural gas prices have generally trended downward since mid-2008 (from $11.12 per MMBtu in mid-2008 to $2.66 per MMBtu for the average settled price for the year ended December 31, 2015). In recent years natural gas supply has outpaced demand as a result of development and expansion of hydraulic fracturing in natural gas extraction. Many industry experts expect this supply/demand imbalance to persist for a number of years, thereby depressing natural gas prices for a long-term period. As a result, our generation assets could materially decrease in profitability and value unless natural gas prices rebound materially.\nWholesale electricity prices also move with ERCOT market heat rates, which could fall if demand for electricity were to decrease or if more efficient generation facilities are built in ERCOT. Accordingly, our earnings, cash flows and the value of our nuclear and lignite/coal fueled generation assets are also dependent in significant part upon market heat rates. As a result, our nuclear and lignite/coal fueled generation assets could significantly decrease in profitability and value if ERCOT market heat rates decline.\nA sustained decrease in the profitability and/or value of our generation units could result in further impairments of such assets and ultimately could result in the retirement or mothballing of certain generation units.\nOur assets or positions cannot be fully hedged against changes in commodity prices and market heat rates, and hedging transactions may not work as planned or hedge counterparties may default on their obligations.\nWe cannot fully hedge the risk associated with changes in commodity prices, most notably electricity and natural gas prices, because of the expected useful life of our generation assets and the size of our position relative to market liquidity. To the extent we have unhedged positions, fluctuating commodity prices and/or market heat rates can materially impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial position, either favorably or unfavorably. Taking together forward wholesale and retail electricity sales with all hedging positions, at December 31, 2015, we had effectively hedged an estimated 94% and 18% of the price exposure, on a natural gas equivalent basis, related to our expected generation output for 2016 and 2017, respectively (assuming an approximate 8.5 market heat rate).\nTo manage our financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, we routinely enter into contracts to hedge portions of purchase and sale commitments, fuel requirements and inventories of natural gas, lignite, coal, diesel fuel, uranium and refined products, and other commodities, within established risk management guidelines. As part of this strategy, we routinely utilize fixed-price forward physical purchase and sale contracts, futures, financial swaps and option contracts traded in over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. Although we devote a considerable amount of time and effort to the establishment of risk management procedures, as well as the ongoing review of the implementation of these procedures, the procedures in place may not always function as planned and cannot eliminate all the risks associated with these activities. For example, we hedge the expected needs of our wholesale and retail customers, but unexpected changes due to weather, natural disasters, consumer behavior, market constraints or other factors could cause us to purchase electricity to meet unexpected demand in periods of high wholesale market prices or resell excess electricity into the wholesale market in periods of low prices. As a result of these and other factors, we cannot precisely predict the impact that risk management decisions may have on our businesses, results of operations, liquidity or financial position.\nWith the tightening of credit markets that began in 2008 and the expansion of regulatory oversight through various financial reforms, there has been some decline in the number of market participants in the wholesale energy commodities markets, resulting in less liquidity, particularly in the ERCOT electricity market. Participation by financial institutions and other intermediaries (including investment banks) has particularly declined. Extended declines in market liquidity could materially affect our ability to hedge our financial exposure to desired levels. In addition, our financial condition and the Chapter 11 Cases have significantly limited the number of counterparties that will enter into commodity hedging transactions with us on attractive terms.\nTo the extent we engage in hedging and risk management activities, we are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe us money, energy or other commodities as a result of these activities will not perform their obligations. Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we could be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor the underlying commitment at then-current market prices. In such event, we could incur losses or forgo expected gains in addition to amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. This risk increased in the coal industry during 2015 when several coal producers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection predominately due to lower demand and increased regulatory pressure. We had no material exposure to the coal producers that filed bankruptcy during 2015. ERCOT market participants are also exposed to risks that another ERCOT market participant may default on its obligations to pay ERCOT for electricity taken, in which case such costs, to the extent not offset by posted security and other protections available to ERCOT, may be allocated to various non-defaulting ERCOT market participants, including us.\nChanges in technology or increased electricity conservation efforts may reduce the value of our generation facilities and/or Oncor's electricity delivery facilities and may otherwise significantly impact our businesses.\nTechnological advances have improved, and are likely to continue to improve, existing and alternative technologies to produce or store electricity, including gas turbines, wind turbines, fuel cells, microturbines, photovoltaic (solar) cells, batteries and concentrated solar thermal devices. Such technological advances have reduced, and are expected to continue to reduce, the costs of electricity production or storage from these technologies to a level that will enable these technologies to compete effectively with traditional generation facilities. Consequently, the profitability and market value of our generation assets could be significantly reduced as a result of these advances. In addition, changes in technology have altered, and are expected to continue to alter, the channels through which retail customers buy electricity (i.e., self-generation facilities). To the extent self-generation facilities become a more cost-effective option for ERCOT customers, our revenues, liquidity and results of operations could be materially reduced.\nTechnological advances in demand-side management and increased conservation efforts have resulted, and are expected to continue to result, in a decrease in electricity demand. A significant decrease in electricity demand in ERCOT as a result of such efforts would significantly reduce the value of our generation assets and electricity delivery facilities. Certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption. Effective energy conservation by our customers could result in reduced energy demand or significantly slow the growth in demand. Such reduction in demand could materially reduce our revenues, liquidity and results of operations. Furthermore, we may incur increased capital expenditures if we are required to increase investment in conservation measures.\nOur liquidity needs could be difficult to satisfy, particularly during times of uncertainty in the financial markets and/or during times when there are significant changes in commodity prices. The inability to access liquidity, particularly on favorable terms, could materially affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. We cannot be certain that the DIP Facilities will ultimately be adequate to cover all of our liquidity needs for the entirety of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nOur businesses are capital intensive. In general, we rely on access to financial markets and credit facilities as a significant source of liquidity for our capital requirements and other obligations not satisfied by cash-on-hand or operating cash flows. The inability to raise capital or access credit facilities, particularly on favorable terms, could adversely impact our liquidity and our ability to meet our obligations or sustain and grow our businesses and could increase capital costs. Our access to the financial markets and credit facilities could be adversely impacted by various factors, such as:\n\u2022\nour Chapter 11 Cases and the related costs;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial markets that reduce available liquidity or the ability to obtain or renew credit facilities on acceptable terms;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness in the ERCOT or general US market;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates;\n\u2022\na deterioration, or perceived deterioration, of EFH Corp.'s (and/or its subsidiaries') creditworthiness or enterprise value;\n\u2022\na reduction in EFH Corp.'s or its applicable subsidiaries' credit ratings;\n\u2022\na deterioration of the creditworthiness or bankruptcy of one or more lenders or counterparties under our credit facilities that affects the ability of such lender(s) to make loans to us;\n\u2022\nvolatility in commodity prices that increases credit requirements;\n\u2022\na material breakdown in our risk management procedures, and\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of changes in our businesses that restrict our ability to access credit facilities.\nIn the event that the governmental agencies that regulate the activities of our businesses determine that the creditworthiness of any such business is inadequate to support our activities, such agencies could require us to provide additional cash or letter of credit collateral in substantial amounts to qualify to do business.\nFurther, a lack of available liquidity could adversely impact the evaluation of our creditworthiness by counterparties and rating agencies. In particular, such concerns by existing and potential counterparties could significantly limit TCEH's wholesale markets activities, including any future hedging activities.\nWe cannot be sure that the DIP Facilities will ultimately be adequate to cover all of our liquidity needs for the entirety of the Chapter 11 Cases, especially if the Plan of Reorganization does not become effective and we are subjected to a more lengthy bankruptcy proceeding. Additionally, the TCEH Debtors and EFIH Debtors, respectively, are subject to various covenants and events of default under their respective DIP Facilities. If we fail to comply with these covenants or an event of default occurs under the DIP Facilities, our liquidity, financial condition or operations may be materially impacted.\nRegulatory and Legislative Risks\nOur businesses are subject to ongoing complex governmental regulations and legislation that have impacted, and may in the future impact, our businesses and/or results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nOur businesses operate in changing market environments influenced by various state and federal legislative and regulatory initiatives regarding the restructuring of the energy industry, including competition in the generation and sale of electricity. We will need to continually adapt to these changes.\nOur businesses are subject to changes in state and federal laws (including PURA, the Federal Power Act, the Atomic Energy Act, the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, the Clean Air Act, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act), changing governmental policy and regulatory actions (including those of the PUCT, the NERC, the TRE, the RCT, the TCEQ, the FERC, the MSHA, the EPA, the NRC and the CFTC) and the rules, guidelines and protocols of ERCOT with respect to matters including, but not limited to, market structure and design, operation of nuclear generation facilities, construction and operation of other generation facilities, construction and operation of transmission facilities, development, operation and reclamation of lignite mines, acquisition, disposal, depreciation and amortization of regulated assets and facilities, recovery of costs and investments, decommissioning costs, return on invested capital for regulated businesses, market behavior rules, present or prospective wholesale and retail competition and environmental matters. TCEH, along with other market participants, is subject to electricity pricing constraints and market behavior and other competition-related rules and regulations under PURA that are administered by the PUCT and ERCOT. Changes in, revisions to, or reinterpretations of existing laws and regulations may have a material effect on our businesses.\nThe Texas Legislature meets every two years. The next regular legislative session is scheduled to begin in January 2017; however, at any time the governor of Texas may convene a special session of the legislature. During any regular or special session, bills may be introduced that, if adopted, could materially affect our businesses, including our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.\nOur cost of compliance with existing and new environmental laws could materially affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental regulation by governmental authorities, including the EPA and the TCEQ. In operating our facilities, we are required to comply with numerous environmental laws and regulations and to obtain numerous governmental permits. We may incur significant additional costs beyond those currently contemplated to comply with these requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to civil or criminal liabilities and fines. Existing environmental regulations could be revised or reinterpreted, new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities, and future changes in environmental laws and regulations could occur, including potential regulatory and enforcement developments related to air emissions, all of which could result in significant additional costs beyond those currently contemplated to comply with existing requirements (see Note 14 to the Financial Statements).\nThe EPA has recently completed several regulatory actions establishing new requirements for control of certain emissions from sources including electricity generation facilities. It is also currently considering several other regulatory actions, as well as contemplating future additional regulatory actions, in each case that may affect our generation facilities or our ability to cost-effectively develop new generation facilities. There is no assurance that the currently-installed emissions control equipment at our lignite/coal fueled generation facilities will satisfy the requirements under any future EPA or TCEQ regulations. Some of the recent regulatory actions and proposed actions, such as the EPA's Regional Haze FIP, CSAPR and MATS, could require us to install significant additional control equipment, resulting in material costs of compliance for our generation units, including capital expenditures, higher operating and fuel costs and potential production curtailments if the rules take effect. These costs could result in material effects on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, if we fail to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval or if an approval is retroactively disallowed, the operation of our generation facilities could be stopped, curtailed or modified or become subject to additional costs.\nIn addition, we may be responsible for any on-site liabilities associated with the environmental condition of facilities that we have acquired, leased or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. In connection with certain acquisitions and sales of assets, we may obtain, or be required to provide, indemnification against certain environmental liabilities. Another party could, depending on the circumstances, assert an environmental claim against us or fail to meet its indemnification obligations to us.\nOur results of operations, liquidity and financial condition may be materially affected if new federal and/or state legislation or regulations are adopted to address global climate change, or if we are subject to lawsuits for alleged damage to persons or property resulting from greenhouse gas emissions.\nThere is a concern nationally and internationally about global climate change and how greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), contribute to global climate change. Over the last few years, proposals have been debated in the US Congress or discussed by the Obama Administration that were intended to address climate change using different approaches, including a cap on carbon emissions with emitters allowed to trade unused emission allowances (cap-and-trade), a tax on carbon or GHG emissions, incentives for the development of low-carbon technology and federal renewable portfolio standards. In addition, a number of federal court cases have been filed in recent years asserting damage claims related to GHG emissions, and the results in those proceedings could establish adverse precedent that might apply to companies (including us) that produce GHG emissions. For more detailed discussion of recent global climate change legislation see Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties - Environmental Regulations and Related Considerations - Global Climate Change. Our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition may be materially affected if new federal and/or state legislation or regulations are adopted to address global climate change, or if we are subject to lawsuits for alleged damage to persons or property resulting from greenhouse gas emissions.\nLuminant's mining permits are subject to RCT review.\nThe RCT reviews on an ongoing basis whether Luminant is compliant with RCT rules and regulations and whether it has met all of the requirements of its mining permits. Any revocation of a mining permit would mean that Luminant would no longer be allowed to mine lignite at the applicable mine to serve its generation facilities. Such event would have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nIn June 2014, the RCT agreed to accept a collateral bond from TCEH of up to $1.1 billion, as a substitute for its self-bond, to secure mining land reclamation obligations. The collateral bond was a $1.1 billion carve-out from the super-priority liens under the TCEH DIP Facility that enables the RCT to be paid before the TCEH DIP Facility lenders in the event such collateral bond was called. There can be no assurance that the RCT will continue to accept this form of collateral bond throughout the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases. If we were required to secure our mining reclamation with cash or a letter of credit, our liquidity and financial condition would be materially and adversely impacted.\nA condition to the completion of the transactions contemplated by the Plan of Reorganization is that the RCT approve Luminant's post-emergence bonding application. If Luminant were required to secure its post-emergence reclamation obligations with cash or a letter of credit, its liquidity and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. There can be no assurance that the RCT will approve Luminant's proposed post-emergence bonding application.\nLitigation, legal proceedings, regulatory investigations or other administrative proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and reputation damage, and have a material effect on our results of operations, and the litigation environment in which we operate poses a significant risk to our businesses.\nWe are involved in the ordinary course of business in a number of lawsuits involving employment, commercial, and environmental issues, and other claims for injuries and damages, among other matters. We evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these evaluations and estimates, we establish reserves and disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These evaluations and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from current evaluations and estimates. The settlement or resolution of such claims or proceedings may have a material effect on our results of operations. We use appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against us, but the litigation environment poses a significant business risk.\nWe are involved in the ordinary course of business in permit applications and renewals, and we are exposed to the risk that certain of our operating permit applications may not be granted or that certain of our operating permits may not be renewed on satisfactory terms. Failure to obtain and maintain the necessary permits to conduct our businesses could have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nWe are also involved in the ordinary course of business in regulatory investigations and other administrative proceedings, and we are exposed to the risk that we may become the subject of additional regulatory investigations or administrative proceedings. See Note 14 to the Financial Statements, Litigation Related to EPA Reviews. While we cannot predict the outcome of any regulatory investigation or administrative proceeding, any such regulatory investigation or administrative proceeding could result in us incurring material penalties and/or other costs and have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nOur collateral requirements for hedging arrangements could be materially impacted if the remaining rules implementing the Financial Reform Act broaden the scope of the Act's provisions regarding the regulation of over-the-counter financial derivatives, making certain provisions applicable to end-users like us.\nIn July 2010, the US Congress enacted financial reform legislation known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Financial Reform Act). While the legislation is broad and detailed, a few key rulemaking decisions remain to be made by federal governmental agencies to fully implement the Financial Reform Act.\nIn November 2015 and January 2016, the prudential regulators and the CFTC, respectively, published final rules and interim final rules on margin requirements. The margin rules do not directly apply to non-financial end users. However, transaction costs may increase and liquidity may decrease as operating costs for registered entities increases under the margin rules. The rule has a phased in approach starting in September 2016. In addition, in December 2013, the CFTC published its new proposed Position Limit Rule (PLR). The PLR provides for specific position limits related to futures and swap contracts that we utilize in our hedging activities. The proposed PLR will require that we comply with the portion of the PLR applicable to these contracts, which will result in increased monitoring and reporting requirements and can also impact the types of contracts that we utilize as hedging instruments in our operations.\nThe rates of Oncor's electricity delivery business are subject to regulatory review, and may be reduced below current levels, which could adversely impact Oncor's results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nThe rates charged by Oncor are regulated by the PUCT and certain cities and are subject to cost-of-service regulation and annual earnings oversight. This regulatory treatment does not provide any assurance as to achievement of earnings levels. Oncor's rates are regulated based on an analysis of Oncor's costs and capital structure, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding. While rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that the PUCT will judge all of Oncor's costs to have been prudently incurred, that the PUCT will not reduce the amount of invested capital included in the capital structure that Oncor's rates are based upon, or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that will produce full recovery of Oncor's costs, including regulatory assets reported on Oncor's balance sheet, and the return on invested capital allowed by the PUCT. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Significant Activities and Events and Items Influencing Future Performance - Oncor Matters with the PUCT for discussion of recent and pending rate-related filings with the PUCT.\nThe REP certification of our retail operation is subject to PUCT review.\nThe PUCT may at any time initiate an investigation into whether our retail operation complies with certain PUCT rules and whether we have met all of the requirements for REP certification, including financial requirements. In addition, as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, the PUCT may initiate additional reviews of our retail operation, including with respect to its creditworthiness. Any removal or revocation of a REP certification would mean that we would no longer be allowed to provide electricity service to retail customers. Such decertification could have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nOperational Risks\nWe may suffer material losses, costs and liabilities due to ownership and operation of the Comanche Peak nuclear generation facility.\nThe ownership and operation of a nuclear generation facility involves certain risks. These risks include:\n\u2022\nunscheduled outages or unexpected costs due to equipment, mechanical, structural, cyber security or other problems;\n\u2022\ninadequacy or lapses in maintenance protocols;\n\u2022\nthe impairment of reactor operation and safety systems due to human error or force majeure;\n\u2022\nthe costs of storage, handling and disposal of nuclear materials, including availability of storage space;\n\u2022\nthe costs of procuring nuclear fuel;\n\u2022\nterrorist or cyber security attacks and the cost to protect against any such attack;\n\u2022\nthe impact of a natural disaster;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the amounts and types of insurance coverage commercially available, and\n\u2022\nuncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear facilities at the end of their useful lives.\nThe prolonged unavailability of Comanche Peak could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. The following are among the more significant of these risks:\n\u2022\nOperational Risk - Operations at any nuclear generation facility could degrade to the point where the facility would have to be shut down. If such degradations were to occur, the process of identifying and correcting the causes of the operational downgrade to return the facility to operation could require significant time and expense, resulting in both lost revenue and increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments. Furthermore, a shut-down or failure at any other nuclear generation facility could cause regulators to require a shut-down or reduced availability at Comanche Peak.\n\u2022\nRegulatory Risk - The NRC may modify, suspend or revoke licenses and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, the regulations under it or the terms of the licenses of nuclear generation facilities. Unless extended, the NRC operating licenses for Comanche Peak Unit 1 and Unit 2 will expire in 2030 and 2033, respectively. In addition, as a result of the Bankruptcy Filing, the NRC may initiate additional reviews of our operations at Comanche Peak, including with respect to our ability to fund our operations in compliance with our operating license. Changes in regulations by the NRC, including potential regulation as a result of the NRC's ongoing analysis and response to the effects of the natural disaster on nuclear generation facilities in Japan in 2010, could require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or result in increased operating or decommissioning costs.\n\u2022\nNuclear Accident Risk - Although the safety record of Comanche Peak and other nuclear generation facilities generally has been very good, accidents and other unforeseen problems have occurred both in the US and elsewhere. The consequences of an accident can be severe and include loss of life, injury, lasting negative health impact and property damage. Any accident, or perceived accident, could result in significant liabilities and damage our reputation. Any such resulting liability from a nuclear accident could exceed our resources, including insurance coverage, and could ultimately result in the suspension or termination of electricity generation from Comanche Peak.\nThe operation and maintenance of electricity generation and delivery facilities involves significant risks that could adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nThe operation and maintenance of electricity generation and delivery facilities involves many risks, including, as applicable, start-up risks, breakdown or failure of facilities, operator error, lack of sufficient capital to maintain the facilities, the dependence on a specific fuel source or the impact of unusual or adverse weather conditions or other natural events, or terrorist attacks, as well as the risk of performance below expected levels of output, efficiency or reliability, the occurrence of any of which could result in lost revenues and/or increased expenses. A significant number of our facilities were constructed many years ago. In particular, older generating equipment and transmission and distribution equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant capital expenditures to keep operating at peak efficiency or reliability. The risk of increased maintenance and capital expenditures arises from (i) increased starting and stopping of generation equipment due to the volatility of the competitive generation market and the prospect of continuing low wholesale electricity prices that may not justify sustained or year-round operation of all our generation facilities, (ii) any unexpected failure to generate electricity, including failure caused by equipment breakdown or forced outage, (iii) damage to facilities due to storms, natural disasters, wars, terrorist or cyber security acts and other catastrophic events and (iv) the passage of time and normal wear and tear. Further, our ability to successfully and timely complete capital improvements to existing facilities or other capital projects is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. Should any such efforts be unsuccessful, we could be subject to additional costs and/or losses and write downs of our investment in the project or improvement.\nWe cannot be certain of the level of capital expenditures that will be required due to changing environmental and safety laws and regulations (including changes in the interpretation or enforcement thereof), needed facility repairs and unexpected events (such as natural disasters or terrorist or cyber security attacks). The unexpected requirement of large capital expenditures could materially affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nOur employees, contractors, customers and the general public may be exposed to a risk of injury due to the nature of our operations.\nEmployees and contractors throughout our organization work in, and customers and the general public may be exposed to, potentially dangerous environments near our operations. As a result, employees, contractors, customers and the general public are at risk for serious injury, including loss of life. Significant risks include nuclear accidents, dam failure, gas explosions, mine area collapses, pole strikes and other cases.\nOur results of operations, liquidity and financial condition may be materially affected by the effects of extreme weather conditions.\nOur results of operations, liquidity and financial condition may be materially affected by weather conditions and may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis as the weather changes. In addition, we could be subject to the effects of extreme weather. Extreme weather conditions could stress our transmission and distribution system or our generation facilities resulting in outages, increased maintenance and capital expenditures. Extreme weather events, including sustained cold or hot temperatures, hurricanes, storms or other natural disasters, could be destructive and result in casualty losses that are not ultimately offset by insurance proceeds or in increased capital expenditures or costs, including supply chain costs.\nMoreover, an extreme weather event could cause disruption in service to customers due to downed wires and poles or damage to other operating equipment, which could result in us foregoing sales of electricity and lost revenue. Similarly, an extreme weather event might affect the availability of generation and transmission capacity, limiting our ability to source or deliver electricity where it is needed or limit our ability to source fuel for our plants (including due to damage to rail or natural gas pipeline infrastructure). Additionally, extreme weather may result in unexpected increases in customer load, requiring our retail operation to procure additional electricity supplies at wholesale prices in excess of customer sales prices for electricity. These conditions, which cannot be reliably predicted, could have an adverse consequence by requiring us to seek additional sources of electricity when wholesale market prices are high or to sell excess electricity when market prices are low.\nAttacks on our infrastructure that breach cyber/data security measures could expose us to significant liabilities and reputation damage and disrupt business operations, which could have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nMuch of our information technology infrastructure is connected (directly or indirectly) to the Internet. There have been numerous attacks on government and industry information technology systems through the Internet that have resulted in material operational, reputation and/or financial costs. While we have controls in place designed to protect our infrastructure and have not had any significant breaches, a breach of cyber/data security measures that impairs our information technology infrastructure could disrupt normal business operations and affect our ability to control our generation and transmission and distribution assets, access retail customer information and limit communication with third parties. Any loss of confidential or proprietary data through a breach could adversely affect our reputation, expose the company to material legal/regulatory claims, impair our ability to execute on business strategies and/or materially affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nAs part of the continuing development of new and modified reliability standards, the FERC has approved changes to its Critical Infrastructure Protection reliability standards and has established standards for assets identified as \"critical cyber assets.\" Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the FERC can impose penalties (up to $1 million per day, per violation) for failure to comply with mandatory electric reliability standards, including standards to protect the power system against potential disruptions from cyber and physical security breaches.\nFurther, our retail business requires access to sensitive customer data in the ordinary course of business. Examples of sensitive customer data are names, addresses, account information, historical electricity usage, expected patterns of use, payment history, credit bureau data, credit and debit card account numbers, driver license numbers, social security numbers and bank account information. Our retail business may need to provide sensitive customer data to vendors and service providers who require access to this information in order to provide services, such as call center operations, to the retail business. If a significant breach occurred, the reputation of our retail business may be adversely affected, customer confidence may be diminished, or our retail business may be subject to legal claims, any of which may contribute to the loss of customers and have a negative impact on the business and our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nOur retail operation (TXU Energy) may lose a significant number of customers due to competitive marketing activity by other retail electric providers.\nOur retail operation faces competition for customers. Competitors may offer lower prices and other incentives, or attempt to use the Chapter 11 Cases against us, which, despite the business' long-standing relationship with customers, may attract customers away from us. We operate in a very competitive retail market, as is reflected in a 16% decline in customers (based on meters) served over the last five years.\nIn some retail electricity markets, our principal competitor may be the incumbent REP. The incumbent REP has the advantage of long-standing relationships with its customers, including well-known brand recognition.\nIn addition to competition from the incumbent REP, we may face competition from a number of other energy service providers, other energy industry participants, or nationally branded providers of consumer products and services who may develop businesses that will compete with us. Some of these competitors or potential competitors may be larger or better capitalized than we are. If there is inadequate potential margin in these retail electricity markets, it may not be profitable for us to compete in these markets.\nOur retail operations rely on the infrastructure of local utilities or independent transmission system operators to provide electricity to, and to obtain information about, our customers. Any infrastructure failure could negatively impact customer satisfaction and could have a material negative impact on the business and results of operations.\nOur retail operations depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by unaffiliated utilities, as well as Oncor's facilities, to deliver the electricity we sell to our customers. If transmission capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver electricity may be hindered, and we may have to forgo sales or buy more expensive wholesale electricity than is available in the capacity-constrained area. For example, during some periods, transmission access is constrained in some areas of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, where we have a significant number of customers. The cost to provide service to these customers may exceed the cost to provide service to other customers, resulting in lower profits. In addition, any infrastructure failure that interrupts or impairs delivery of electricity to our customers could negatively impact customer satisfaction with our service.\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted by any development or event beyond our control that causes economic weakness in the ERCOT market.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from operations in the ERCOT market, which covers approximately 75% of the geographical area in the State of Texas. As a result, regardless of the state of the economy in areas outside the ERCOT market, economic weakness in the ERCOT market could lead to reduced demand for electricity in the ERCOT market. Such a reduction could have a material negative impact on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nThe loss of the services of our key management and personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate our businesses.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. We compete for such personnel with many other companies, in and outside our industry, government entities and other organizations. We may not be successful in retaining current personnel or in hiring or retaining qualified personnel in the future. Our failure to attract new personnel or retain existing personnel could have a material effect on our businesses.", "PERMNO": 24563, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "0033A"}
