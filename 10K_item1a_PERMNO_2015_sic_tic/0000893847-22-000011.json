{"cik": "893847", "company": "HAWTHORN BANCSHARES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisk Factors\nWe are identifying important risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition or business and that could cause them to differ materially from the Company's historical results of operations, financial condition or business, or those contemplated by forward-looking statements made herein or elsewhere, by, or on behalf of, the Company. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those factors described below. The risk factors highlighted below are not necessarily the only ones that the Company faces.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Market\nPublic health threats or outbreaks of communicable diseases has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely effect on the Company's operations and financial results. The Company and the Bank may face risks related to public health threats or outbreaks of communicable diseases. A widespread healthcare crisis, such as an outbreak of a communicable disease could adversely affect the global economy and the Company's financial performance. For example, the ongoing global Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has destabilized the financial markets in which the Bank operates, and likely will continue to cause significant disruption in the global economies and financial markets, including the Bank's local markets. The Company and the Bank are dependent upon the willingness and ability of the Bank's customers to conduct banking and other financial transactions. In reaction to and as preventative measure to attempt to slow the spread of the pandemic, government authorities have in many states and municipalities implemented mandatory closures, shelter-in-place orders, and social distancing protocols, including orders within many of the geographic areas that the Bank operates. Although the Bank is typically considered an essential business, access to its branches and office locations have been restricted at times for the safety of its employees and customers. Limiting customers' access to the Bank's physical business could prevent some customers from transacting with the Bank and lower demand for lending and other services offered by the Bank, adversely affecting the Bank's and the Company's cash flows, financial condition, results of operations, profitability and asset quality and could continue to do so for an indefinite period of time. This could have a material adverse effect on the Bank's and Company's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. In particular, the continued spread of COVID-19 and efforts to contain the virus could:\n\u2022negatively impact customer demand of the Bank's lending and related services;\n\u2022cause the Bank to experience an increase in costs as a result of the Bank implementing operational\n\u25aachanges to accommodate its newly-remote workforce;\n\u2022cause delayed payments from customers and uncollectible accounts, defaults, foreclosures, and declining\n\u25aacollateral values, resulting in losses to the Bank and the Company;\n\u2022result in losses on the Bank's investment portfolio, due to volatility in the markets and lower trading\n\u25aavolume driven by economic uncertainty;\n\u2022cause market interest rates to continue to decline, which could adversely affect the Bank's and the\n\u25aaCompany's net interest income and profitability;\n\u2022cause the Bank's credit losses to grow substantially; and\n\u2022impact availability of qualified personnel.\nThe situation surrounding COVID-19 remains uncertain and the potential for a material adverse impact on the Bank and the Company increases the longer the virus impacts activity levels in the United States and globally. The ultimate extent of the negative impact on the Bank and the Company are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. The Bank and the Company continue to adapt to the changing dynamics of the COVID-19 impacts to the economy, needs of employees and customers, and authoritative measures mandated by federal, state, and local governments. However, there is no assurance that the Bank and the Company can adequately mitigate the risks of such business disruptions and interruptions. Beyond the current COVID-19 pandemic, the potential impacts of epidemics, pandemics, or other outbreaks of an illness, disease, or virus could therefore materially and adversely affect the Bank's and the Company's business, revenue, operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nBecause We Primarily Serve Central And West Central Missouri, A Decline In The Local Economic Conditions Could Lower The Company's Profitability. The profitability of Hawthorn is dependent on the profitability of its banking subsidiary, which operates out of central and west central Missouri. The financial condition of this bank is affected by fluctuations in the economic conditions and business activity prevailing in the portion of Missouri in which its operations are located. Although our customers' business and financial interests may extend well beyond our market areas, the financial conditions of both Hawthorn and its banking subsidiary would be adversely affected by deterioration in the general economic and real estate climate in Missouri.\nAn increase in unemployment, a decrease in profitability of regional businesses or real estate values or an increase in interest rates are among the factors that could weaken the local economy. With a weaker local economy:\n\u2022customers may not want or need the products and services of the Bank,\n\u2022borrowers may be unable to repay their loans,\n\u2022the value of the collateral security of the Bank's loans to borrowers may decline,\n\u2022the number of loan delinquencies and foreclosures may increase, and\n\u2022the overall quality of the Bank's loan portfolio may decline.\nOriginating mortgage loans and consumer loans is a significant source of profits for Hawthorn's banking subsidiary. If individual customers in the local area do not want or need these loans, profits may decrease. Although the Bank could make other investments, the Bank may earn less revenue on these investments than on loans. Also, the Bank's losses on loans may increase if borrowers are unable to make payments on their loans.\nInterest Rate Changes May Reduce The Profitability Of The Company And Of The Bank. The primary source of earnings for Hawthorn's banking subsidiary is net interest income. To be profitable, the Bank has to earn more money in interest and fees on loans and other interest-earning assets than it pays as interest on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities and as other expenses. If prevailing interest rates decrease, the amount of interest the Bank earn on loans and investment securities may decrease more rapidly than the amount of interest the Bank has to pay on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. This would result in a decrease in the profitability of Hawthorn and its banking subsidiary.\nChanges in the level or structure of interest rates also affect:\n\u2022the Bank's ability to originate loans,\n\u2022the value of the Bank's loan and securities portfolios,\n\u2022the Bank's ability to realize gains from the sale of loans and securities,\n\u2022the average life of the Bank's deposits, and\n\u2022the Bank's ability to obtain deposits.\nFluctuations in interest rates will ultimately affect both the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of the Bank's assets and liabilities, and the fair value of all interest-earning assets, other than interest-earning assets that mature in the short term. The Bank's interest rate management strategy is designed to stabilize net interest income and preserve capital over a broad range of interest rate movements by matching the interest rate sensitivity of assets and liabilities. Although Hawthorn believes that the Bank's current mix of loans, mortgage-backed securities, investment\nsecurities and deposits is reasonable, significant fluctuations in interest rates may have a negative effect on the profitability of the Bank.\nOur Business Depends On Our Ability To Successfully Manage Credit Risk. The operation of our business requires us to manage credit risk. As a lender, our banking subsidiary is exposed to the risk that borrowers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms, and that the collateral securing repayment of their loans, if any, may not be sufficient to ensure repayment. In addition, there are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan may be repaid, risks relating to proper loan underwriting, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions and risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers. In order to successfully manage credit risk, we must, among other things, maintain disciplined and prudent underwriting standards and ensure that our loan officers follow those standards. The weakening of these standards for any reason, such as an attempt to attract higher yielding loans, a lack of discipline or diligence by our employees in underwriting and monitoring loans, the inability of our employees to adequately adapt policies and procedures to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting borrowers and the quality of our loan portfolio, may result in loan defaults, foreclosures and additional charge-offs and may necessitate that we significantly increase our allowance for loan losses, each of which could adversely affect our net income. As a result, our inability to successfully manage credit risk could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company's Profitability Depends On The Bank's Asset Quality And Lending Risks. Success in the banking industry largely depends on the quality of loans and other assets. A significant source of risk for us arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained because borrowers, guarantors and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans. The loan officers of Hawthorn's banking subsidiary are actively encouraged to identify deteriorating loans. Loans are also monitored and categorized through an analysis of their payment status. The Bank's failure to timely and accurately monitor the quality of its loans and other assets could have a materially adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of Hawthorn and its banking subsidiary. There is a degree of credit risk associated with any lending activity. The Bank attempts to minimize its credit risk through loan diversification. Although the Bank's loan portfolio is varied, with no undue concentration in any one industry, substantially all of the loans in the portfolio have been made to borrowers in central, west central, and southwest Missouri. Therefore, the loan portfolio is susceptible to factors affecting the central, west central, and southwest Missouri area and the level of non-performing assets is heavily dependent upon local conditions. There can be no assurance that the level of the Bank's non-performing assets will not increase above current levels. High levels of non-performing assets could have a materially adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of Hawthorn and its banking subsidiary.\nThe Provision For Probable Loan Losses May Need To Be Increased. Hawthorn's banking subsidiary makes a provision for loan losses based upon management's estimate of probable losses in the loan portfolio and its consideration of prevailing economic and environmental conditions. The amount of future loan losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, which may be beyond the Company's control, and these losses may exceed current estimates. We cannot fully predict the amount or timing of losses or whether the loss allowance will be adequate in the future. The Bank may need to increase the provision for loan losses through additional provisions in the future if, among other things, the financial condition of any of its borrowers deteriorates, if its borrower fails to perform its obligations to it, or if real estate values decline. Furthermore, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Bank's loan portfolio, provision for loan losses, and real estate acquired by foreclosure. Such agencies may require the Bank to recognize additions to the provision for loan losses based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of the examination. Any additional provision for probable loan losses, whether required as a result of regulatory review or initiated by Hawthorn itself, may materially alter the financial outlook of Hawthorn and its banking subsidiary and may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nIn June of 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, decided to review how banks estimate losses in the allowance calculation, and it issued the final current expected credit loss standard, or CECL. Currently, the impairment model is based on incurred losses, and investments are recognized as impaired when there is no longer an assumption that future cash flows will be collected in full under the originally contracted terms. This model will be replaced by the new CECL model that will become effective for the Company in January 2023. Under the new CECL model promulgated under ASU 2016-13 \"Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\", we will be required to use historical information, current conditions and reasonable forecasts to estimate the expected loss over the life of the loan and record an allowance that, when deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, presents the net amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The CECL model is expected to result in more timely recognition of credit losses. The ASU will require new disclosures for financial assets\nmeasured at amortized cost, loans and available-for-sale debt securities. Entities will apply the standard's provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. The transition to the CECL model will bring with it significantly greater data requirements and changes to methodologies to accurately account for expected losses under the new parameters.\nManagement is currently evaluating the impact of these changes to our financial position and results of operations. We anticipate a significant change in the processes and procedures to calculate the allowance, including changes in assumptions and estimates to consider expected credit losses over the life of the loan versus the current accounting practice that utilizes the incurred loss model. We expect to continue developing and implementing processes and procedures to ensure we are fully compliant with the CECL requirements at its adoption date. The allowance is a material estimate of ours, and given the change from an incurred loss model to a methodology that considers the credit loss over the life of the loan, there is the potential for an increase in the allowance at adoption date. At this time, an estimate of the impact to the Company's financial statements is not known, but the impact could be significantly impacted by the composition, characteristics and quality of the underlying loan portfolio at the time of adoption. The Company has formed a committee and is continuing to evaluate the impact of the ASU's adoption on the Company's consolidated financial statements by assessing different credit risk models. As a result of the FASB issuing a delay in the implementation of this ASU, the Company will extend its evaluation process leading up to the new implementation deadline of January 2023.\nAdverse Market Conditions In The U.S. Economy And The Markets In Which We Operate Could Adversely Impact The Company's Business. General downward economic trends, reduced availability of commercial credit, and increasing unemployment have negatively impacted the credit performance of commercial and consumer credit, resulting in additional write-downs. Concerns over the stability of the financial markets and the economy have resulted in decreased lending by financial institutions to their customers and to each other. This market turmoil and tightening of credit has led to increased commercial and consumer deficiencies, lack of customer confidence, increased market volatility and widespread reduction in general business activity. Competition among depository institutions for deposits has increased significantly. Financial institutions have experienced decreased access to deposits or borrowings.\nAlthough there has been a modest recovery in the domestic economy, there can be no assurance that the economy will not enter into another recession, whether in the near or long term future. In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic, our growth was bolstered by government programs that may not continue, such as the SBA Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) pursuant to which we issued PPP loans in 2020 and 2021. Furthermore, real estate values and the demand for commercial real estate loans have not fully recovered, and reduced availability of commercial credit and continuing unemployment have negatively impacted the credit performance of commercial and consumer credit. Additional market developments such as a relapse or worsening of economic conditions in other parts of the world would likely exacerbate the lingering effects of the difficult market conditions experienced by us and others in the financial services industry and could further slow, stall or reverse the slow recovery in the U.S. A further deterioration of overall market conditions, a continuation of the economic downturn or prolonged economic stagnation in the Company's markets may have a negative impact on its business, financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of its common stock. If the strength of the U.S. economy in general and the strength of the economy in areas where we lend were to stagnate or decline, this could result in, among other things, a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit, including a resultant adverse effect on the Company's loan portfolio and provision for losses on loans. This may exacerbate the Company's exposure to credit risk, impair the Company's ability to assess the creditworthiness of its customers or to estimate the values of its assets and adversely affect the ability of borrowers to perform under the terms of their lending arrangements with us. Negative conditions in the real estate markets where we operate could adversely affect borrowers' ability to repay their loans and the value of the underlying collateral. Real estate values are affected by various factors, including general economic conditions, governmental rules or policies and natural disasters. These factors may adversely impact borrowers' ability to make required payments, which in turn, may negatively impact the Company's financial results. As a result of the difficult market and economic conditions referred to above, there is a potential for new federal or state laws and regulations regarding lending and funding practices and liquidity standards, and for bank regulatory agencies to be very aggressive in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations. This increased government action may increase costs and limit the Company's ability to pursue certain business opportunities.\nWe cannot predict whether the difficult market and economic conditions will improve in the near future. A worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult conditions on the Company, its customers and the other financial institutions in its market. As a result, we may experience increases in foreclosures, delinquencies and customer bankruptcies, as well as more restricted access to funds, and the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price may be adversely affected.\nThe Soundness Of Other Financial Institutions Could Adversely Affect Us. The Company's ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial\ninstitutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client. In addition, the Company's credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect the Company's results of operations.\nDeterioration In The Housing Market Could Cause Further Increases In Delinquencies And Non-Performing Assets, Including Loan Charge-Offs, And Depress The Company's Income And Growth. The volume of one-to-four family residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit may decrease during economic downturns as a result of, among other things, a decrease in real estate values, an increase in unemployment, a slowdown in housing price appreciation or increases in interest rates. These factors could reduce earnings and consequently the Company's financial condition because:\n\u2022borrowers may not be able to repay their loans;\n\u2022the value of the collateral securing loans may decline further;\n\u2022the quality of the Company's loan portfolio may decline further; and\n\u2022customers may not want or need the Company's products and services.\nAny of these scenarios could cause an increase in delinquencies and non-performing assets, require us to charge-off a higher percentage of loans, increase substantially the provision for losses on loans, or make fewer loans, which would reduce income.\nThe FDIC's Changes in the Calculation of Deposit Insurance Premiums and Ability to Levy Special Assessments Could Increase The Company's Non-Interest Expense And May Reduce Its Profitability. The range of base assessment rates historically varies from 12 to 45 basis points depending on an institution's risk category, with newly added financial measures resulting in increased assessment rates for institutions heavily relying on brokered deposits to support rapid asset growth. However, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to amend its regulations to redefine the assessment base used for calculating deposit insurance assessments. On February 9, 2011, the FDIC adopted a final rule that defines the assessment base as the average consolidated total assets during the assessment period minus the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period. The FDIC also imposed a new assessment rate scale (which was revised further in 2016). Under the new system, banks will pay assessments at a rate between 3 and 30 basis points per assets minus tangible equity, depending upon an institution's risk category (the final rule also includes progressively lower assessment rate schedules when the FDIC's reserve ratio reaches certain levels). The rulemaking changes the current assessment rate schedule so the schedule will result in the collection of assessment revenue that is approximately the same as generated under the current rate schedule and current assessment base. Nearly all banks with assets less than $10 billion will pay smaller deposit insurance assessments as a result of the new rule. The majority of the changes in the FDIC's final rule became effective on April 1, 2011. The FDIC has the statutory authority to impose special assessments on insured depository institutions in an amount, and for such purposes, as the FDIC may deem necessary. The change in the calculation methodology for deposit insurance premiums and the possible emergency special assessments could increase non-interest expense and may adversely affect the Company's profitability.\nWe May Elect Or Be Compelled To Seek Additional Capital In The Future, But That Capital May Not Be Available When It Is Needed. We are required by regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support operations. In addition, we may elect to raise additional capital to support the growth of the Company's business or to finance acquisitions, if any, or we may elect to raise additional capital for other reasons. In that regard, a number of financial institutions have recently raised considerable amounts of capital as a result of a deterioration in their results of operations and financial condition arising from the turmoil in the mortgage loan market, deteriorating economic conditions, declines in real estate values and other factors. Should we elect or be required by regulatory authorities to raise additional capital, we may seek to do so through the issuance of, among other things, common stock or securities convertible into common stock, which could dilute your ownership interest in the Company. Although we remain \"well-capitalized\" and have not had a deterioration in liquidity, the future cost and availability of capital may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, many of which are outside of the Company's control.\nAccordingly, we cannot assure you of the ability to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed or on terms acceptable to us, it may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nIf We Are Unable To Successfully Compete For Customers In The Company's Market Area, the Company's Financial Condition And Results Of Operations Could Be Adversely Affected. Hawthorn's banking subsidiary faces substantial competition in making loans, attracting deposits and providing other financial products and services. The Bank has numerous competitors for customers in its market area.\nSuch competition for loans comes principally from:\n\u2022other commercial banks\n\u2022savings banks\n\u2022savings and loan associations\n\u2022mortgage banking companies\n\u2022finance companies\n\u2022credit unions\nCompetition for deposits comes principally from:\n\u2022other commercial banks\n\u2022savings banks\n\u2022savings and loan associations\n\u2022credit unions\n\u2022brokerage firms\n\u2022insurance companies\n\u2022money market mutual funds\n\u2022mutual funds (such as corporate and government securities funds)\nMany of these competitors have greater financial resources and name recognition, more locations, more advanced technology and more financial products to offer than the Bank. Competition from larger institutions may increase due to an acceleration of bank mergers and consolidations in Missouri and the rest of the nation. In addition, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act removes many of the remaining restrictions in federal banking law against cross-ownership between banks and other financial institutions, such as insurance companies and securities firms. The law will likely increase the number and financial strength of companies that compete directly with the Bank.\nThe profitability of the Bank depends of its continued ability to attract new customers and compete in it service areas. Increased competition in our markets from new competitors, as well as the expanding operations of existing competitors, may result in:\n\u2022interest rate changes to various types of accounts\n\u2022a decrease in the amounts of the Bank's loans and deposits\n\u2022reduced spreads between loan rates and deposit rates\n\u2022loan terms that are less favorable to the bank.\nAny of these results could have a material adverse impact on the Bank's market share of deposits and loans in the Bank's service areas. If the Bank is unable to successfully compete, its financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe May Experience Difficulties In Managing Growth And In Effectively Integrating Newly Acquired Companies. As part of the Company's general strategy, it may continue to acquire banks and businesses that it believes provide a strategic fit with its business. To the extent that the Company does grow, there can be no assurances that we will be able to adequately and profitably manage such growth. Acquiring other banks and businesses will involve risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including:\n\u2022potential exposure to liabilities of the banks and businesses acquired;\n\u2022difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the banks and businesses acquired;\n\u2022difficulty and expense of instituting the necessary systems and procedures, including accounting and financial reporting systems, to manage the combined enterprises on a profitable basis;\n\u2022potential disruption to existing business and operations;\n\u2022potential diversion of the time and attention of management; and\n\u2022impairment of relationships with and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the banks and businesses acquired.\nThe success of the Company's internal growth strategy will depend primarily on the ability of the Bank to generate an increasing level of loans and deposits at acceptable risk levels and on acceptable terms without significant increases in non-interest expenses relative to revenues generated. There is no assurance that we will be successful in implementing the Company's internal growth strategy.\nThe Bank Is A Community Bank And Our Ability To Maintain The Bank's Reputation Is Critical To The Success Of Our Business And The Failure To Do So Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Performance. The Bank is a community bank, and its reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates. If our reputation is negatively affected, by the actions of our employees or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nPhase-out of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and uncertainty relating to alternative reference rates may adversely affect our results of operations. LIBOR is used extensively as a reference rate for various financial contracts, including adjustable-rate loans, asset-backed securities, and interest rate swaps. In July 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021, such date was later extended to June 30, 2023. Accordingly, continuation of LIBOR cannot be guaranteed after June 30, 2023 and alternative reference rates must be established. Management is currently evaluating the impact of this transition as it relates to new and existing contracts and customers. We will be required to implement substitute indices for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements and we are currently evaluating appropriate alternatives to LIBOR. Implementing the LIBOR phase-out will involve additional expense and may reduce the value of our LIBOR-based loans and securities and impact the availability and cost of hedging instruments and borrowings. If we fail to successfully execute the transition, we may be subject to disputes or litigation with clients over the appropriateness of substitute LIBOR indices. The ultimate impact of the LIBOR phase-out on the valuations, pricing and operation of our financial instruments is not yet known and difficult to predict and may adversely affect our results of operations. At December 31, 2021, $12.6 million of our loans were tied to LIBOR.\nThe Company's Success Largely Depends On The Efforts Of Its Executive Officers. The success of Hawthorn and its banking subsidiary has been largely dependent on the efforts of David Turner, Chairman, CEO, and President and the other executive officers. These individuals are expected to continue to perform their services. However, the loss of the services of Mr. Turner, or any of the other key executive officers could have a materially adverse effect on Hawthorn and its subsidiary bank.\nIf We Fail To Maintain An Effective System Of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, We May Not Be Able To Accurately Report Our Financial Results Or Prevent Fraud, And, As A Result, Investors And Depositors Could Lose Confidence In Our Financial Reporting, Which Could Adversely Affect Our Business, The Trading Price Of Our Stock, And Our Ability To Attract Additional Deposits. We are required to include in our annual reports filed with the SEC a report from our management regarding internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we documented and evaluated our internal control over financial reporting in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC rules and regulations, which require an annual management report on our internal control over financial reporting, including, among other matters, management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Failure or circumvention of our system of internal control could have an adverse effect on our business, profitability, and financial condition, and could result in regulatory actions and loss of investor confidence. Additionally, if we fail to identify and correct any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or fail to prevent fraud, current and potential stockholders and depositors could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, the trading price of our stock and our ability to attract additional deposits.\nRisks Relating to Our Regulatory Environment\nWe May Be Adversely Affected By Changes In Laws And Regulations Affecting The Financial Services Industry. Banks and bank holding companies such as Hawthorn are subject to regulation by both federal and state bank regulatory agencies. The regulations, which are designed to protect borrowers and promote certain social policies, include limitations on the operations of banks and bank holding companies, such as minimum capital requirements and restrictions\non dividend payments. The regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervision and enforcement activities and their examination policies, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a bank, the classification of assets by an institution and requiring an increase in a bank's allowance for loan losses. These regulations are not necessarily designed to maximize the profitability of banking institutions.\nIn July 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act, which enacted substantial changes to the legal framework of the entire financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates the passage of numerous rules and regulations by various regulatory agencies over the next few years. This legislation will change banking regulation and the operating environment of Hawthorn in substantial and unpredictable ways. It could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions and other financial institutions. Hawthorn cannot predict the impact that the Dodd-Frank Act, and the various regulations issued thereunder will have on its business.\nThese, and other future changes in the banking laws and regulations and tax and accounting rules applicable to financial institutions, could have a material adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of Hawthorn and its banking subsidiary.\nThe Short-Term And Long-Term Impact Of The Changing Regulatory Capital Requirements And New Capital Rules Is Uncertain. The federal banking agencies have substantially amended the regulatory capital rules applicable to us and the Bank. The amendments implement the \"Basel III\" regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The amended rules include new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective in January 2015, with certain requirements to be phased in beginning in 2016, and refined the definition of what constitutes \"capital\" for purposes of calculating those ratios.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements to us and the Bank could, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and/or additional capital conservation buffers could result in management modifying its business strategy and could further limit the Company's ability to make distributions, including paying out dividends or buying back shares.\nThe EGRRCPA directs the federal banking agencies to develop a specified Community Bank Leverage Ratio (that is, the ratio of a bank's equity capital to its consolidated assets) of not less than 8% and not more than 10%. On November 4, 2019, federal regulators issued final rules effective January 1, 2020 that provide certain banks and their holding companies with the option to elect out of complying with the Basel III Capital Rules. Under this new rule, a qualifying community banking organization is eligible to elect the community bank leverage ratio framework if it has a community bank leverage ratio, or CBLR, greater than 9% at the time of election. The final rule is described in more detail above under the section entitled \"Regulatory Capital Requirements.\" As of December 31, 2020, the Company and the Bank each qualified to elect the community bank leverage ratio framework because they had a CBLR of greater than 9% and satisfied the other requirements. Hawthorn has not opted in to CBLO. The Company does not have immediate plans to elect to use the community bank leverage ratio framework but may make such an election in the future. Under the CARES Act and regulations issued by federal banking agencies thereunder, effective October 1, 2020, the community bank leverage ratio has been temporarily reduced to 8% percent for 2020 and 8.5% for 2021 and is reset at 9% beginning January 1, 2022.\nNon-Compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Truth-in-Lending Act, Community Reinvestment Act, Fair Lending Laws Or Other Laws And Regulations Could Result In Fines Or Sanctions, And Curtail Expansion Opportunities. Financial institutions are required under the USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money-laundering and terrorist activities. Financial institutions are also obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network if such activities are detected. These rules also require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure or the inability to comply with the USA PATRIOT Act and Bank Secrecy Act statutes and regulations could result in fines or penalties, curtailment of expansion opportunities, enforcement actions, intervention or sanctions by regulators and costly litigation or expensive additional controls and systems. During the last few years, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. In addition, the U.S. Government imposed and will continue to expand laws and regulations relating to residential and consumer lending activities that create significant new compliance burdens and financial risks.\nWe are subject to a number of other laws and regulations, which may adversely affect the operation of our business and increase our costs. We are extensively regulated under U.S. federal and state law, and are subject to a number of laws and regulations in addition to banking laws and regulations, including securities, insurance and tax laws and regulations. As a company whose stock is publicly traded, we are subject to various federal and state securities laws, including the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and we file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, because our common stock is listed with The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, we are subject to the listing rules of that exchange. Our subsidiary, Hawthorn Risk Management, Inc., is subject to the regulations of the State of Missouri and undergoes periodic examinations by the Missouri Division of Finance. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to federal and state income taxes and Missouri franchise taxes, and are potentially subject to audits by the Internal Revenue Service and state income and franchise tax examinations by the Missouri Department of Revenue. Any failure by us to comply with any laws or regulations, any change in such laws or regulations or the position of any regulatory agency with respect thereto, or any adverse result in any regulatory investigation or examination, including any tax audit or examination, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTechnology and Vendor Risks\nWe Are Subject To Security And Operational Risks Relating To Our Use Of Technology That Could Damage Our Reputation And Our Business. We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Furthermore, we have access to large amounts of confidential financial information and control substantial financial assets, including those belonging to our customers, to whom we offer remote access, and we regularly transfer substantial financial assets by electronic means. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event, as well as from security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of our systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Although we intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent such damage, our security measures may not be successful.\nIn addition, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we and our third-party service providers use to encrypt and protect customer transaction data. A failure of such security measures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints caused by third parties that facilitate our business activities by providing technology such as software applications, as well as financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems, data or infrastructure.\nWe also face the potential risk of loss due to fraud, including commercial checking account fraud, automated teller machine (\"ATM\") skimming and trapping, write-offs necessitated by debit card fraud, and other forms of online banking fraud, which are becoming more sophisticated and present new challenges as mobile banking increases, as well as employee fraud. Employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence. We maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud. Should our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, and if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Operation Of Our Business, Including Our Interaction With Customers, Are Increasingly Done Via Electronic Means, And This Has Increased Our Risks Related To Cybersecurity. We rely on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems to conduct our business. This includes internally developed systems, the systems of third-party service providers, and digital and mobile technologies. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems, and could damage our reputation, result in loss of customer business, subject us to regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability. We are exposed to the risk of cyber-attacks in the normal course of business, which can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. We have observed an increased level of attention in the industry focused on cyber-attacks that include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyber-attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as by causing denial-of-service attacks on websites. Cyber-attacks\nmay be carried out by third parties or insiders using techniques that range from highly sophisticated efforts to electronically circumvent network security or overwhelm websites to more traditional intelligence gathering and social engineering aimed at obtaining information necessary to gain access. The objectives of cyber-attacks vary widely and can include theft of financial assets, intellectual property, or other sensitive information, including the information belonging to our banking customers. Cyber-attacks may also be directed at disrupting our operations.\nWe may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences if we fall victim to successful cyber-attacks. Such negative consequences could include remediation costs that may include liability for stolen assets or information and repairing system damage that may have been caused; increased cybersecurity protection costs that may include organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third party experts and consultants; lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack; litigation; and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence.\nWe Continually Encounter Technological Change, And We Cannot Predict How Changes In Technology Will Affect Our Business. The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven by products and services, which include developments in:\n\u2022telecommunications\n\u2022data processing\n\u2022automation\n\u2022internet-based banking\n\u2022telebanking\n\u2022debit cards and so-called \"smart cards\"\nThe effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe Rely On Others To Provide Key Components Of Our Business Infrastructure. Third party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections, network access and core application processing. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers or otherwise conduct our business efficiently and effectively. Replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe Price Of Our Common Stock Could Fluctuate Significantly, And This Could Make It Difficult For You To Resell Shares Of Our Common Stock At Times Or At Prices You Find Attractive. The stock market and, in particular, the market for financial institution stocks, has experienced significant volatility during the recent economic downturn. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices for certain issuers without regard to those issuers' underlying financial strength. As a result, the trading volume in our common stock could fluctuate more than usual and cause significant price variations to occur. This could make it difficult for you to resell shares of our common stock at times or at prices you find attractive.\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock will depend on many factors that could change from time to time and could be beyond our control. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are those identified under the heading \"Forward-Looking Statements\" in Item 7 of this report and as follows:\n\u2022actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our common stock or those of other financial institutions;\n\u2022failure to meet analysts' revenue or earnings estimates;\n\u2022speculation in the press or investment community generally or relating to our reputation, our market area, our competitors or the financial services industry in general;\n\u2022strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, restructurings, dispositions or financings;\n\u2022actions by our current stockholders, including sales of common stock by existing stockholders and/or directors and executive officers;\n\u2022fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;\n\u2022future sales of our equity, equity-related or debt securities;\n\u2022changes in the frequency or amount of dividends or share repurchases;\n\u2022proposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments;\n\u2022investigations, proceedings or litigation that involve or affect us;\n\u2022trading activities in our common stock, including short-selling;\n\u2022domestic and local economic factors unrelated to our performance; and\n\u2022general market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry.\nA significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for individual stockholders and could lead to costly and disruptive securities litigation.\nThe Trading Volume In Our Common Stock Has Been Low, And The Sale Of A Substantial Number Of Shares Of Our Common Stock In The Public Market Could Depress The Price Of Our Common Stock And Make It Difficult For You To Sell Your Shares. Our common stock is listed to trade on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, but is thinly traded. As a result, you may not be able to sell your shares of common stock on short notice. Additionally, thinly traded stock can be more volatile than stock trading in an active public market. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock at one time could temporarily depress the market price of our common stock, making it difficult for you to sell your shares and impairing our ability to raise capital.\nOur Common Stock Is Not Insured By Any Governmental Entity. Our common stock is not a deposit account or other obligation of any bank and is not insured by the FDIC or any other governmental entity.\nAdditional Factors. Additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of operations, financial condition or business of the Company and its banking subsidiary include, but are not limited to: (i) adverse publicity, news coverage by the media, or negative reports by brokerage firms, industry and financial analysts regarding the Bank or the Company; and (ii) changes in accounting policies and practices.", "PERMNO": 88341, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "HWBK"}
