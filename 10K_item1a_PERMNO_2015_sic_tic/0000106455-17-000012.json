{"cik": "106455", "company": "WESTMORELAND COAL Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A\n- RISK FACTORS.\nThis report, including Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation, contains forward-looking statements that may be materially affected by numerous risk factors, including, but not limited to, those summarized below.\nRisks Related to Restatement\nThe restatement of our previously issued financial statements contained in this Annual Report may lead to additional risks and uncertainties, including regulatory, shareholder or other actions, loss of investor confidence and negative impacts on our stock price.\nOur Audit Committee, after considering the recommendation of management, concluded that our previously issued consolidated financial statements should be restated for the reasons described in the Explanatory Note to this Form 10-K and Note 2 - Restatement Of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements to the consolidated financial statements and, accordingly, that such financial statements should no longer be relied upon. In this Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2016, we are restating: (i) our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 and our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, and statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014; and (ii) our unaudited quarterly financial information for 2016 and 2015. Restatement adjustments attributable to fiscal years 2003 through 2014 are reflected as a net adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2014.\nAs a result of this restatement and associated non-reliance on previously issued financial information, we have become subject to a number of additional costs and risks, including unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the restatement and the remediation of our ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. Likewise, the attention of our management team has been diverted by these efforts. In addition, we could also be subject to additional shareholder, governmental, regulatory or other actions or demands in connection with the restatement or other matters. Any such proceedings will, regardless of the outcome, consume a significant amount of management\u2019s time and attention and may result in additional legal, accounting, insurance and other costs. If we do not prevail in any such proceedings, we could be required to pay damages or settlement costs. In addition, the restatement and related matters could impair our reputation or could cause our customers, shareholders, or other counterparties to lose confidence in us. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal controls that, if not properly corrected, could result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nIn connection with the restatement of our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the unaudited quarterly financial data for all quarters within the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of February 24, 2017. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting that results in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Further, management determined that control deficiencies existed with respect to certain aspects of our historical financial reporting and, accordingly, management has concluded that management\u2019s reports related to the effectiveness of internal and disclosure controls may not have been correct. We did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 or 2014 as is set forth in Item 9A - Controls and Procedures of the Company\u2019s Annual Report.\nThe material weakness identified by management was due to the lack of operating effectiveness of our controls over the application of the asset retirement obligation accounting literature in instances where the company is reimbursed by its customers for final reclamation expenditures. As a result, reclamation receivables were recorded which should have been classified as an asset retirement cost and depleted on a units-of-production basis. The material weakness allowed errors to occur that were not detected in a timely manner therefore requiring a restatement of the financial statements discussed in the Explanatory Note to this Form 10-K and Note 2 - Restatement Of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements to the consolidated financial statements. The errors do not impact cash flows or liquidity for any previously issued financial statements.\nAs a result of the material weakness determination, and effective as of December 31, 2016, our management discontinued the previously used accounting policy and oversight method for reclamation receivables and implemented an approach prescribed by GAAP. Management further assigned personnel with the appropriate level of asset retirement obligation and technical accounting experience to review the accounting for asset retirement obligations. Accordingly, management does not expect the material weakness associated with this accounting policy to recur. If the changes in accounting\npolicy and oversight method do not remedy the control deficiencies and we are not able to otherwise remedy these control deficiencies in a timely manner, we may be unable to provide holders of our securities with the required financial information in a timely and reliable manner, either of which could subject us to litigation and regulatory enforcement actions.\nRisks Relating to our Business and Operations\nLong-term sales and revenues could be significantly affected by environmental regulations and the effects of the environmental lobby.\nEnvironmental regulations that had become increasingly stringent, as well as increased pressure from environmental activists, may reduce demand for our products. For example, a consortium of environmental activists is actively pushing to shut down one-third of the U.S. coal plants by 2020. They are taking particular interest in Colstrip Units 1 & 2 and are actively lobbying the EPA to require cost-prohibitive pollution control equipment. In litigation filed in 2012, the activists stated that the EPA\u2019s Best Available Retrofit Technology (\u201cBART\u201d) analysis for regional haze provides support for a determination that additional controls are necessary to achieve BART in the State of Montana. In June of 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that the EPA had failed to adequately explain its decision to require less stringent emission control technology for nitrogen oxides at Colstrip, and vacated the BART analysis and remanded it to the EPA for further proceedings. The EPA has not yet taken any action on a new regional haze plan. In 2013, environmental groups also filed a citizen suit complaint in Montana district court asserting that the owners and operators of Colstrip are in violation of Clean Air Act requirements. In July 2016, Colstrip owners entered into a settlement agreement with Sierra Club to dismiss the Clean Air Act violations in exchange for retirement of Units 1 and 2 no later than July 1, 2022. As a result of the settlement agreement, we expect to lose coal sales of approximately 2.3 million tons per year beginning the year of retirement. The loss of the sale of this tonnage at our Colstrip mine could have a material adverse effect on the mine\u2019s revenues and profitability.\nAdditionally, Rocky Mountain Power, the owner of the Naughton Power Station located adjacent to our Kemmerer mine, which is our Kemmerer mine\u2019s primary customer, has abandoned plans to convert Unit 3 at Naughton to 100% natural gas fueling. Instead, the owner has stated that it intends to retire Naughton Unit 3 at the end of 2017. This retirement will result in the loss of coal sales at our Kemmerer mine. However, Rocky Mountain Power stated that it will continue to consider potential alternatives to allow continued operation of Unit 3 beyond 2017. In addition, price protections built into the contract that are in effect from 2017 to 2021 will partially offset the effects of lowered volume. Despite these price protections, the lost sales at the Kemmerer mine could have a material adverse effect on the mine\u2019s revenues and profitability and on our operating results. Additional power plants that buy our coal may be considering or may consider in the future fuel source conversion or decreased operations in order to avoid costly upgrades of pollution control equipment, and such steps, if taken, could result in a reduced demand for our products and materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nIn May 2015, the EPA and the Corps issued a final rule to clarify which waters and wetlands are subject to regulation under the CWA. The implementation of this rule was stayed nationwide in October 2015. In January 2017, the Corps issued general nationwide permits for specific activities, including surface coal mining activities. Permitting challenges may increase if our activities do not qualify for nationwide permit coverage. A change in CWA jurisdiction and permitting requirements could increase or decrease our permitting and compliance costs.\nThe EPA has executed a final rule relating to the disposal of CCR from electric utilities. The changes to the management of CCR could increase our and our customers\u2019 operating costs and reduce sales of coal.\nIn December 2016, the OSM published the final Stream Protection Rule to reduce the environmental impact of surface coal mining operations. The rule included the expansion of baseline data requirements and post-mining restoration requirements. Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress approved H.J. Res. 38, disapproving the Stream Protection Rule. President Trump signed H.J. Res. 38 on February 16, 2017. The regulations in effect are those that were in place on January 18, 2017. OSM is in the process of developing a final rule for publication in the Federal Register to amend all the regulations altered by the Stream Protection Rule back to the form in which those regulations existed on January 18, 2017. If this rule is not amended, our permitting and compliance costs could increase.\nIn January 2016, the Federal Bureau of Land Management announced a moratorium on new coal leases on federal lands. The moratorium does not affect our existing federal leases. If the moratorium remains in force, it is unlikely to have a material impact on our ability to conduct future operations because we do not ordinarily bid on federal coal leases.\nWe are also affected by Canadian GHG emissions regulations. On September 12, 2012, the federal government of Canada released final regulations for reducing GHG emissions from coal-fired electricity generation: \u201cReduction of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Coal-Fired Generation of Electricity\u201d (the \u201cCanadian CO2 Regulations\u201d). The Canadian CO2\nRegulations required certain Canadian coal-fired electricity generating plants, effective July 1, 2015, to achieve an average annual emissions intensity performance standard of 463 tons of CO2 per gigawatt hour. The impact of the Canadian CO2 Regulations on existing plants will vary by province and specific location. The Canadian mines\u2019 long-term sales could be reduced unless certain existing plants that it supplies or new plants built to replace such existing plants are equipped with carbon capture and sequestration or other technology that achieves the prescribed performance standard, the impact of the Canadian CO2 Regulations is altered by equivalency agreements, or the Canadian CO2 Regulations are changed to lower the performance standard.\nIn addition, various Canadian provincial governments and other regional initiatives are moving ahead with GHG reduction and other initiatives designed to address climate change. As it is unclear at this time what shape additional regulation in Canada will ultimately take, it is not yet possible to reliably estimate the extent to which such regulations will impact the operations we acquired in our Canadian mines. However, our Canadian operations involve large facilities, so the setting of emissions targets (whether in the manner described above or otherwise) may well affect some or all of our Canadian customers, and may in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial performance. In addition to directly emitting GHGs, our Canadian operations require large quantities of power. Future taxes on or regulation of power producers or an increase in cost of the fuels used in power production (including coal, oil and gas or other products) may also add to our operating costs.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2016, we had a total outstanding indebtedness of approximately $1,147 million as detailed in Note 10 - Debt And Lines Of Credit to the consolidated financial statements. Our substantial amount of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;\n\u2022\nresult in an event of default if we fail to satisfy our obligations with respect to the 8.75% Notes, the Term Loan, the San Juan Loan, the Revolver or other debt or fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the 8.75% Notes, the Term Loan, the San Juan Loan, the Revolver Agreement or agreements governing our other indebtedness, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable and could permit our lenders to foreclose on our assets securing such debt or otherwise recover that debt from us;\n\u2022\nrequire a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the 8.75% Notes, the Term Loan, the San Juan Loan and the Revolver;\n\u2022\nincrease our cost of borrowing;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to service our indebtedness, including the 8.75% Notes, the Term Loan, San Juan Loan and the Revolver;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industry in which we operate, placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who therefore may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting; and\n\u2022\nprevent us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase all 8.75% Notes tendered to us upon the occurrence of certain changes of control, which failure to repurchase would constitute a default under the 8.75% Notes.\nThe occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and our ability to satisfy our obligations under the 8.75% Notes, the Term Loan, the San Juan Loan and the Revolver. In conjunction with our acquisition of the GP, WMLP entered into the WMLP Term Loan to refinance WMLP\u2019s indebtedness. Although the WMLP Term Loan is consolidated in our financial statements due to our ownership of the GP and controlling interest in WMLP, neither Westmoreland nor any of its restricted subsidiaries is obligors under the WMLP Term Loan and the loan will be non-recourse to Westmoreland and its wholly owned subsidiaries. If we further increase our indebtedness, the related risks that we now face, including those described above, could intensify.\nIf we fail to comply with certain covenants in our various debt arrangements, it could negatively affect our liquidity and ability to finance our operations.\nOur lending arrangements contain, among other terms, events of default and various affirmative and negative covenants, financial covenants and cross-default provisions. Should we be unable to comply with any future debt-related covenant, we will be required to seek a waiver of such covenant to avoid an event of default. Covenant waivers and modifications may be expensive to obtain, or, potentially, unavailable. If we are in breach of any covenant and are unable to obtain covenant waivers and our lenders accelerate our debt, we could attempt to refinance the debt or repay the debt by selling assets and applying the proceeds from such sales to the debt. Sales of assets undertaken in response to such immediate needs may be prohibited under our lending arrangements without the consent of our lenders, may be made at potentially unfavorable prices, or asset sales may not be sufficient to refinance or repay the debt, and we may be unable to complete such transactions in a timely manner, on favorable terms, or at all.\nAccess to our Revolver is dependent upon our compliance with certain financial ratio covenants. This includes a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 0.90 in certain quarters for both the US and Canada components of the Restricted Group and 1.10 for the Restricted Group on a consolidated basis. The fixed charge coverage ratio is generally calculated based on Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the debt agreement) divided by scheduled principal and interest payments for the most recently completed four quarters. At December 31, 2016 the US, Canada and consolidated Restricted Group fixed charge ratios were approximately 1.5, 1.1 and 1.25, respectively. Additionally, the San Juan Loan requires a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.05 The debt service coverage ratio is generally calculated as cash generated by the borrower and its subsidiaries divided by required debt service payments, including scheduled principal and interest payments. At December 31, 2016 the debt service coverage ratio was 1.13. Breaches of the Revolver financial covenants would cause a cross-default of the 8.75% Notes, the Term Loan and the San Juan Loan. Breaches of the San Juan Loan covenant would cause a cross-default of the 8.75% Notes and the Term Loan. Based on our quarterly projections, including the impact of lost or diminished coal sales at certain of our mines, we anticipate that we will maintain compliance with the financial covenants and have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations as they become due within one year after the date of the filing of our Annual Report.\nWe may not generate sufficient cash flow at our operating subsidiaries to pay our operating expenses, meet our debt service costs and pay our heritage and corporate costs.\nOur ability to fund our operations, to make scheduled payments on our indebtedness and comply with our financial covenants will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our historical financial results have been, and we expect our future financial results to be, subject to substantial fluctuations, and will depend upon general economic conditions and financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on the 8.75% Notes, the Term Loan, the San Juan Loan or our other debt or comply with the financial covenants associated with the Revolver and the San Juan Loan.\nIf our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations, to fund our other liquidity needs, or comply with our financial covenants, we may need to renegotiate our debt covenants, refinance all or a portion of our debt before maturity, seek additional equity capital, reduce or delay scheduled expansions and capital expenditures, or sell material assets or operations. We cannot assure you that we would be able to renegotiate our covenants, refinance or restructure our indebtedness, obtain equity capital, or sell assets or operations on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt instruments may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions.\nOur inability to take these actions and to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt covenants, debt service and other obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt or are not in compliance with our covenants and are not able to amend those covenants, we will be in default and holders of the 8.75% Notes and the lenders under the Term Loan, the San Juan Loan and the Revolver could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the Revolver could terminate their commitments to loan money to us, the holders of the 8.75% Notes and the lenders under the Term Loan, the San Juan Loan and the Revolver could foreclose on the assets securing our debt to them and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, we may need to seek amendments to our debt facilities to prevent us from potentially being in breach of our covenants. Such amendments, waivers or other modifications to our debt instruments may be expensive to obtain or potentially unavailable. If we are unable to obtain such an amendment, waiver or other modification, and our lenders accelerate our debt, we could attempt to refinance the debt or repay the debt by selling assets and applying the proceeds from such sales to the debt. Sales of assets undertaken in response to such immediate needs may be prohibited under our lending arrangements without the consent of our lenders, may be made at potentially unfavorable prices, or asset sales may not be sufficient to refinance or repay the debt, and we may be unable to complete such transactions in a timely manner, on favorable terms, or at all.\nAs a mine mouth operator, we provide coal to a small group of customers. This dependence could adversely affect our revenues if such customers reduce or suspend their coal purchases or if they become unable to pay for our coal.\nIn 2016, our Coal - U.S. segment derived approximately 83% of its total revenues from coal sales to five power plants: Public Service Company of New Mexico (28%); Colstrip Units 3&4 (22%); Colstrip Units 1&2 (12%), AEP (11%); and NRG Texas Power LLC (10%). Our Coal - Canada segment derived approximately 86% of its total revenues from coal sales to three customers: SaskPower (42%), the country of Japan (29%) and ATCO Power (15%). WMLP derived approximately 77% of its total coal revenues from sales to three customers: American Electric Power Company, Inc. (38%), Pacificorp Energy, Inc. (29%) and East Kentucky Power Cooperative (10%). Interruption in the purchases of coal by our principal customers could significantly affect our revenues.\nUnscheduled maintenance outages or other outages at our customers\u2019 power plants, unseasonably moderate weather, higher-than-anticipated hydro seasons or increases in the production of alternative clean-energy generation such as wind power, or decreases in the price of competing fossil fuels such as natural gas, could cause our customers to reduce their purchases. Sixteen of our 18 mines are dedicated to supplying customers located adjacent to or near the mines, and these mines may have difficulty identifying alternative purchasers of their coal if their existing customers suspend or terminate their purchases.\nCertain of our long-term contracts are set to expire in the next several years. Our contracts with the Sherburne County Station (i.e., Xcel Energy) are three-year rolling contracts, with one-third of the tonnage expiring on an annual basis. As of December 31, 2016, we have contracted tons through 2018. Our contract with Coyote Station, located adjacent to our Beulah mine and averaging approximately 2.5 million tons of coal sold per year, expired in May 2016. Our contract with NRG at Jewett expired two years early on December 31, 2016 (during 2016 we supplied NRG with 3.7 million tons), and our contract with Colstrip Units 1 & 2 will be terminated three years early in 2019 which equates to approximately 2.3 million tons annually and $10.7 million in operating income annually. Our contract with Colstrip Units 3 & 4 expires in December 2019. Should we be unable to successfully renew any or all of these expiring contracts, the reduction in the sale of our coal would adversely affect our operating results and liquidity and could result in significant impairments to the affected mine should the mine be unable to execute a new long-term coal supply agreement. The long term agreements we acquired or subsequently negotiated in connection with the mines we acquired in Canada have long-remaining terms. Coal supply agreements also typically contain force majeure provisions allowing temporary suspension of performance by us or the customer during the duration of specified events beyond the control of the affected party. Such agreements may also prohibit us from passing certain increased costs resulting from changes in regulations to our customers. Additionally, many of our coal supply agreements contain provisions allowing customers to suspend acceptance of coal shipments if coal delivered does not meet certain quality thresholds.\nSimilarly, interruption in the purchase of power by DNCP could also negatively affect our revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the sale of power by ROVA to DNCP accounted for approximately 6% of our consolidated revenues. Although ROVA supplies power to DNCP under long-term power purchase agreements, if DNCP is unable or unwilling to pay for the power produced by ROVA in a timely manner, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nPrice adjustment, \u201cprice re-opener\u201d and other similar provisions in WMLP\u2019s supply contracts may reduce the protection from short-term coal price volatility traditionally provided by such contracts. Price re-opener provisions typically require the parties to agree on a new price. Failure of the parties to agree on a price under a price re-opener provision can lead to termination of the contract. Any adjustment or renegotiations leading to a significantly lower contract price could adversely affect WMLP\u2019s business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nIn the absence of long-term contracts, WMLP\u2019s customers may decide to purchase fewer tons of coal than in the past or on different terms, including different pricing terms. Negotiations to extend existing contracts or enter into new long-term contracts with those and other customers may not be successful, which would negatively affect WMLP\u2019s ability to have sufficient cash to pay distributions and, in turn, would negatively affect our cash flow.\nOur hedging arrangement related to our ROVA facility may continue to result in losses when the market price for power drops below the level of our hedged position and, under certain circumstances, requires us to post additional collateral.\nThe Amending Agreement with respect to our ROVA facility permits Westmoreland Partners to\nmitigate its cash losses through the sale to DNCP of fixed-price purchased power. Based on current market pricing trends, we expect to experience losses from time to time under these hedging arrangements when the market price for power is not commensurate with our hedged position. Further, we are required to post collateral to cover certain projected long-term losses under these hedging arrangements based on the market price for power. The amount of such collateral may be significant and may negatively impact our liquidity.\nOur ability to collect payments from our customers could be impaired if their creditworthiness deteriorates.\nOur ability to receive payment for coal sold and delivered depends on the continued creditworthiness of our customers. If we determine that a customer is not creditworthy, we may not be required to deliver coal under the customer\u2019s coal sales contract. If this occurs, we may decide to sell the customer\u2019s coal on the spot market, which may be at prices lower than the contracted price, or we may be unable to sell the coal at all. Furthermore, the bankruptcy of any of our customers could materially and adversely affect our financial position. In addition, competition with other coal suppliers could cause us to extend credit to customers and on terms that could increase the risk of payment default.\nWMLP sells some of its coal to brokers who may resell its coal to end users, including utilities. These coal brokers may have only limited assets, making them less creditworthy than the end users. Under some of these arrangements, WMLP has contractual privity only with the brokers and may not be able to pursue claims against the end users. The bankruptcy or financial deterioration of any of WMLP\u2019s customers, whether an end user or a broker, could negatively affect WMLP\u2019s ability to have sufficient cash to pay distributions and, in turn, would negatively affect our cash flow.\nVolatility in the equity markets or interest rate fluctuations could substantially increase our pension funding requirements and negatively impact our financial position.\nThe difference between plan obligations and assets, or the funded status of the plans, significantly affects the net periodic benefit cost and ongoing funding requirements of those plans. Among other factors, changes in interest rates, mortality rates, early retirement rates, investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the level of plan funding, cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and increase our future funding requirements. See Note 12 - Pension And Other Saving Plans to the consolidated financial statements for the projected benefit obligation under our defined benefit pension plans at year end and the fair value of plan assets. This note also details our contributions to these pension plans and accrued expenses related thereto in the current year. The current economic environment increases the risk that we may be required to make even larger contributions in the future.\nIf our assumptions regarding our future expenses related to employee benefit plans are incorrect, then expenditures for these benefits could be materially higher than we have assumed. In addition, we may have exposure under those plans that extend beyond what our obligations would be with respect to our own employees.\nWe provide various postretirement medical benefits, black lung and workers\u2019 compensation benefits to current and former employees and their dependents. We calculate the total accumulated benefit obligations according to guidance provided by U.S. GAAP. We estimate the present value of our postretirement medical, black lung and workers\u2019 compensation benefit obligations to be $323.6 million, $17.6 million and $5.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016. Our Canadian operations have an obligation to provide postretirement health coverage for eligible current union employees, as described in greater detail below. We have estimated these unfunded obligations based on actuarial assumptions and if our assumptions do not materialize as expected, cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different.\nMoreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligations to provide these or additional benefits. We participate in defined benefit multi-employer funds that were established in connection with the Coal Act, which provides for the funding of health and death benefits for certain UMWA retirees. See Note 11 - Postretirement Medical Benefits to the consolidated financial statements for our contributions to these funds which could increase as a result of a shrinking contribution base due to the insolvency of other coal companies that currently contribute to these funds, lower than expected returns on fund assets or other funding deficiencies.\nWe could also have obligations under the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, (\u201c2006 Act\u201d). The 2006 Act authorized up to a maximum of $490 million in federal contributions to pay for certain benefits, including the healthcare costs under certain funds created by the Coal Act for \u201corphans,\u201d i.e. retirees from companies that subsequently ceased operations, and their dependents. However, if Congress were to amend or repeal the 2006 Act or if the $490 million authorization were insufficient to pay for these healthcare costs, we, along with other contributing employers and certain affiliates, would be responsible for the excess costs.\nWe also contribute to a multi-employer defined benefit pension plan, the Central Pension Fund of the Operating Engineers, (\u201cCentral Pension Fund\u201d) on behalf of employee groups at our Colstrip, Absaloka and Savage mines that are represented by the International Union of Operating Engineers (\u201cIUOE\u201d). The Central Pension Fund is subject to certain funding rules contained in the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (\u201cPPA\u201d). Under the PPA, if the Central Pension Plan fails to meet certain minimum funding requirements, it would be required to adopt a funding improvement plan or rehabilitation plan. If the Central Pension Fund adopted a funding improvement plan or rehabilitation plan, we could be required to contribute additional amounts to the fund. As of January 31, 2016, its last completed fiscal year, the Central Pension Fund reported that it was underfunded. If we were to partially or completely withdraw from the fund at a time when the Central Pension Fund was underfunded, we would be liable for a proportionate share of the fund\u2019s unfunded vested benefits, and this liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial position.\nOur Canadian operations have responsibility for obligations under certain pension plans related to certain of the acquired operations. We have evaluated these plans, and believe that certain of them may be underfunded by immaterial amounts. We are obligated to make contributions to these plans based upon agreement with the plan members and collective bargaining agreements with the representative unions. Our future contributions to these defined benefit plans are made in accordance with applicable pension legislation and the Income Tax Act (Canada). Further contributions to the pension plans could be required based on actuarial valuations, agreements, the plan asset investment performance, and future legislated requirements.\nUnder Canadian provincial Workers\u2019 Compensation legislation, we remain obligated to fund workers\u2019 compensation benefits arising from workplace injuries, disease and death of current and former employees. This obligation is based on premiums assessed by the applicable Workers\u2019 Compensation Board which may vary based on the claims experience of the employer. We may be required to contribute additional premiums in the future depending on the number and amount of claims.\nOur reserve estimates may prove to be incorrect.\nThe coal reserve estimates in this report are estimates based on the interpretation of limited sampling and subjective judgments regarding the grade, continuity and existence of mineralization, as well as the application of economic assumptions, including assumptions as to operating costs, foreign exchange rates and future commodity prices. The sampling, interpretations or assumptions underlying any reserve estimate may be incorrect, and the impact on the amount of reserves ultimately proven to be recoverable may be material. Should the mineralization and/or configuration of a deposit ultimately turn out to be significantly different from that currently envisaged, then the proposed mining plan may have to be altered in a way that could affect the tonnage and grade of the reserves mined and rates of production and, consequently, could adversely affect the profitability of the mining operations. In addition, short term operating factors relating to the reserves, such as the need for orderly development of ore bodies or the processing of new or different ores, may cause reserve estimates to be modified or operations to be unprofitable in any particular fiscal period. There can be no assurance that our projects or operations will be, or will continue to be, economically viable, that the indicated amount of minerals will be recovered or that they will be recovered at the prices assumed for purposes of estimating reserves.\nAny inaccuracies in our estimates of our coal reserves could result in decreased profitability from lower than expected revenues or higher than expected costs.\nOur future performance depends on, among other things, the accuracy of our estimates of our proven and probable coal reserves. Our reserve estimates are prepared by our engineers and geologists or by third-party engineering firms and are updated periodically. There are numerous factors and assumptions inherent in estimating the quantities and qualities of, and costs to mine, coal reserves, including many factors beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nquality of the coal and the percentage of coal ultimately recoverable;\n\u2022\ngeological and mining conditions, which may not be fully identified by available exploration data and/or may differ from our experiences in areas where we currently mine;\n\u2022\nthe assumed effects of regulation, including the issuance of required permits, taxes, including severance and excise taxes and royalties, and other payments to governmental agencies;\n\u2022\neconomic assumptions, including assumptions as to foreign exchange rates and future commodity prices;\n\u2022\nassumptions concerning the timing for the development of the reserves; and\n\u2022\nassumptions concerning equipment and productivity, future coal prices, operating costs, including for critical supplies such as fuel, tires and explosives, capital expenditures and development and reclamation costs.\nEstimates of the quantities and qualities of economically recoverable coal attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery, estimated cost of production, and estimates of future net cash flows expected from these properties may vary materially due to changes in the above factors and assumptions. Inaccuracies in our reserve estimates could result in decreased profitability from lower than expected revenues or higher than expected costs.\nIf the assumptions underlying our reclamation and mine closure obligations are materially inaccurate, we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated.\nWe are subject to stringent reclamation and closure standards for our mining operations. We calculated the total estimated reclamation and mine-closing liabilities according to the guidance provided by GAAP and current industry practice. Estimates of our total reclamation and mine-closing liabilities are based upon permit requirements and our engineering expertise related to these requirements. If our estimates are incorrect, we could be required in future periods to spend materially different amounts on reclamation and mine-closing activities than we currently estimate. Likewise, if our customers, some of whom are contractually obligated to pay certain reclamation costs, default on the unfunded portion of their contractual\nobligations to pay for reclamation, we could be forced to make these expenditures ourselves and the cost of reclamation could exceed any amount we might recover in litigation.\nSee Note 13 - Asset Retirement Obligations to the consolidated financial statements for our gross reclamation estimate and mine-closing liabilities which are based upon projected mine lives, current mine plans, permit requirements and our experience. The note details reclamation deposits held by us and received from customers to provide for these obligations. The note also shows our estimated obligation for final reclamation that was not the contractual responsibility of others or covered by offsetting reclamation deposits and how much we must recover from revenues to fund this deficit. Although we update our estimated costs annually, our recorded obligations may prove to be inadequate due to changes in legislation or standards and the emergence of new restoration techniques. Furthermore, the expected timing of expenditures could change significantly due to changes in commodity costs or prices that might curtail the life of an operation. These recorded obligations could prove insufficient compared to the actual cost of reclamation. Any underestimated or unidentified close down, restoration or environmental rehabilitation costs could have an adverse effect on our reputation as well as our asset values, results of operations and liquidity.\nIf the cost of obtaining new reclamation bonds and renewing existing reclamation bonds increases or if we are unable to obtain additional bonding capacity, our operating results could be negatively affected.\nWe are required to provide bonds to secure our obligations to reclaim lands used for mining. We must post a bond before we obtain a permit to mine any new area. These bonds are typically renewable on a yearly basis. Bonding companies are requiring that applicants collateralize increasing portions of their obligations to the bonding company. We anticipate that, as we permit additional areas for our mines, our bonding and collateral requirements could increase. Any cash that we provide to collateralize our obligations to our bonding companies is not available to support our other business activities. Our results of operations could be negatively affected if the cost of our reclamation bonding premiums and collateral requirements were to increase. Additionally, if we are unable to obtain additional bonding capacity due to cash flow constraints, we will be unable to begin mining operations in newly permitted areas which would hamper our ability to efficiently meet our current customer contract deliveries, expand operations, and increase revenues.\nOur coal mining operations are subject to external conditions that could disrupt operations and negatively affect our results of operations.\nWith the exception of the Buckingham and San Juan mines, our coal mining operations are all surface mines. These mines are subject to conditions or events beyond our control that could disrupt operations, affect production, and increase the cost of mining at particular mines for varying lengths of time. These conditions or events include: unplanned equipment failures; geological, hydrological or other conditions such as variations in the quality of the coal produced from a particular seam; variations in the thickness of coal seams and variations in the amounts of rock and other natural materials that overlie the coal that we are mining; weather conditions; and competition and/or conflicts with natural gas and other resource extraction activities and production within our operating areas. For example, we have endured poor rail performance at the Absaloka and Coal Valley mines, a major blizzard at the Beulah mine, a trestle fire at the Beulah mine, an unanticipated replacement of boom suspension cables on one of our draglines, all of which interrupted deliveries. Major disruptions in operations at any of our mines over a lengthy period could adversely affect the profitability of our mines.\nIn addition, unplanned outages of draglines and extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other problems occur from time-to-time and are an inherent risk of our coal mining business. Unplanned outages typically increase our operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce our revenues because of selling fewer tons of coal. As of December 31, 2016, 11 of our 29 owned or operated draglines were not in use due to either equipment servicing or because the dragline was scheduled to be down based on the operational needs of our mines. When properly maintained, a dragline can operate for 40 years or longer. As of December 31, 2016, the average age of Westmoreland\u2019s dragline fleet was 34 years. As our draglines, shovels and other major equipment age, we may experience unscheduled maintenance outages or increased maintenance costs, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nUnplanned outages and extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other problems occur from time to time at our power plant customers and are an inherent risk of our business. Unplanned outages typically increase our operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce our revenues because of selling fewer tons of coal. For example, the Conesville power plant, which is the largest customer of our Buckingham mine, experienced an unexpected shutdown in the first and second quarters of 2015. The plant was brought back into operation in the third quarter of 2015, but was subsequently taken back out of production to address vibration issues caused by a malfunctioning fan in one of the units. The Conesville plant ran at half its capacity until the necessary repairs were completed in early December 2015. We maintain business interruption insurance coverage at some of our mines to lessen the impact of events such as this. However, business interruption insurance may not always provide adequate compensation for lost coal sales, and significant unanticipated outages at our power plant customers which result in lost coal sales could result in significant adverse effects on our operating results. Additionally,\nour Beulah mine filed an intercompany business interruption claim with WRI, our captive insurance subsidiary, in the second quarter of 2015, which resulted in an increase in operating expenses in our Corporate segment.\nOur operations are vulnerable to natural disasters, operating difficulties and infrastructure constraints, not all of which are covered by insurance, which could have an impact on our productivity.\nMining and power operations are vulnerable to natural events, including blizzards, earthquakes, drought, floods, fire, storms and the possible effects of climate change. Operating difficulties such as unexpected geological variations could affect the costs and viability of our operations. Our operations also require reliable roads, rail networks, power sources and power transmission facilities, water supplies and IT systems to access and conduct operations. The availability and cost of infrastructure affects our capital expenditures, operating costs, and planned levels of production and sales.\nWe maintain insurance at levels we believe are appropriate and consistent with industry practice for some, but not all, of the potential risks and liabilities associated with our business; we are not fully insured against all risks. For some risks, we may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially, and in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. As a result, we may not be able to renew our existing insurance policies or procure other desirable insurance on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Pollution and environmental risks and consequences of any business interruptions such as equipment failure or labor disputes generally are not fully insurable. Losses and liabilities from uninsured and underinsured events and delay in the payment of insurance proceeds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMining at WMLP is more complex and involves more regulatory constraints than mining in other areas of the United States.\nThe geological characteristics of Northern Appalachian and Illinois Basin coal reserves, such as depth of overburden and coal seam thickness, make them complex and costly to mine. As WMLP\u2019s mines in these regions become depleted, replacement reserves may not be available when required or, if available, may not be capable of being mined at costs comparable to those of the depleting mines. These factors could adversely affect WMLP\u2019s business, financial condition and/or results of operations and its ability to make distributions to unit holders like us.\nA defect in title or the loss of a leasehold interest in certain property could limit our ability to mine our coal reserves or result in significant unanticipated costs.\nWe conduct a significant part of our coal mining operations on properties that we lease. A title defect or the loss of a lease could adversely affect our ability to mine the associated coal reserves. We may not verify title to our leased properties or associated coal reserves until we have committed to developing those properties or coal reserves. We may not commit to develop property or coal reserves until we have obtained necessary permits and completed exploration. As such, the title to property that we intend to lease or coal reserves that we intend to mine may contain defects prohibiting our ability to conduct mining operations. Similarly, our leasehold interests may be subject to superior property rights of other third parties. In order to conduct our mining operations on properties where these defects exist, we may incur unanticipated costs. In addition, some leases require us to produce a minimum quantity of coal and require us to pay minimum production royalties. Our inability to satisfy those requirements may cause the leasehold interest to terminate.\nWe are dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks.\nWe are dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure. Any significant breakdown, invasion, destruction or interruption of these systems by employees, others with authorized access to our systems, or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations. There is also a risk that we could experience a business interruption, theft of information, or reputational damage as a result of a cyber-attack, such as an infiltration of a data center, or data leakage of confidential information either internally or at our third-party providers. While we have invested in the protection of our data and information technology to reduce these risks and periodically test the security of our information systems network, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to continue acquiring and developing coal reserves that are economically recoverable and to raise the capital necessary to fund our expansion.\nOur reserves decline as we produce coal. We have not yet applied for the permits to use all of the coal deposits under our mineral rights, and the government agencies may not grant those permits in a timely manner or at all. Furthermore, we may not be able to mine all of our coal deposits as efficiently as we do at our current operations. Our future success depends upon conducting successful exploration and development activities and acquiring properties containing economically recoverable coal deposits. Our current strategy includes increasing our coal reserves through acquisitions of other mineral rights, leases, or producing properties and continuing to use our existing properties. Our ability to expand our operations may be dependent on our ability to obtain sufficient working capital, either through cash flows generated from operations, or financing activities, or both. As we mine our coal and deplete our existing reserves, replacement reserves may not be available when required or, if available, we may not be capable of mining the coal at costs comparable to those characteristic of the depleting mines. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our mining operations and costs, and our customers\u2019 ability to use the coal we mine.\nWe may not be able to successfully replace our reserves or grow through future acquisitions.\nIn recent years, we have expanded our operations by adding new mines and reserves through strategic acquisitions, and we intend to continue expanding our operations and coal reserves through additional future acquisitions. Our future growth could be limited if we are unable to continue making acquisitions, or if we are unable to successfully integrate the companies, businesses or properties we acquire. We may not be successful in consummating any acquisitions and the consequences of undertaking these acquisitions are unknown. Our ability to make acquisitions in the future could be limited by restrictions under our existing or future debt agreements, competition from other coal companies for attractive properties or the lack of suitable acquisition candidates.\nOur cash flow depends, in part, on the available cash and distributions of WMLP.\nWe expect our partnership interests in WMLP to be significant cash-generating assets. Therefore, our cash flow will be dependent, to some extent, upon the ability of WMLP to make quarterly distributions to its unitholders, including us. WMLP may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to enable it to pay distributions, which would have a corresponding negative impact on us. The amount of cash WMLP can distribute on its units principally depends upon the amount of cash it generates from its operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe domestic and foreign supply and demand for coal;\n\u2022\nthe quantity and quality of coal available from competitors;\n\u2022\nthe prices under WMLP\u2019s existing contracts where the pricing is tied to and adjusted periodically based on indices reflecting current market pricing;\n\u2022\ncompetition for production of electricity from non-coal sources, including the price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u2022\ndomestic air emission standards for coal-fueled power plants and the ability of coal-fueled power plants to meet these standards by installing scrubbers or other means;\n\u2022\nadverse weather, climate or other natural conditions, including natural disasters;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign taxes;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign economic conditions, including economic slowdowns;\n\u2022\nlegislative, regulatory and judicial developments, environmental regulatory changes or changes in energy policy and energy conservation measures that would adversely affect the coal industry, such as legislation limiting carbon emissions or providing for increased funding and incentives for alternative energy sources;\n\u2022\nthe proximity to, capacity of and cost of transportation and port facilities;\n\u2022\nmarket price fluctuations for sulfur dioxide emission allowances;\n\u2022\nthe level of capital expenditures it makes;\n\u2022\nthe cost of acquisitions;\n\u2022\nits debt service requirements and other liabilities;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in its working capital needs;\n\u2022\nits ability to borrow funds and access the capital markets;\n\u2022\nrestrictions contained in the debt agreements to which it is a party; and\n\u2022\nthe amount of cash reserves established by its general partner.\nAny adverse change in these and other factors could result in a decline in WMLP\u2019s ability to have sufficient cash to pay distributions and, in turn, would negatively affect our cash flow. WMLP distributions of cash largely ceased to us and are not expected to resume at significant levels for the foreseeable future.\nThe exchange of our Common Units in WMLP for Series B Units of WMLP will negatively affect our cash flow.\nSince acquiring the GP and a significant limited partner interest in WMLP, we have received quarterly cash distributions from WMLP. Our exchanging of 4,512,500 Common Units for the same amount of Series B Units, which are not entitled to receive such distributions, will cause us to forfeit cash distributions associated with the Common Units, resulting in a decrease of approximately $601,516 in quarterly cash flow based on WMLP\u2019s current quarterly distribution amount of $0.1333 per Common Unit. This negative impact to our cash flow could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations as a whole.\nThe conversion of Series B Units of WMLP back to Common Units in WMLP is anticipated to result in additional tax losses being allocated to us that may occur over multiple years.\nThe Series B Units are convertible on a one-for-one basis into Common Units on the day after the record date for a cash distribution on the Common Units in which WMLP is unable to make such a distribution without exceeding its restricted payment basket under the WMLP Term Loan Facility and the WMLP Revolving Credit Facility. The Series B Units will also convert automatically upon a change of control or a dissolution or liquidation of WMLP. Upon the conversion of Series B Units to Common Units, allocations of income, gain, loss or deduction will be made to cause the Common Units received to be fungible with the Common Units held by others. It is anticipated that this will result in an allocation of losses or deductions to WMLP. While the conversion of a Series B Unit occurs at a particular time, the allocations may occur over multiple years. If the allocations do not occur in the same year as the conversion, we will have fewer losses or deductions in that year than otherwise might be the case.\nOur tax position may be adversely affected by virtue of our interest in WMLP.\nOur investment in WMLP may adversely affect our tax position. Whether or not WMLP makes cash distributions to us, we will have income from our interest in WMLP, which may or may not be offset by deductions from WMLP and may or may not be sufficient to fund the taxes on such income. Further, if WMLP has taxable income, we may be allocated a significant portion of that taxable income. Additionally, if the Internal Revenue Service successfully contests the positions that WMLP takes, the results of that contest may result in additional taxable income being allocated to us. We could also be subject to additional taxation by individual states in which we do not conduct business or have assets due to our investment in WMLP.\nOur acquisition of the general partner of a publicly traded limited partnership may subject us to a greater risk of liability than ordinary business operations.\nWe own the general partner of WMLP, a publicly traded limited partnership. The general partner of WMLP may be deemed to have undertaken fiduciary obligations with respect to WMLP and its limited partners. Such fiduciary obligations may require a higher standard of conduct than ordinary business operations and, therefore, may involve a greater risk of liability, particularly when a conflict of interest is found to exist. Our control of the general partner of WMLP may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties, including claims brought due to conflicts of interest. Any liability resulting from such claims could be material.\nAlthough we control WMLP through our ownership of the GP, the GP owes fiduciary duties to WMLP\u2019s unitholders, which may conflict with the interests of our shareholders.\nConflicts of interest exist and may arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates, on the one hand, and WMLP and its limited partners, on the other hand. The directors and officers of the GP have fiduciary duties to manage WMLP in a manner beneficial to us, as the sole member of the GP. At the same time, the GP has fiduciary duties to manage the limited partnership in a manner beneficial to WMLP and its limited partners. The board of directors of the GP, and in certain cases the conflicts committee of the board, will resolve any such conflict and has broad latitude to consider the interests of all parties to the conflict. The resolution of these conflicts may not always be in our best interest. For example, conflicts of interest with WMLP may arise in the following situations:\n\u2022\nthe interpretation and enforcement of contractual obligations between us and our affiliates, on the one hand, and WMLP, on the other hand;\n\u2022\nthe determination of the amount of cash to be distributed to WMLP\u2019s limited partners and the amount of cash to be reserved for the future conduct of WMLP\u2019s business; and\n\u2022\nthe determination whether to make borrowings under the WMLP Revolver to pay distributions to its limited partners.\nIn addition, subject to certain conditions, the 8.75% Notes, the Term Loan, and the Revolver permit us to transfer certain assets, including in certain instances equity interests we hold in other entities, to WMLP and its subsidiaries. Provided that we comply with the applicable conditions, we may transfer a significant portion of our assets to WMLP and its\nsubsidiaries, which will not be restricted subsidiaries or guarantors under the 8.75% Notes, Term Loan or borrowers under the Revolver.\nBecause we own a controlling interest in WMLP, any internal control deficiencies at WMLP could impact our ability to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. The consummation of the WMLP transactions expanded Westmoreland by adding a significant subsidiary with separate financial reporting. The addition of WMLP\u2019s financial reporting may have adverse effects on our internal control over financial reporting.\nThe ongoing oversight of the operations of WMLP following the WMLP transactions could create additional risks to our disclosure controls that we may not foresee. WMLP is a separate, publicly traded master limited partnership, or MLP. However, due to our significant equity ownership in WMLP and ownership of the GP, we consolidate the results of WMLP in our public financial statements. To the extent WMLP\u2019s internal control systems are deficient, the integrity of our financial statements and results could be affected and we could fail to meet our regulatory reporting obligations in a timely manner, which ultimately could harm our operating results.\nTransportation impediments may hinder our current operations or future growth.\nCertain segments of our current business, principally our Absaloka mine and our Coal Valley mine rely on rail transportation for the delivery of coal product to customers and ports. Our ability to deliver our product in a timely manner could be adversely affected by the lack of adequate availability of rail capacity, whether because of work stoppages, union work rules, track conditions or otherwise. In 2011, flooding conditions disrupted rail service to the Absaloka mine, resulting in lost revenue. Rail or shipping transportation costs represent a significant portion of the total cost of coal for our customers, and the cost of transportation is a key factor in a customer\u2019s purchasing decision. In addition, the Coal Valley mine exports the majority of its production to the global seaborne market through a port facility in western Canada.\nThe unavailability of rail capacity and port capacity could also hinder our future growth as we seek to sell coal into new markets. The current availability of rail cars is limited and at times unavailable because of repairs or improvements, or because of priority transportation agreements with other customers. Port capacity is also restricted in certain markets. If transportation is restricted or is unavailable, we may be unable to sell into new markets and, therefore, the lack of rail or port capacity would hamper our future growth. We currently have sufficient committed port capacity to operate our export business, and additional port capacity is expected to be constructed in western Canada in the future. However, increases in transportation costs or the lack of sufficient rail or port capacity or availability could make our coal less competitive, or could result in coal becoming a less competitive source of energy in general, which could lead to reduced coal sales and/or reduced prices we receive for the coal. Our inability to timely deliver product or fuel switching due to rising transportation costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, WMLP depends upon barge, rail and truck systems to deliver coal to its customers. Disruptions in transportation services due to weather-related problems, mechanical difficulties, strikes, lockouts, bottlenecks, and other events could impair WMLP\u2019s ability to supply coal to its customers. In recent years, the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the State of West Virginia have increased enforcement of weight limits on coal trucks on their public roads. It is possible that all states in which WMLP\u2019s coal is transported by truck may modify their laws to limit truck weight limits. Such legislation and enforcement efforts could result in shipment delays and increased costs, which could have an adverse effect on WMLP\u2019s ability to increase or to maintain production and could adversely affect its revenues.\nDecreased availability or increased costs of key equipment and materials could impact our cost of production and decrease our profitability.\nWe depend on reliable supplies of mining equipment, replacement parts and materials such as explosives, diesel fuel, tires and magnetite. The supplier base providing mining materials and equipment has been relatively consistent in recent years, although there continues to be consolidation, which has resulted in a limited number of suppliers for certain types of equipment and supplies. Any significant reduction in availability or increase in cost of any mining equipment or key supplies could adversely affect our operations and increase our costs, which could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.\nIn addition, the prices we pay for these materials are strongly influenced by the global commodities market. Coal mines consume large quantities of commodities such as steel, copper, rubber products, explosives, diesel and other liquid fuels. Some materials, such as steel, are needed to comply with regulatory requirements. A rapid or significant increase in the cost of these commodities could increase our mining costs because we have limited ability to negotiate lower prices, and in some cases, do not have a ready substitute.\nOur long-term coal contracts are \u201ccost protected\u201d in that they typically contain either full pass-through of our costs or price escalation and adjustment provisions, pursuant to which the price for our coal may be periodically revised in line with broad economic indicators such as the Consumer Price Index, commodity-specific indices such as the PPI-light fuel oils index, and/or changes in our actual costs.\nWMLP enters into forward-purchase contract arrangements for a portion of its anticipated diesel fuel and explosive needs. Additionally, some of WMLP\u2019s expected diesel fuel requirements are protected, in varying amounts, by diesel fuel escalation provisions contained in coal supply contracts with some of its customers, that allow for a change in the price per coal ton sold. Price changes typically lag the changes in diesel fuel costs by one quarter. While WMLP\u2019s strategy provides it protection in the event of price increases to its diesel fuel, it may also prevent WMLP from the benefits of price decreases. If prices for diesel fuel decreased significantly below WMLP\u2019s forward-purchase contracts, it would lose the benefit of any such decrease.\nOur ability to acquire new permits and licenses in certain Canadian provinces may be affected by aboriginal rights.\nCanadian courts have recognized that aboriginal peoples may have rights with respect to land used or occupied by their ancestors in the absence of treaties to address those rights. These aboriginal rights may vary from limited rights of use for traditional purposes to rights of title and will depend upon, among other things, the nature and extent of prior aboriginal use and occupation. Aboriginal peoples may also have rights under applicable treaties for harvesting and ceremonial purposes on Crown lands or lands to which they have rights of access. The provincial governments of Alberta and Saskatchewan, as well as the Canadian government, are required to consult with aboriginal peoples with respect to the granting of and the issuance or amendment of project authorizations, including approvals, permits and licenses. These requirements may affect the ability of our Canadian operations to acquire new or amended operating approvals in these jurisdictions within a reasonable time frame, and may affect our development schedule and costs.\nUnion represented labor creates an increased risk of work stoppages and higher labor costs.\nAs of December 31, 2016, approximately 57% of our total workforce is represented by two labor unions, the IUOE and the UMWA. Our unionized workforce is spread out amongst the majority of our surface mines. As a majority of our workforce is unionized, there may be an increased risk of strikes and other labor disputes, and our ability to alter labor costs is subject to collective bargaining. Congress has proposed legislation to enact a law allowing workers to choose union representation solely by signing election cards, which would eliminate the use of secret ballots to elect union representation. While the impact is uncertain, if the government enacts this proposal into law, which would make it administratively easier to unionize, it may lead to more coal mines becoming unionized. While strikes are generally a force majeure event in long-term coal supply agreements, thereby exempting the mine from its delivery obligations, the loss of revenue for even a short time could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe face intense competition to attract and retain employees.\nWe are dependent on retaining existing employees and attracting additional qualified employees to meet current and future needs. We face intense competition for qualified employees, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such employees or that such competition among potential employers will not result in increasing salaries. We rely on employees with unique skill sets to perform our mining operations, including engineers, mechanics and other highly skilled individuals. An inability to retain existing employees or attract additional employees, especially with mining skills and background, could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of the acquisition of the Canadian mines, we are subject to foreign exchange risk as a result of exposures to changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. and Canada.\nAs a result of the acquisition of the Canadian mines, we face increased exposure to exchange rate fluctuations between the Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar. We realize a large portion of our revenues from sales made from the Canadian assets in Canadian dollars, and almost all of the expenses incurred by the Canadian assets are recognized in Canadian dollars. The exchange rate of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar has been at or near historic highs in recent years but throughout 2015 weakened considerably before improving slightly at the beginning of 2016 and then stabilizing at a relatively weak position for the remainder of 2016. If the weakening of the Canadian dollar in comparison to the U.S. dollar continues, earnings generated from our Canadian operations will translate into reduced earnings in our consolidated statements of operations reported in U.S. dollars. In addition, our Canadian entities record certain accounts receivable and accounts payable, which are denominated in Canadian dollars. Foreign currency transactional gains and losses are realized upon settlement of these assets and obligations.\nFluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations. For purposes of accounting, the assets and liabilities of our Canadian\noperations will be translated using period-end exchange rates, and the revenues and expenses of our Canadian operations will be translated using average exchange rates during each period. Translation gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders\u2019 equity.\nFederal legislation could result in higher healthcare costs.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \u201cPPACA\u201d) was enacted, impacting our costs of providing healthcare benefits to our eligible active employees, with both short-term and long-term implications. In the short term, our healthcare costs could increase due to, among other things, an increase in the maximum age for covered dependents to receive benefits, changes to benefits for occupational disease related illnesses, the elimination of lifetime dollar limits per covered individual and restrictions on annual dollar limits per covered individual. In the long term, our healthcare costs could increase for these same reasons, as well as due to an excise tax on \u201chigh cost\u201d plans, among other things. Implementation of this legislation is expected to extend through 2018. Beginning in 2018, the PPACA will impose a 40% excise tax on employers to the extent that the value of their healthcare plan coverage exceeds certain dollar thresholds. We anticipate that certain governmental agencies will provide additional regulations or interpretations concerning the application of this excise tax. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the PPACA, including any new regulations or interpretations, in future periods. Any increase in cost, as a result of legislation or otherwise, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nCertain federal income tax preferences currently available with respect to coal exploration and development may be eliminated in future legislation.\nThe U.S. federal government has proposed the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax preferences relating to coal exploration and development. The proposal would: (i) eliminate current deductions, the 60-month amortization period and the 10-year amortization period for exploration and development costs relating to coal and other hard mineral fossil fuels, (ii) repeal the percentage depletion allowance with respect to coal properties, (iii) repeal capital gains treatment of coal and lignite royalties and (iv) exclude from the definition of domestic production gross receipts all gross receipts derived from the production of coal and other hard mineral fossil fuels. The passage of any legislation effecting changes similar to those in the budget proposal in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to coal exploration and development, and any such change could increase our taxable income and negatively impact the value of an investment in our common stock.\nRisk Factors Relating to the Coal and Power Industries\nThe risk of prolonged recessionary conditions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we sell substantially all of our coal to electric utilities, our business and results of operations remain closely linked to demand for electricity. Recent economic uncertainty has raised the risk of prolonged recessionary conditions. Historically, global demand for basic inputs, including electricity production, has decreased during periods of economic downturn. If demand for electricity production decreases, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nCompetition in the North American coal industry may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nA few of our competitors in the North American coal industry are major coal producers who have significantly greater financial resources than we do. The intense competition among coal producers may impact our ability to retain or attract customers and may therefore adversely affect our future revenues and results of operations. Among other things, competitors could develop new mines that compete with our mines, have higher quality coal than our mines or build or obtain access to rail lines that would adversely affect the competitive position of our mines. The current restructuring of several North American coal producers may reduce our clarity into the competitive markets in which we sell coal for in the near term, and the long-term effect of such restructuring on our competitive position is unclear.\nAny change in consumption patterns by utilities away from the use of coal could affect our ability to sell the coal we produce or the prices that we receive.\nIn addition to competing with other coal producers, we compete generally with producers of other fuels. In 2016, the electric utility industry accounted for the majority of coal consumption in the U.S. and Canada. The demand for electricity, environmental and other governmental regulations, and the price and availability of competing fuels for power plants such as nuclear, hydro, natural gas and fuel oil as well as alternative sources of energy affects the amount of coal consumed by the electric utility industry. A decrease in coal consumption by the electric utility industry could adversely affect the demand for, and price of, coal, which could negatively impact our results of operations and liquidity. We do not have contracts guaranteeing the purchase of fixed quantities of coal, so revenue can fall even though we have long-term contracts.\nSome power plants are fueled by natural gas because of the relatively lower construction costs of such plants compared to coal-fired plants and because natural gas is a cleaner burning fuel. In addition, some states have adopted or are considering legislation that encourages domestic electric utilities to switch from coal-fired power generation plants to natural gas powered plants. Similar legislation has been implemented or is under consideration in several Canadian provinces. Passage of these and other state, provincial or federal laws or regulations limiting carbon dioxide emissions could result in fuel switching, from coal to other fuel sources, by purchasers of our coal. Such laws and regulations could also mandate decreases in carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants, impose taxes on carbon emissions or require certain technology to capture and sequester carbon dioxide from coal-fired power plants. If these or similar measures are ultimately imposed by federal, state or provincial governments or pursuant to international treaty, our reserves and operating costs may be materially and adversely affected. Similarly, alternative fuels (non-fossil fuels) could become more attractive than coal in order to reduce carbon emissions, which could result in a reduction in the demand for coal and, therefore, our revenues.\nRecently, the supply of natural gas has reached record highs and the price of natural gas has remained at depressed levels for sustained periods due to extraction techniques involving horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing that have led to economic access to large quantities of natural gas in the United States and Canada, making it an attractive competing fuel. A continuing decline in the price of natural gas, or continuing periods of sustained low natural gas prices, could cause demand for coal to decrease, result in fuel switching and decreased coal consumption by electricity-generating utilities and adversely affect the price of our coal. Sustained low natural gas prices may cause utilities to phase-out or close existing coal-fired power plants or reduce construction of any new coal-fired power plants, which could have a material adverse effect on demand and prices received for our coal.\nChanges in the export and import markets for coal products could affect the demand for our coal, our pricing and our profitability.\nAlthough our mines and the majority of our customers are located in North America, we compete in a worldwide market for coal and coal products. The pricing and demand for our products is affected by a number of global economic factors that are beyond our control and difficult to predict. These factors include:\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rates;\n\u2022\ngrowth of economic development;\n\u2022\nprice of alternative sources of electricity or steel;\n\u2022\nworldwide demand for coal and other sources of energy; and\n\u2022\nocean freight rates.\nAny decrease in the aggregate amount of coal exported from the United States and Canada, or any increase in the aggregate amount of coal imported into the United States and Canada, could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our coal, our pricing and our profitability. Ongoing uncertainty in European economies and slowing economies in China, India and Brazil have reduced and may continue to reduce near-term pricing and demand for coal exported from the United States and Canada. The Coal Valley mine primarily supplies premium thermal coal to the Asian export market. Ownership of this mine will increase our exposure to price fluctuations in the international coal market, and a substantial downturn in demand in the Asian market could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nExtensive government regulations impose significant costs on our mining operations, and future regulations could increase those costs or limit our ability to produce and sell coal.\nThe coal mining industry is subject to increasingly strict regulation by federal, state and local authorities with respect to matters such as:\n\u2022\nlimitations on land use;\n\u2022\nemployee health and safety;\n\u2022\nmandated benefits for retired coal miners;\n\u2022\nmine permitting and licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nreclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed;\n\u2022\nair quality standards;\n\u2022\ndischarges to water;\n\u2022\nconstruction and permitting of facilities required for mining operations, including valley fills and other structures constructed in water bodies and wetlands;\n\u2022\nprotection of human health, plant life and wildlife;\n\u2022\nmanagement of the materials generated by mining operations and discharge of these materials into the environment;\n\u2022\neffects of mining on groundwater quality and availability; and\n\u2022\nremediation of contaminated soil, surface and groundwater.\nWe are required to prepare and present to governmental authorities data concerning the potential effects of any proposed exploration or production of coal on the environment and the public has statutory rights to submit objections to requested permits and approvals. Failure to comply with MSHA regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Other governmental agencies may impose cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, issue injunctions to limit or cease operations, suspend or revoke permits and take other enforcement measures that could have the effect of limiting production from our operations. We may also incur costs and liabilities resulting from claims for damages to property or injury to persons arising from our operations. We must compensate employees for work-related injuries. If we do not make adequate provision for our workers\u2019 compensation liabilities, it could harm our future operating results. If we are pursued for any sanctions, costs and liabilities, our mining operations and, as a result, our results of operations, could be adversely affected.\nUnited States and Canadian federal, state or provincial regulatory agencies have the authority to temporarily or permanently close a mine following significant health and safety incidents, such as a fatality. In the event that these agencies order the closing of our mines, our coal sales contracts may permit us to issue force majeure notices which suspend our obligations to deliver coal under these contracts. However, our customers may challenge our issuances of force majeure notices. If these challenges are successful, we may have to purchase coal from third-party sources, if it is available, and potentially at prices higher than our cost to produce coal, to fulfill these obligations, and negotiate settlements with customers, which may include price and quantity reductions, the extension of time for delivery, or contract termination. Additionally, we may be required to incur capital expenditures to re-open the mine. These actions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nNew legislation or regulations and orders may be adopted that may materially adversely affect our mining operations, our cost structure or our customers\u2019 ability to use coal. New legislation or administrative regulations (or new judicial interpretations or administrative enforcement of existing laws and regulations), including proposals related to the protection of the environment that would further regulate and tax the coal industry, may also require us or our customers to change operations significantly or incur increased costs. These regulations, if proposed and enacted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For additional information regarding specific regulations that impact our operations, see Item 1 - Business - Material Effects of Regulation.\nConcerns regarding climate change are, in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate, leading to increasing interest and in some cases enactment of, laws and regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions, which affect the end-users of coal and could reduce the demand for coal as a fuel source and cause the volume of our sales and/or the prices we receive to decline. These laws and regulations also have imposed, and will continue to impose, costs directly on us.\nGHG emissions have increasingly become the subject of international, national, state, provincial and local attention. Coal-fired power plants can generate large amounts of GHG emissions. Accordingly, legislation or regulation intended to limit GHGs will likely indirectly affect our coal operations by limiting our customers\u2019 demand for our products or reducing the prices we can obtain, and also may directly affect our own power operations. In the United States, the EPA, acting under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act has promulgated GHG-related reporting and permitting rules. Portions of the EPA\u2019s GHG permitting rules, which were the subject of litigation by some industry groups and states, were struck down in part by the U.S. Supreme Court, but the EPA\u2019s authority to impose GHG control technologies on a majority of large emissions sources, including coal-fired electric utilities, remain in place. In furtherance of President Obama\u2019s Climate Action Plan announced in June 2013, the EPA issued in August 2015 final standards for GHG emissions from existing fossil-fuel fired power plants, as well as new, modified and reconstructed fossil-fuel fired power plants. The Clean Power Plan sets standards\nfor existing sources as stringent state-specific carbon emission rates to be phased in between 2020 and 2030. The rule would give states the discretion to use a variety of approaches - including cap-and-trade programs - to meet the standard. In February of 2016, however, the Supreme Court issued an order staying the Clean Power Plan pending judicial review of the rule by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit as well as potential review by the Supreme Court. The D.C. Circuit issued an expedited briefing schedule for challenges to the rule, and an en banc court heard oral argument on September 27, 2016. However, the Trump Administration has indicated that it plans to repeal the rule and it is uncertain whether it will be replaced. The U.S. Congress has considered, and in the future may again consider, legislation governing GHG emission, including \u201ccap and trade\u201d legislation that would establish a cap on emissions of GHGs covering much of the economy in the United States and would require most sources of GHG emissions to obtain GHG emission \u201callowances\u201d corresponding to their annual emissions of GHGs. In addition, coal-fired power plants, including new coal-fired power plants or capacity expansions of existing plants, have become subject to opposition by environmental groups seeking to curb the environmental effects of GHG emissions. It is difficult to predict at this time the effect these rules would have on our revenues and profitability. For additional information, see Item 1 - Business - Material Effects of Regulation - U.S. Regulation.\nIn Canada, in September 2012 the federal government released final regulations for reducing GHG emissions from coal-fired electricity generation through the Canadian CO2 Regulations. The Canadian CO2 Regulations required certain Canadian coal-fired electricity generating units, effective July 1, 2015, to achieve an average annual emissions intensity performance standard of 463 tons of CO2 per gigawatt hour. The performance standard applies to new units commissioned after July 1, 2015 and to units that are considered to have reached the end of their useful life at 50 years from the unit\u2019s commissioning date. All of the customer generating assets currently served by our Canadian mines have annual average CO2 emissions intensity greater than the performance standard other than one of the units at SaskPower\u2019s Boundary Dam Generating Station, which incorporates carbon capture and sequestration technology. New and end-of-life units that incorporate technology for carbon capture and sequestration may apply for a temporary exemption from the performance standard that would remain in effect until 2025, provided that certain implementation milestones are met. Provincial equivalency agreements, under which the Canadian CO2 Regulations would stand down, are being negotiated or discussed with the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. The Canadian coal production in the long-term could be reduced unless certain existing units or new units of the customers served by the Canadian mines are equipped with carbon capture and storage or other technology that achieves the prescribed performance standard, the impact of the Canadian CO2 Regulations is altered by equivalency agreements, or the Canadian CO2 Regulations are changed to lower the performance standard. The impact of the Canadian CO2 Regulations on existing units will vary by location and province.\nVarious Canadian provincial governments and other regional initiatives are moving ahead with GHG reduction and other initiatives designed to address climate change. For example, under the Climate Change and Emissions Management Act, the Province of Alberta enacted the \u201cSpecified Gas Emitters Regulation.\u201d As of January 1, 2008, this enactment requires certain existing facilities with direct emissions of 100,000 metric tons or more of certain specified gases to ensure that the net emissions intensity for a year for an established facility must not exceed 88% of the baseline emissions intensity for the facility. For the 2013 and 2014 compliance periods, Coal Valley mine exceeded 88% of its baseline emissions and was required to contribute to the Climate Change and Emissions Management Fund by purchasing fund credits. For the 2016 compliance period, the preliminary calculations indicate Coal Valley mine will not be required to purchase fund credits and could earn fund credits for future use by coming in under 88% of its baseline emissions. It is also anticipated that emissions intensity at Coal Valley mine will be such that fund credits for future use will be earned, and fund credits will not be required to be purchased. The Government of Alberta has also introduced a complementary Specified Gas Reporting Regulation, which came into force on October 20, 2004. This legislation requires all industrial emitters emitting 50,000 tons or more of CO2 to report their annual GHG emissions in accordance with the specified Gas Reporting Standard published by the Government of Alberta. In Saskatchewan, Bill 126, The Management and Reduction of Greenhouse Gases Act, was passed in 2010 but is not yet proclaimed in force. The legislation provides a framework for the control of GHG emissions by regulated emitters and will be proclaimed once accompanying draft regulations are finalized. In Alberta, the Government commissioned the Alberta Climate Leadership Panel to make policy recommendations for Alberta to enact to combat climate change. On November 20th, 2015, the Alberta Climate Leadership Panel published a report entailing policy recommendations including the shutdown of coal-fired power generation by the year 2030 and changes to the SGE Regulation that would see costs of emissions to large emitters increase as early as 2017. The Government of Alberta has not yet presented legislation related to combating climate change, but the Premier in a press conference has indicated that they will be implementing the shutdown and SGE Regulation changes proposed by the Alberta Climate Leadership Panel. The full effects of any new legislation is unknown until draft legislation is presented by the Alberta Government. See Item 1 - Business - Material Effects of Regulation - Canadian Regulation.\nAs it is unclear at this time what shape additional regulation in Canada will ultimately take, it is not yet possible to estimate the extent to which such regulations will impact our Canadian Operations. However, those operations involve large facilities, so the setting of emissions targets (whether in the manner described above or otherwise) may well affect them and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial performance. These developments in\nboth Canada and the United States could have a variety of adverse effects on demand for the coal we produce. For example, laws or regulations regarding GHGs could result in fuel switching from coal to other fuel sources by electricity generators, or require us, or our customers, to employ expensive technology to capture and sequester carbon dioxide. Political and environmental opposition to capital expenditure for coal-fired facilities could affect the regulatory approval required for the retrofitting of existing power plants.\nPolitical opposition to the development of new coal-fired power plants, or regulatory uncertainty regarding future emissions controls, may result in fewer such plants being built, which would limit our ability to grow in the future.\nIn addition to directly emitting GHGs, our Canadian Operations require large quantities of power. Future taxes on or regulation of power producers or the production of coal, oil and gas or other products may also add to our operating costs. The policy recommendations put forward by the Alberta Climate Leadership Panel, if enacted, have the potential to increase costs of energy products used in the mine operations located in Alberta, such as diesel fuel, gasoline, oil, and electricity.\nMany of the developments in the U.S. discussed above that may affect our customers and demand for our coal could also affect us directly through adverse impacts on ROVA.\nAn inability to obtain and/or renew permits necessary for WMLP\u2019s operations could prevent it from mining certain of its coal reserves.\nThe slowing pace at which permits are issued or renewed for new and existing mines in WMLP\u2019s area of operations has materially impacted production in Appalachia. Section 402 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits and Section 404 CWA permits are required to discharge wastewater and dredged or fill material into waters of the United States. WMLP\u2019s surface coal mining operations typically require such permits to authorize activities such as the creation of sediment ponds and the reconstruction of streams and wetlands impacted by its mining operations. Although the CWA gives the EPA a limited oversight role in the Section 404 permitting program, the EPA has recently asserted its authorities more forcefully to question, delay, and prevent issuance of some Section 404 permits for surface coal mining in Appalachia. Currently, significant uncertainty exists regarding the obtaining of permits under the CWA for coal mining operations in Appalachia due to various initiatives launched by the EPA regarding these permits, including the issuance in May 2015 of a final rule revising the definition of regulated waters and the issuance of the Stream Protection Rule by the OSM in December 2016. An inability to obtain the necessary permits to conduct WMLP\u2019s mining operations or an inability to comply with the requirements of applicable permits could reduce WMLP\u2019s production and cash flows, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and/or results of operations and our cash flow.\nExtensive environmental laws, including existing and potential future legislation, treaties and regulatory requirements relating to air emissions other than GHGs, affect our customers and could reduce the demand for coal as a fuel source and cause coal prices and sales of our coal to materially decline, and could impose additional costs on ROVA.\nOur customers, as well as ROVA, are subject to extensive environmental regulations particularly with respect to air emissions other than GHG. Coal contains impurities, including but not limited to sulfur, mercury, chlorine and other elements or compounds, many of which are released into the air when coal is burned. The emission of these and other substances is extensively regulated at the federal, state, provincial and local level, and these regulations significantly affect our customers\u2019 ability to use the coal we produce and, therefore, the demand for that coal. The EPA intends to issue or has issued a number of significant regulations that will impose more stringent requirements relating to air, water and waste controls on electric generating units. These rules include the EPA\u2019s final rule for CCR management, announced in December 2014, that further regulates the handling of wastes from the combustion of coal. In April 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the EPA\u2019s Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, which would require stringent reductions in emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide from power plants in much of the U.S. For more details, see Item 1 - Business - Material Effects of Regulation - Mercury Air Standards and Clean Air Interstate Rule and Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (\u201cCAIR\u201d) and Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. In May 2014, the EPA Administrator signed a final rule that establishes requirements for cooling water intake structures for the withdrawal of cooling water by electric generating plants; the rule is anticipated to affect over 500 power plants.\nConsiderable uncertainty is associated with air emissions initiatives, and it is unclear how the Trump Administration will approach both previous rules and new rulemakings. New regulations are in the process of being developed, and many existing and potential regulatory initiatives are subject to review by federal or state agencies or the courts. Stringent air emissions limitations are already in place, and these limitations will likely require significant emissions control expenditures for many coal-fired power plants. For example, the owners of Units 3 & 4, adjacent to our Colstrip mine, are getting considerable pressure from environmental groups to install Selective Catalytic Reduction (\u201cSCR\u201d) technology. Should the owners be forced by the EPA to install such technology, the capital requirements could make the continued operation of the two units unsustainable. As a result, Colstrip and other similarly-situated power plants may switch to other fuels that generate fewer of these emissions or may install more effective pollution control equipment that reduces the need for low-sulfur coal. Any\nswitching of fuel sources away from coal, closure of existing coal-fired power plants, or reduced construction of new coal-fired power plants could have a material adverse effect on demand for, and prices received for, our coal. Alternatively, less stringent air emissions limitations, particularly related to sulfur, to the extent enacted, could make low-sulfur coal less attractive, which could also have a material adverse effect on the demand for, and prices received for, our coal.\nThe regulation of air emissions in Canada may also reduce the demand for the products of the operations we acquired in the acquisition of the Canadian mines. Specifically, the Alberta Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act (\u201cEPEA\u201d) and its Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (\u201cCEPA, 1999\u201d) and the provision for the reporting of pollutants via the National Pollutant Release Inventory (\u201cNPRI\u201d), could also have a significant effect on the customers of our Canadian mines, which in turn could, over time, significantly reduce the demand for the coal produced from those mines.\nThe customers of our Canadian mines must comply with a variety of environmental laws that regulate and restrict air emissions, including the EPEA and its regulations, and the CEPA, 1999. Because many of these customers\u2019 activities generate air emissions from various sources, compliance with these laws requires our customers in Canada to make investments in pollution control equipment and to report to the relevant government authorities if any emissions limits are exceeded or are made in contravention of the applicable regulatory requirements.\nThese laws restrict the amount of pollutants that our Canadian customer\u2019s facilities can emit or discharge into the environment. The NPRI, for example, is created under authority of the CEPA, 1999 and is a Canada-wide, legislated, and publicly accessible inventory of specific substances that are released into the air, water, and land. The purpose of the NPRI was to provide comprehensive national data on releases of specified substances, and assists with, identifying priorities for action, encouraging voluntary action to reduce releases, tracking the progress of reductions in releases, improving public awareness and understanding of substances released into the environment, and supporting targeted initiatives for regulating the release of substances.\nRegulatory authorities can enforce these and other environmental laws through administrative orders to control, prevent or stop a certain activity; administrative penalties for violating certain environmental laws; and judicial proceedings. If environmental regulatory burdens continue to increase for our Canadian customers, as a result of policy changes or increased regulatory reform relating to the substances reported, it could potentially affect customer operations and demand for coal.\nRisk Factors Relating to our Equity\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent a change of control of our company that stockholders may consider favorable, and the market price of our common stock may be lower as a result.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders. Provisions of our bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements that could make it more difficult for stockholders to bring about some types of corporate actions such as electing individuals to the board of directors. Our ability to issue preferred stock in the future may influence the willingness of an investor to seek to acquire our company. These provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. Provisions in the indenture governing the 8.75% Notes regarding certain change of control events could have a similar effect.\nRisks Related to Acquisitions\nThe assets we acquired in the San Juan Acquisition may underperform relative to our expectations; the San Juan Acquisition may cause our financial results to differ from our expectations or the expectations of the investment community; and we may not be able to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated objectives.\nThe success of the San Juan Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the San Juan Entities with our existing business. The integration process may be complex, costly and time consuming. The potential difficulties of integrating the San Juan Entities and realizing our expectations for the San Juan Acquisition include, among other things:\n\u2022\nfailure to implement our strategy for the development of the acquired assets;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in commodity prices;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nretaining and obtaining required regulatory approvals, licenses and permits;\n\u2022\noperating risks inherent in our business; and\n\u2022\nother unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities.\nMany of these factors will be outside of our control, and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even if our operations and the acquired assets are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of the San Juan Acquisition, including the synergies or cost savings that we expect. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. As a result, we cannot assure you that the San Juan Acquisition will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated.\nSJGS, San Juan\u2019s primary customer, is required to shut down half of its power producing units at the end of 2017, which we expect will result in a significant decrease in SJGS\u2019s demand for coal produced by the San Juan mine.\nOn October 1, 2014, SJGS reached an agreement with the New Mexico agencies, non-governmental organizations, and the EPA to shut down two of its power generating units by December 31, 2017 to comply with requirements under the Clean Air Act. Under the same agreement, SJGS also agreed to install selective non-catalytic reduction (\u201cSNCR\u201d) emission control technology on its two units that will remain active, with the deadline for that installation at the end of 2016. Following the shutdown of the units, four of SJGS\u2019s nine owning utilities will cease ownership, with PSNM and Tucson Electric expected to remain as the primary customers of the station. In August 2015, the parties agreed to modifications to the original agreement. The modifications did not alter provisions requiring installation of SNCR or shut down of two of the units, but it did include a commitment by PSNM to make a filing before the New Mexico PRC demonstrating the ongoing economic viability of SJGS beyond 2022. This agreement has not yet been approved by the New Mexico PRC. As a result of these developments, we expect that SJGS\u2019s demand for coal produced by the San Juan mine will decrease significantly, which will negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition unless we are able to find a suitable alternative customer for the coal produced by the San Juan mine. Because the San Juan mine is a mine-mouth facility, we may have difficulty identifying customers.\nSJCC is subject to pending litigation that could result in the temporary interruption of its mining operations.\nSJCC is subject to certain litigation related to its operations, including an Action filed by WildEarth Guardians (\u201cWEG\u201d) on February 27, 2013, in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado seeking review of the Office of Surface Mining (\u201cOSM\u201d) decisions and decisions of the Assistant Secretary of the Interior approving mine plans or mine plan amendments concerning seven separate coal mines in Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, and Wyoming. Among the decisions being challenged is the January 2008 approval of the mining plan modification for the San Juan mine. WEG alleges that in approving the plans or plan amendments, OSM engaged in a \u201cpattern and practice of failing to comply with\u201d the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act by failing \u201cto ensure that the public was appropriately involved in the adoption of\u201d the mine plans and by failing to \u201ctake a hard look at a number of potentially significant environmental impacts.\u201d On February 7, 2014, the case was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico. On March 14, 2014, WEG filed an amended petition. Settlement discussions among the parties are ongoing and no trial date has been scheduled. In the event the parties reach a settlement or litigation proceeds and WEG prevails in the case, there is the potential that San Juan would be required to cease mining activities, pending OSM\u2019s completion of a supplemental environmental impact analysis that supports the Assistant Secretary of the Interior\u2019s approval of the mining plan modification for the San Juan mine in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act. Any such interruption of mining activities at San Juan could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not have uncovered all risks associated with our recent acquisition activity, and significant liabilities related to such activity of which we are not aware may exist now or arise in the future.\nIn connection with the acquisitions of San Juan, Buckingham, WMLP and Canadian mines, we assumed the risk of unknown, and certain known, liabilities. We may become responsible for unexpected liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence in connection with these acquisitions or for costs associated with known liabilities that exceed our estimates. Under the various purchase arrangements relating to these acquisitions, there may not be recourse to indemnification should we discover a previously unknown liability, whether material or immaterial.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of recent or future acquisitions, potential synergies, due to challenges associated with integration and other factors.\nThe long-term success of the acquisitions will depend in part on the success of our management in efficiently integrating the operations, technologies and personnel acquired entities or operations. Our management\u2019s inability to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating acquired entities or operations or to otherwise realizing the anticipated benefits of such transactions could harm our results of operations.\nThe challenges involved in integration include:\n\u2022\nintegrating the operations, processes, people and technologies;\n\u2022\ncoordinating and integrating regulatory, benefits, operations and development functions;\n\u2022\ndemonstrating to customers acquisition will not result in adverse changes in coal quality, delivery schedules and other relevant deliverables;\n\u2022\nmanaging and overcoming the unique characteristics of acquired entities or operations, such as the specific mining conditions at each of the acquired mines; retaining the personnel of acquired entities or operations and integrating the business cultures, operations, systems and clients of acquired entities or operations with our own;\n\u2022\nconsolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations and functions; and\n\u2022\nidentifying the potential unknown liabilities associated with these acquisitions.\nIn addition, overall integration will require substantial attention from our management, particularly in light of the geographically dispersed operations of acquired mines relative to our other mines and operations and the unique characteristics of the acquired assets. If our senior management team is required to devote considerable amounts of time to the integration process, it will decrease the time they will have to manage our business, develop new strategies and grow our business. If our senior management is not able to manage the integration process effectively, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer.\nFurthermore, the anticipated benefits and synergies of acquisitions are based on assumptions and current expectations, with limited actual experience, and assume that we will successfully integrate and reallocate resources without unanticipated costs and that our efforts will not have unforeseen or unintended consequences. In addition, our ability to realize the benefits and synergies of the acquisitions could be adversely impacted to the extent that relationships with existing or potential customers, suppliers or the workforce is adversely affected as a consequence of these acquisitions, as a result of further weakening of global economic conditions, or by practical or legal constraints on our ability to successfully integrate operations.\nWe cannot assure you that we will successfully or cost-effectively integrate acquired entities or operations into our operations in a timely manner, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, including potential synergies or growth opportunities, to the extent or in the time frame anticipated. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business.\nOur operations outside the United States may subject us to additional risks.\nA significant portion of our assets, operations and revenues are located in Canada, and we will be subject to risks inherent in business operations outside of the United States. These risks include, without limitation:\n\u2022\nimpact of currency exchange rate fluctuations among the U.S. dollar, the Canadian dollar and foreign currencies relating to our export business, which may reduce the U.S. dollar value of the revenues, profits and cash flows we receive from non-U.S. markets or of our assets in non-U.S. countries or increase our supply costs, as measured in U.S. dollars in those markets;\n\u2022\nexchange controls and other limits on our ability to repatriate earnings from other countries;\n\u2022\npolitical or economic instability, social or labor unrest or changing macroeconomic conditions or other changes in political, economic or social conditions in the respective jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ndifferent regulatory structures (including creditor rights that may be different than in the United States) and unexpected changes in regulatory environments, including changes resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or imposition of onerous trade restrictions, price controls, industry controls, safety controls, employee welfare schemes or other government controls;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities resulting from the conversion and integration of the Canadian subsidiaries\u2019 Canadian dollar denominated, non-GAAP results of operations and statement of financial condition into GAAP-complaint financial statements that can be consolidated with our historical financial reports;\n\u2022\ntax rates that may exceed those in the United States and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements or that may be subject to tax in the United States prior to repatriation and incremental taxes upon repatriation;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs associated with complying with, and enforcement of remedies under, a wide variety of complex domestic and international laws, treaties and regulations;\n\u2022\ndistribution costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation; and\n\u2022\nimposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other trade protection measures, in addition to import or export licensing requirements imposed by various foreign countries.\nIn addition, our management may be required to devote significant time and resources to adapting our systems, policies and procedures in order to successfully manage the integration and operation of foreign assets.\nThe Buckingham and San Juan Acquisitions may subject us to increased regulation and risks associated with underground mining.\nThe operations we acquired with the Buckingham and San Juan mines primarily consist of underground mines. Underground mining operations are generally subject to more stringent safety and health standards than surface mining operations. More stringent state and federal mine safety laws and regulations have included increased sanctions for non-compliance. Future workplace accidents are likely to result in more stringent enforcement and possibly the passage of new laws and regulations. Our re-entry into underground mining operations will subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny and increased costs of regulatory compliance.", "PERMNO": 59467, "SIC": 1220, "TIC": "WLBAQ"}
