Risk Factors\nRisk Factors\nDepressed oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our success is highly dependent on prices for oil and natural gas, which are extremely volatile, and the oil and natural gas markets are cyclical. Approximately 80% of our anticipated 2015 production, on a BOE basis, is oil. Starting in the second half of 2014, the NYMEX price for a barrel of oil has fallen sharply, from a price of $105.37 on June 30, 2014 to $49.76 on February 27, 2015. In addition, NYMEX prices for natural gas have been low compared with historical prices. Extended periods of low prices for oil or natural gas will have a material adverse effect on us. The prices of oil and natural gas depend on factors we cannot control such as weather, economic conditions, and levels of production, actions by OPEC and other countries and government actions. Prices of oil and natural gas will affect the following aspects of our business:\n\u00b7\nour revenues, cash flows and earnings;\n\u00b7\nthe amount of oil and natural gas that we are economically able to produce;\n\u00b7\nour ability to attract capital to finance our operations and the cost of the capital;\n\u00b7\nthe amount we are allowed to borrow under our credit facilities;\n\u00b7\nthe profit or loss we incur in exploring for and developing our reserves; and\n\u00b7\nthe value of our oil and natural gas properties.\nAny substantial and extended decline in the price of oil or natural gas could have an adverse effect on our borrowing capacity, our ability to obtain additional capital, and our revenues, profitability and cash flows.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIf oil and natural gas prices remain depressed for extended periods of time, we may be required to take additional write-downs of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties. We may be required to write-down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties when oil and natural gas prices are low. Under the full cost method, which we use to account for our oil and natural gas properties, the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties may not exceed the present value, discounted at 10%, of future net cash flows from estimated net proved reserves, using the preceding 12-months\u2019 average oil and natural gas prices based on closing prices on the first day of each month, plus the lower of cost or fair market value of our unproved properties. If net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties exceed this limit, we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings. This type of charge will not affect our cash flows, but will reduce the book value of our stockholders\u2019 equity. Because the oil price we are required to use to estimate our future net cash flows is the average price over the 12 months prior to the date of determination of future net cash flows, the full effect of falling prices may not be reflected in our estimated net cash flows for several quarters. We review the carrying value of our properties quarterly and once incurred, a write-down of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date, even if prices increase. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur actual recovery of reserves may substantially differ from our proved reserve estimates and our proved reserve estimates may change over time. This Form 10-K contains estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves and the estimated future net cash flows from such reserves. These estimates are based upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC relating to oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. This process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir and is therefore inherently imprecise. In addition, drilling, testing and production data acquired since the date of an estimate may justify revising an estimate.\nActual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves most likely will vary from the estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this report. Additionally, reserves and future cash flows may be subject to material downward or upward revisions, based on production history, development drilling and exploration activities and prices of oil and natural gas. We incorporate many factors and assumptions into our estimates including:\n\u00b7\nExpected reservoir characteristics based on geological, geophysical and engineering assessments;\n\u00b7\nFuture production rates;\n\u00b7\nFuture oil and natural gas prices and quality and locational differences; and\n\u00b7\nFuture development and operating costs.\nYou should not assume that any present value of future net cash flows from our estimated net proved reserves contained in this Form 10-K represents the market value of our oil and natural gas reserves. We base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves at December 31, 2014 on average 12-month prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. Further, actual future net revenues will be affected by factors such as the amount and timing of actual development expenditures, the rate and timing of production, and changes in governmental regulations or taxes. At December 31, 2014, approximately 25% of the discounted present value of our estimated net proved reserves consisted of PUDs. PUDs represented 45% of total proved reserves by volume. Recovery of PUDs generally requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. Our reserve estimates include the assumption that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop these undeveloped reserves and the actual costs, development schedule, and results associated with these properties may not be as estimated. In addition, the 10% discount factor that we use to calculate the net present value of future net revenues and cash flows may not necessarily be the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital in effect from time to time and the risks associated with our business and the oil and gas industry in general.\nInformation about reserves constitutes forward-looking information. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d for information regarding forward-looking information.\nUnless we replace our oil and gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline. Our future oil and gas production depends on our success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. If we fail to replace reserves through drilling or acquisitions, our production, revenues, reserve quantities and cash flows will decline. In general, production from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted, with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics. Our ability to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our asset base of oil and gas reserves would be limited to the extent cash flow from operations is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nreduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable. We may not be successful in exploring for, developing or acquiring additional reserves.\nExploring for, developing, or acquiring reserves is capital intensive and uncertain. We may not be able to economically find, develop, or acquire additional reserves, or may not be able to make the necessary capital investments to develop our reserves, if our cash flows from operations decline or external sources of capital become limited or unavailable. As part of our exploration and development operations, we have expanded, and expect to further expand, the application of horizontal drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fracture stimulation techniques. The utilization of these techniques requires substantially greater capital expenditures, currently expected to be in excess of three times the cost, as compared to the drilling of a traditional vertical well. If we do not replace the reserves we produce, our reserves revenues and cash flow will decrease over time, which will have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur business requires significant capital expenditures and we may not be able to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Our exploration and development activities are capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business for the development, exploitation, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves. Historically, we have funded our capital expenditures through a combination of cash flows from operations, borrowings under our credit facility and public debt and equity financings. In 2014, our total capital expenditures, including expenditures for leasehold interests and property acquisitions, drilling, seismic and infrastructure, were approximately $455.5 million. Our 2015 capital budget for drilling, completion and infrastructure is estimated to be approximately $150 to $165 million. The actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, commodity prices, actual drilling results, the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment, and regulatory, technological and competitive developments.\nIf the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility or our revenues decrease as a result of lower oil or natural gas prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels. If additional capital is needed, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. If cash generated by operations or cash available under our revolving credit facility is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to development of our drilling locations, which in turn could lead to a possible expiration of our leases and a decline in our estimated net proved reserves, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur revolving credit facility and second lien term loan facility contain restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities. Our credit facilities restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u00b7\ncreate additional liens;\n\u00b7\nsell assets;\n\u00b7\nmerge or consolidate with another entity;\n\u00b7\npay dividends or make other distributions;\n\u00b7\nengage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u00b7\nenter into certain swap agreements.\nIn addition, we will be required to use substantial portions of our future cash flow to repay principal and interest on our indebtedness. Our credit facilities require us to maintain certain financial ratios and tests, including a minimum asset value coverage ratio of total debt. The requirement that we comply with these provisions may materially adversely affect our ability to react to changes in market conditions, take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable, obtain future financing, fund needed capital expenditures or withstand a continuing or future downturn in our business.\nOur borrowings under our revolving credit facility and second lien term loan facility expose us to interest rate risk. Our earnings are exposed to interest rate risk associated with borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which bear interest at a rate elected by us that is based on the prime, LIBOR or federal funds rate plus margins ranging from 1.75% to 2.75% depending on the base rate used and the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base. Our second lien term loan bears interest at a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrate of LIBOR, subject to a floor of 1%, plus 7.50%. If interest rates increase, so will our interest costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe borrowing base under our revolving credit facility may be reduced below the amount of borrowings outstanding under such facilities. Under the terms of our revolving credit facility, our borrowing base is subject to redeterminations at least semi-annually based in part on prevailing oil and gas prices. A negative adjustment could occur if the estimates of future prices used by the banks in calculating the borrowing base are significantly lower than those used in the last redetermination. The next redetermination of our borrowing base is scheduled to occur on or about March 31, 2015. In addition, the portion of our borrowing base made available to us is subject to the terms and covenants of the revolving credit facility including, without limitation, compliance with the financial performance covenants of such facility. In the event the amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility exceeds the redetermined borrowing base, we are required to either (i) grant liens on additional oil and gas properties (not previously evaluated in determining such borrowing base) with a value equal to or greater than such excess or (ii) repay such excess borrowings over five monthly installments. We may not have sufficient funds to make any required repayment. If we do not have sufficient funds and are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing, an event of default would occur under our revolving credit facility.\nThe unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment and crews, other equipment, supplies, water, personnel and oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget. From time to time, our industry has experiences a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, water or qualified personnel. During these periods, the costs and delivery times of rigs, equipment and supplies are substantially greater. In addition, the demand for, and wage rates of, qualified drilling rig crews rise as the number of active rigs in service increases. Increasing levels of exploration and production may increase the demand for oilfield services and equipment, and the costs of these services and equipment may increase, while the quality of these services and equipment may suffer. The unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment, supplies or qualified personnel can materially and adversely affect our operations and profitability.\nOur operations substantially depend on the availability of water. Restrictions on our ability to obtain, dispose of or recycle water may impact our ability to execute our drilling and development plans in a timely or cost-effective manner. Water is an essential component of our drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Historically, we have been able to secure water from local landowners and other sources for use in our operations. During the last few years, West Texas has experienced extreme drought conditions. As a result of the severe drought, some local water districts may begin restricting the use of water under their jurisdiction for drilling and hydraulic fracturing to protect the local water supply. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, we may be unable to economically produce oil, NGLs and natural gas, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur producing properties are located in the Permian Basin of West Texas, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a single geographic area. In addition, we have a large amount of proved reserves attributable to a small number of producing horizons within this area. All of our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Permian Basin of West Texas. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, availability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services market limitations or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil, natural gas or natural gas liquids. In addition, the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil and natural gas producing areas such as the Permian Basin, which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effects of these conditions. Due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties. Such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur exploration projects increase the risks inherent in our oil and natural gas activities. We may seek to replace reserves through exploration, where the risks are greater than in acquisitions and development drilling. Our exploration drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe results of our exploration drilling activities;\n\u00b7\nreceipt of additional seismic data or other geophysical data or the reprocessing of existing data;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nmaterial changes in oil or natural gas prices;\n\u00b7\nthe costs and availability of drilling rigs;\n\u00b7\nthe success or failure of wells drilled in similar formations or which would use the same production facilities;\n\u00b7\navailability and cost of capital;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the estimates of the costs to drill or complete wells; and\n\u00b7\nchanges to governmental regulations.\nDelays in exploration, cost overruns or unsuccessful drilling results could have a material adverse effect on our business and future growth.\nOur exploration and development drilling efforts and the operation of our wells may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns. Exploration, development, drilling and production activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that commercially productive deposits will not be discovered. We may invest in property, including undeveloped leasehold acreage, which we believe will result in projects that will add value over time. However, we cannot guarantee that any leasehold acreage acquired will be profitably developed, that new wells drilled will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such leasehold acreage or wells. Drilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a profit after deducting operating and other costs. In addition, wells that are profitable may not achieve our targeted rate of return.\nIn addition, we may not be successful in controlling our drilling and production costs to improve our overall return. We may be forced to limit, delay or cancel drilling operations as a result of a variety of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u00b7\npressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u00b7\nequipment failures or accidents and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment; and\n\u00b7\ncompliance with governmental requirements.\nFailure to conduct our oil and gas operations in a profitable manner may result in write-downs of our proved reserves quantities, impairment of our oil and gas properties, and a write-down in the carrying value of our unproved properties, and over time may adversely affect our growth, revenues and cash flows.\nOur identified drilling locations are scheduled to be drilled over many years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could prevent them from being drilled or delay their drilling. Our management team has identified drilling locations as an estimation of our future development activities on our existing acreage. These identified drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these identified drilling locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, gathering system, marketing and transportation constraints, regulatory approvals and other factors. Because of these uncertain factors, we do not know if the identified drilling locations will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these drilling locations. In addition, unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the identified locations are located, the leases for such acreage will expire. Therefore, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified.\nThe development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Approximately 45% of our total estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2014, were proved undeveloped reserves and may not be ultimately developed or produced. Recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. The reserve data included in the reserve reports of our independent petroleum engineers assume that substantial capital expenditures are required to develop such reserves. We cannot be certain that the estimated costs of the development of these reserves are accurate, that development will occur as scheduled or that the results of such development will be as estimated. Delays in the development of our reserves, increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves or decreases in commodity prices will reduce the future net revenues of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomical. In addition, delays in the development of reserves could force us to reclassify certain of our proved reserves as unproved reserves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe may be unable to integrate successfully the operations of future acquisitions with our operations, and we may not realize all the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions. Our business may include producing property acquisitions that would include undeveloped acreage. We can offer no assurance that we will achieve the desired profitability from any acquisitions we may complete in the future. In addition, failure to assimilate recent and future acquisitions successfully could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our acquisitions may involve numerous risks, including:\n\u00b7\noperating a larger combined organization and adding operations;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in the assimilation of the assets and operations of the acquired business, especially if the assets acquired are in a new geographic area;\n\u00b7\nrisk that oil and natural gas reserves acquired may not be of the anticipated magnitude or may not be developed as anticipated;\n\u00b7\nloss of significant key employees from the acquired business:\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u00b7\nfailure to realize expected profitability or growth;\n\u00b7\nfailure to realize expected synergies and cost savings;\n\u00b7\ncoordinating geographically disparate organizations, systems and facilities; and\n\u00b7\ncoordinating or consolidating corporate and administrative functions.\nFurther, unexpected costs and challenges may arise whenever businesses with different operations or management are combined, and we may experience unanticipated delays in realizing the benefits of an acquisition. If we consummate any future acquisition, our capitalization and results of operation may change significantly, and you may not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in evaluating future acquisitions. The inability to effectively manage the integration of acquisitions could reduce our focus on subsequent acquisition and current operations, which in turn, could negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe may fail to fully identify problems with any properties we acquire, and as such, assets we acquire may prove to be worth less than we paid because of uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and potential liabilities. We are actively seeking to acquire additional acreage in Texas or other regions in the future. Successful acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors, including estimates of recoverable reserves, exploration potential, future oil and natural gas prices, operating and capital costs and potential environmental and other liabilities. Although we conduct a review of properties we acquire which we believe is consistent with industry practices, we can give no assurance that we have identified or will identify all existing or potential problems associated with such properties or that we will be able to mitigate any problems we do identify. Such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain. In addition, our review may not permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. We do not inspect every well. Even when we inspect a well, we do not always discover structural, subsurface and environmental problems that may exist or arise. We are generally not entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities, including environmental liabilities. Normally, we acquire interests in properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties. As a result of these factors, we may not be able to acquire oil and natural gas properties that contain economically recoverable reserves or be able to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms.\nUnexpected subsurface conditions and other unforeseen operating hazards may adversely impact our ability to conduct business. There are many operating hazards in exploring for and producing oil and natural gas, including:\n\u00b7\nour drilling operations may encounter unexpected formations or pressures, which could cause damage to equipment or personal injury;\n\u00b7\nwe may experience equipment failures which curtail or stop production;\n\u00b7\nwe could experience blowouts or other damages to the productive formations that may require a well to be re-drilled or other corrective action to be taken;\n\u00b7\nstorms and other extreme weather conditions could cause damages to our production facilities or wells.\nBecause of these or other events, we could experience environmental hazards, including release of oil and natural gas from spills, natural gas-leaks, accidental leakage of toxic or hazardous materials, such as petroleum liquids, drilling fluids or fracturing fluids, including chemical additives, underground migration, and ruptures.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIf we experience any of these problems, it could affect well bores, gathering systems and processing facilities, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations. We could also incur substantial losses in excess of our insurance coverage as a result of:\n\u00b7\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u00b7\nsevere damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u00b7\npollution and other environmental damage;\n\u00b7\nclean-up responsibilities;\n\u00b7\nregulatory investigation and penalties;\n\u00b7\nsuspension of our operations; and\n\u00b7\nrepairs to resume operations.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable to cover our possible losses from operating hazards. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFactors beyond our control affect our ability to market production and our financial results. The ability to market oil and natural gas from our wells depends upon numerous factors beyond our control. These factors could negatively affect our ability to market all of the oil or natural gas we produce. In addition, we may be unable to obtain favorable prices for the oil and natural gas we produce. These factors include:\n\u00b7\nthe extent of domestic production and imports of oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nfederal regulations generally prohibiting the export of U.S. crude oil;\n\u00b7\nfederal regulations applicable to exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG);\n\u00b7\nthe proximity of hydrocarbon production to pipelines;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of pipeline capacity;\n\u00b7\nthe demand for oil and natural gas by utilities and other end users;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of alternative fuel sources;\n\u00b7\nthe effects of inclement weather;\n\u00b7\nstate and federal regulation of oil and natural gas marketing; and\n\u00b7\nfederal regulation of natural gas sold or transported in interstate commerce.\nIn particular, in areas with increasing non-conventional shale drilling activity, capacity may be limited and it may be necessary for new interstate and intrastate pipelines and gathering systems to be built.\nThe marketability of our production is dependent upon oil and condensate trucking facilities owned and operated by third parties, and the unavailability of these facilities would have a material adverse effect on our revenue. Our ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of oil and condensate trucking operations owned and operated by third parties. Our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business. We may be required to shut in wells for lack of a market or because of inadequate or unavailable trucking capacity. If that were to occur, we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until production arrangements were made to deliver our production to market. Furthermore, if we were required to shut in wells we might also be obligated to pay shut-in royalties to certain mineral interest owners in order to maintain our leases.\nThe disruption of third party trucking facilities due to maintenance, weather or other factors could negatively impact our ability to market and deliver our oil and condensate. The third parties control when, or if, such trucking facilities are restored and what prices will be charged. In the past, we have experienced disruptions in our ability to market oil and condensate from bad weather. We may experience similar interruptions as we continue to explore and develop our Permian Basin properties in the future. If we were required to shut in our production for long periods of time due to lack of trucking capacity, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPart of our strategy involves drilling in new or emerging shale formations using horizontal drilling and completion techniques. The results of our planned drilling program in these formations may be subject to more uncertainties than conventional drilling programs in more established formations and may not meet our expectations for reserves or production. The results of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nour recent horizontal drilling efforts in new or emerging formations, including certain intervals in the Wolfcamp shale, the Spraberry shale and the Cline shale in the Permian basin, are generally more uncertain than drilling results in areas that are developed and have established production. Because new or emerging formations have limited or no production history, we are less able to rely on past drilling results in those areas as a basis predict our future drilling results. Further, access to adequate gathering systems or pipeline takeaway capacity and the availability of drilling rigs and other services may be more challenging in new or emerging areas. If our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, access to gathering systems and takeaway capacity or otherwise, and/or natural gas and oil prices decline, our investment in these areas may not be as economic as we anticipate, we could incur material write-downs of unevaluated properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate. We depend, and will continue to depend in the foreseeable future, on the services of our senior officers and other key employees, as well as other third-party consultants with extensive experience and expertise in evaluating and analyzing drilling prospects and producing oil and natural gas from proved properties and maximizing production from oil and natural gas properties. Our ability to retain our senior officers, other key employees and our third party consultants, none of whom are subject to employment agreements, is important to our future success and growth. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on our business.\nWe may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed. In accordance with industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the operating risks to which our business is exposed. We cannot assure you that our insurance will be adequate to cover losses or liabilities. Also, we cannot predict the continued availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase. No assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable and may elect none or minimal insurance coverage. The occurrence of a significant event, not fully insured or indemnified against, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nCompetitive industry conditions may negatively affect our ability to conduct operations. We compete with numerous other companies in virtually all facets of our business. Our competitors in development, exploration, acquisitions and production include major integrated oil and gas companies and smaller independents as well as numerous financial buyers, including many that have significantly greater resources. Therefore, competitors may be able to pay more for desirable leases and evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties or prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. We also compete for the materials, equipment and services that are necessary for the exploration, development and operation of our properties. Our ability to increase reserves in the future will be dependent on our ability to select and acquire suitable prospects for future exploration and development. Factors that affect our ability to compete in the marketplace include:\n\u00b7\nour access to the capital necessary to drill wells and acquire properties;\n\u00b7\nour ability to acquire and analyze seismic, geological and other information relating to a property;\n\u00b7\nour ability to retain the personnel necessary to properly evaluate seismic and other information relating to a property;\n\u00b7\nour ability to procure materials, equipment and services required to explore, develop and operate our properties, including the ability to procure fracture stimulation services on wells drilled; and\n\u00b7\nour ability to access pipelines, and the location of facilities used to produce and transport oil and natural gas production.\nCurrent or proposed financial legislation and rulemaking could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business. Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) establishes federal oversight and regulation of over-the-counter derivatives and requires the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d) and the SEC to enact further regulations affecting derivative contracts, including the derivative contracts we use to hedge our exposure to price volatility through the over-the-counter market.\nAlthough the CFTC and the SEC have issued final regulations in certain areas, final rules in other areas and the scope of relevant definitions and/or exemptions still remain to be finalized. In one of its rulemaking proceedings still pending under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC approved on November 5, 2013, a proposed rule imposing position limits for certain futures and option contracts in various commodities (including natural gas) and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Certain specified types of hedging transactions are exempt from these position limits, provided that such hedging transactions satisfy the CFTC\u2019s requirements for \u201cbona fide hedging\u201d transactions or positions. Similarly, the CFTC has issued a proposed rule on margin requirements for swap transactions, which proposes an exemption for commercial end-users, entering into uncleared swaps in order to hedge commercial risks affecting\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ntheir business, from any requirement to post margin to secure such swap transactions. In addition, the CFTC has issued a final rule authorizing an exception for commercial end-users using swaps to hedge their commercial risks from the otherwise applicable mandatory obligation under the Dodd-Frank Act to clear all swap transactions through a registered derivatives clearing organization and to trade all such swaps on a registered exchange. The Dodd-Frank Act also imposes recordkeeping and reporting obligations on counterparties to swap transactions and other regulatory compliance obligations. All of the above regulations could increase the costs to us of entering into financial derivative transactions to hedge or mitigate our exposure to commodity price volatility and other commercial risks affecting our business.\nWhile it is not possible at this time to predict when the CFTC will issue final rules applicable to position limits or margin requirements, depending on the Company\u2019s ability to satisfy the CFTC\u2019s requirements for the various exemptions available for a commercial end-user using swaps to hedge or mitigate its commercial risks, these rules and regulations may require us to comply with position limits, margin requirements and with certain clearing and trade-execution requirements in connection with financial derivative activities. The Dodd-Frank Act may require our current counterparties to post additional capital as a result of entering into uncleared financial derivatives with us, which could increase the cost to us of entering into such derivatives. The Dodd-Frank Act may also require our current counterparties to financial derivative transactions to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties, and may cause some entities to cease their current business as hedge providers. These changes could reduce the liquidity of the financial derivatives markets thereby reducing the ability of commercial end-users to have access to financial derivatives to hedge or mitigate their exposure to commodity price volatility. The Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts (including through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available capital for other commercial operations purposes), materially alter the terms of future swaps relative to the terms of our existing bilaterally negotiated financial derivative contracts, and reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against commercial risks we encounter.\nIf we reduce our use of derivative contracts as a result of the new requirements, our results of operations may become more volatile and cash flows less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the legislation was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe may not have production to offset hedges. Part of our business strategy is to reduce our exposure to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices by hedging a portion of our production. In a typical hedge transaction, we will have the right to receive from the other parties to the hedge the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge over a floating price based on a market index, multiplied by the quantity hedged. If the floating price exceeds the fixed price, we are required to pay the other parties this difference multiplied by the quantity hedged. Additionally, we are required to pay the difference between the floating price and the fixed price when the floating price exceeds the fixed price regardless of whether we have sufficient production to cover the quantities specified in the hedge. Significant reductions in production at times when the floating price exceeds the fixed price could require us to make payments under the hedge agreements even though such payments are not offset by sales of physical production.\nBy hedging, we may not benefit from price increases. Hedging can prevent us from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or natural gas prices above the fixed amount specified in a hedge transaction in the case of a swap. We also enter into price \u201ccollars\u201d to reduce the risk of changes in oil and natural gas prices. Under a collar, no payments are due by either party so long as the market price is above a floor set in the collar and below a ceiling. If the price falls below the floor, the counter-party to the collar pays the difference to us and if the price is above the ceiling, we pay the counter-party the difference. Another type of hedging contract we have entered into is a put contract. Under a put, if the price falls below the set floor price, the counter-party to the contract pays the difference to us. See \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks\u201d for a discussion of our hedging practices.\nOur hedging transactions expose us to counterparty credit risk. Our hedging transactions expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract. Disruptions in the financial markets could lead to sudden decreases in a counterparty\u2019s liquidity, which could make them unable to perform under the terms of the derivative contract and we may not be able to realize the benefit of the derivative contract. During periods of falling commodity prices, our hedging transactions expose us to risk of financial loss if our counterparty to a derivatives transaction fails to perform its obligations under a derivatives transaction (e.g., our counterparty fails to perform its obligation to make payments to us under the derivatives transaction when the market (floating) price under such derivative falls below the specified fixed price). We are unable to predict sudden changes in a counterparty\u2019s\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncreditworthiness or ability to perform. Even if we do accurately predict sudden changes, our ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions. If the creditworthiness of our counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance, we could incur a significant loss.\nThe inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations to us may adversely affect our financial results. Our principal exposures to credit risk are through receivables resulting from the sale of our oil and natural gas production, which we market to energy marketing companies, refineries and affiliates, advances to joint interest parties and joint interest receivables. We are also subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers. The largest purchaser of our oil and natural gas accounted for approximately 51% of our total oil and natural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014. We do not require any of our customers to post collateral. The inability or failure of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results. Joint interest receivables arise from billing entities who own a partial interest in the wells we operate. These entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we choose to drill. We have limited ability to control participation in our wells.\nCompliance with environmental and other government regulations could be costly and could negatively impact production. Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the operation and maintenance of our facilities and the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. For a discussion of the material regulations applicable to us, see \u201cRegulations.\u201d These laws and regulations may:\n\u00b7\nrequire that we acquire permits before commencing drilling;\n\u00b7\nimpose operational, emissions control and other conditions on our activities;\n\u00b7\nrestrict the substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities;\n\u00b7\nlimit or prohibit drilling activities on protected areas such as wetlands and wilderness areas; and\n\u00b7\nrequire measures to remediate or mitigate pollution and environmental impacts from current and former operations, such as cleaning up spills or dismantling abandoned production facilities.\nUnder these laws and regulations, we could be liable for costs of investigation, removal and remediation, damages to and loss of use of natural resources, loss of profits or impairment of earning capacity, property damages, costs of and increased public services, as well as administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties, and injunctive relief. Certain environmental statutes, including the RCRA, CERCLA, OPA and analogous state laws and regulations, impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances or other waste products have been disposed of or otherwise released. We could also be affected by more stringent laws and regulations adopted in the future, including any related to climate change, greenhouse gases and hydraulic fracturing. Under the common law, we could be liable for injuries to people and property. We maintain limited insurance coverage for sudden and accidental environmental damages. We do not believe that insurance coverage for environmental damages that occur over time is available at a reasonable cost. Also, we do not believe that insurance coverage for the full potential liability that could be caused by sudden and accidental environmental damages is available at a reasonable cost. Accordingly, we may be subject to liability or we may be required to cease production from properties in the event of environmental incidents.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gasses\u201d (\u201cGHG\u201d) could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. In the absence of comprehensive federal legislation on GHG emission control, the EPA attempted to require the permitting of GHG emissions. Although the Supreme Court struck down the permitting requirements, it upheld the EPA\u2019s authority to control GHG emissions when a permit is required due to emissions of other pollutants. The EPA recently announced its intention to take measures to require or encourage reductions in methane emissions, including from oil and natural gas operations. Those measures include the development of NSPS regulations in 2016 for reducing methane from new and modified oil and gas production sources and natural gas processing and transmission sources.\nIn addition, the EPA requires the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities and onshore oil and natural gas processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities, which may include facilities we operate. Reporting of GHG emissions from such facilities is required on an annual basis. We will have to incur costs associated with this reporting obligation.\nIn addition, the United States Congress has considered (but not passed) legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs and many states have already taken or have considered legal measures to reduce or measure GHG emissions, often involving the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs would require major sources of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nemissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall GHG emission reduction goal. These allowances would be expected to escalate significantly in cost over time. The adoption and implementation of any legislation or regulatory programs imposing GHG reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGS associated with our operations or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce.\nSignificant physical effects of climatic change have the potential to damage our facilities, disrupt our production activities and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects. In an interpretative guidance on climate change disclosures, the SEC indicates that climate change could have an effect on the severity of weather (including storms and floods), the arability of farmland, and water availability and quality. If such effects were to occur, our exploration and production operations have the potential to be adversely affected. Potential adverse effects could include damages to our facilities from powerful winds or rising waters in low-lying areas, disruption of our production activities either because of climate-related damages to our facilities in our costs of operation potentially arising from such climatic effects, less efficient or non-routine operating practices necessitated by climate effects or increased costs for insurance coverages in the aftermath of such effects. Significant physical effects of climate change could also have an indirect effect on our financing and operations by disrupting the transportation or process-related services provided by midstream companies, service companies or suppliers with whom we have a business relationship. We may not be able to recover through insurance some or any of the damages, losses or costs that may result from potential physical effects of climate change. In addition, our hydraulic fracturing operations require large amounts of water. Should drought conditions occur, our ability to obtain water in sufficient quality and quantity could be impacted and in turn, our ability to perform hydraulic fracturing operations could be restricted or made more costly.\nFederal legislation and state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays. Hydraulic fracturing is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing activities are typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions but not at the federal level, as the federal Safe Drinking Water Act expressly excludes regulation of these fracturing activities (except where diesel is a component of the fracturing fluid). We engage third parties to provide hydraulic fracturing or other well stimulation services to us in connection with the wells for which we are the operator. Contamination of groundwater by oil and natural gas drilling, production, and related operations may result in fines, penalties, and remediation costs, among other sanctions and liabilities under federal and state laws. In addition, third party claims may be filed by landowners and other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages, and bodily injury. In March 2010, the EPA announced that it would conduct a wide-ranging study on the effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. A progress report was issued in December 2012; a final report is not yet available. The agency also announced that one of its enforcement initiatives for 2014 to 2016 would be to focus on environmental compliance by the energy extraction sector. This study and the EPA\u2019s enforcement initiative could result in additional regulatory scrutiny that could make it difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.\nA committee of the U.S. House of Representatives conducted an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices. Legislation was introduced before Congress, but not passed to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. In addition, some states and local or regional regulatory authorities have adopted or are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. For example, New York has announced that it will ban high volume hydraulic fracturing. Further, Pennsylvania has adopted a variety of regulations limiting how and where fracturing can be performed. While we have no operations in either New York or Pennsylvania, any other new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing in areas in which we do operate could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform hydraulic fracturing activities and thereby affect the determination of whether a well is commercially viable. Further, the EPA has announced initiatives under the CWA to establish standards of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing and under TSCA to develop regulations governing the disclosure and evaluation of hydraulic fracturing chemicals, and the BLM has indicated that it will continue with rulemaking to regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal lands. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing becomes further regulated at the federal level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permit requirements or operational restrictions and also to associated permitting delays and potential increases in costs and potential liabilities. Such federal or state legislation could require the disclosure of chemical constituents used in the fracturing process to state or federal regulatory authorities who could then make such information publicly available. In addition, restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce in commercial quantities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe are now subject to regulation under NSPS and NESHAPS programs, which could result in increased operating costs. On April 17, 2012, the EPA issued final rules that subject oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission and storage operations to regulation under the NSPS and the NESHAP programs. The EPA rules include NSPS standards for completions of hydraulically fractured natural gas wells. Before January 1, 2015, these standards require owners/operators to reduce VOC emissions from natural gas not sent to the gathering line during well completion either by flaring, using a completion combustion device, or by capturing the natural gas using green completions with a completion combustion device. Beginning January 1, 2015, operators must capture the natural gas and make it available for use or sale, which can be done through the use of green completions. The standards are applicable to newly fractured wells and also existing wells that are refractured. Further, the finalized regulations also establish specific new requirements, effective in 2012, for emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks, natural gas processing plants and certain other equipment. These rules may require changes to our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax preferences currently available with respect to oil and natural gas production may be eliminated as a result of future legislation. In recent years, the Obama administration\u2019s budget proposals and other proposed legislation have included the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas exploration and production. If enacted into law, these proposals would eliminate certain tax preferences applicable to taxpayers engaged in the exploration or production of natural resources. These changes include, but are not limited to (1) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (2) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (3) the elimination of the deduction for U.S. production activities and (4) the increase in the amortization period from two years to seven years for geophysical costs paid or incurred in connection with the exploration for or development of, oil and gas within the United States. It is unclear whether any such changes will be enacted or how soon any such changes would become effective. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could negatively affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThere are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud that could seriously harm our business may occur and not be detected. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, an evaluation of controls can only provide reasonable assurance that all material control issues and instances of fraud, if any, in our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Further, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or by collusion of two or more persons. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. A failure of our controls and procedures to detect error or fraud could seriously harm our business and results of operations.\nWe have no plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We have no plans to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. In addition, the terms of our credit facilities prohibit us from paying dividends and making other distributions.\nCyber-attacks targeting systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry may adversely impact our operations. Our business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, production and financial activities. We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, and communicate with our employees and third party partners. Unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruptions in our exploration or production operations. Also, computers control nearly all of the oil and gas distribution systems in the United States and abroad, which are necessary to transport our production to market. A cyber-attack directed at oil and gas distribution systems could damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment, delay or prevent delivery of production to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWhile we have not experienced cyber-attacks, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such attacks and resulting losses in the future. Further, as cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber-attacks.", "PERMNO": 80926, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "CPE"}
