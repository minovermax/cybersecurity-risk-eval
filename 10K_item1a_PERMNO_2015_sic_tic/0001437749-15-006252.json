{"cik": "1006424", "company": "BEAR STATE FINANCIAL, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully read and consider the risk factors described below as well as other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the information contained in other filings with the SEC. Any of these risks, if they actually occur, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known by us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may materially and adversely affect us.\nRisks Related to Our Business:\nOur profitability is dependent on our banking activities.\nBecause we are a bank holding company, our profitability is directly attributable to the success of our bank subsidiary. Our banking activities compete with other banking institutions on the basis of service, convenience and price. Due in part to regulatory changes and consumer demands, banks have experienced increased competition from other entities offering similar products and services. We rely on the profitability of our bank subsidiary and dividends received from our bank subsidiary for payment of our operating expenses and satisfaction of our obligations. As is the case with other similarly situated financial institutions, our profitability will be subject to the fluctuating cost and availability of funds, changes in the prime lending rate and other interest rates, changes in economic conditions in general and, because of the location of our banking offices, changes in economic conditions in the State of Arkansas in particular.\nChanges in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s profitability and asset values.\nThe operations of financial institutions such as the Bank are dependent to a large extent on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and investment securities and the interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings. Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect net interest income by affecting the difference between the weighted average yield earned on interest earning assets and the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities, or interest rate spread, and the average life of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Changes in interest rates also can affect our ability to originate loans; the value of our interest earning assets; our ability to obtain and retain deposits in competition with other available investment alternatives; and the ability of borrowers to repay adjustable or variable rate loans. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. As of December 31, 2014, the Bank\u2019s model simulations projected that 100, 200 and 300 basis point increases in interest rates would result in positive variances in net interest income of 2.39%, 4.67% and 6.30%, respectively, relative to the base case over the next twelve months and decreases in interest rates of 100 basis points would result in a negative variance in net interest income of (0.03)% relative to the base case over the next twelve months. Based on these measures, the Bank estimates a limited impact on earnings for various interest rate change scenarios. Significant changes in the composition of our rate sensitive assets or liabilities could result in a more unbalanced position possibly causing interest rate changes to have a material impact on our earnings. In addition, earnings may be adversely affected during any period of changes in interest rates due to a number of factors including among other items, call features and interest rate caps and floors on various assets and liabilities, prepayments, the current interest rates on assets and liabilities to be repriced in each period, and the relative changes in interest rates on different types of assets and liabilities.\nIn addition a significant and prolonged increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the fair value of the investment securities portfolio classified as available for sale and, accordingly, shareholders\u2019 equity. At December 31, 2014 the Bank had $174.2 million of investment securities, all of which were classified as available for sale which resulted in recording a net unrealized gain of $577,000. Based on market rates at December 31, 2014 it was estimated that a 200 basis point increase in rates would have resulted in an approximate 6.3% decrease in the fair value of the securities.\nThe Company and the Bank face strong competition that may adversely affect profitability.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to vigorous competition in all aspects and areas of our business from banks and other financial institutions, including commercial banks, savings and loan associations, savings banks, finance companies, credit unions and other providers of financial services, such as money market mutual funds, brokerage firms, consumer finance companies and insurance companies, and with non-financial institutions, including retail stores that maintain their own credit programs and governmental agencies that make available low cost or guaranteed loans to certain borrowers. Many of our competitors are larger financial institutions with substantially greater resources, lending limits, and larger branch systems. These competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services. Competition from both bank and non-bank organizations will continue. Our inability to compete successfully could adversely affect profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could experience deficiencies in our allowance for loan and lease losses.\nManagement maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses based upon, among other things:\n\u2022 historical experience;\n\u2022 repayment capacity of borrowers;\n\u2022 an evaluation of local, regional and national economic conditions;\n\u2022 regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality;\n\u2022 collateral evaluations;\n\u2022 current trends regarding the volume and severity of problem loans;\n\u2022 the existence and effect of concentrations of credit; and\n\u2022 results of regulatory examinations.\nBased on these factors, management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectability of the loans in the portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and management must make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. In addition, the board of directors and the OCC periodically review the allowance for loan and lease losses and may require an increase in the provision for possible loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs. The OCC\u2019s judgments may differ from management. While management believes that the allowance for loan and lease losses is appropriate based on our evaluation, management may determine that an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses is needed or regulators may require an increase in the allowance. Either of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on key personnel for our success.\nOur operating results and ability to adequately manage our growth and minimize loan and lease losses are highly dependent on the services, managerial abilities and performance of our current executive officers and other key personnel. We have an experienced management team that our board of directors believes is capable of managing and growing our business. We do not have employment contracts with our executive officers or key personnel. Losses of or changes in our current executive officers or other key personnel and their responsibilities may disrupt our business and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Additionally, our ability to retain our current executive officers and other key personnel may be further impacted by existing and proposed legislation and regulations regarding incentive compensation that is affecting the financial services industry. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining our current executive officers or other key personnel, or hiring additional key personnel to assist in executing our growth strategy.\nOur business depends on the condition of the local and regional economies where we operate.\nAll of our banking offices are located in Arkansas and Southeast Oklahoma. As a result our financial condition and results of operations may be significantly impacted by changes in the Arkansas and Oklahoma economies. Slowdown in economic activity, deterioration in housing markets or increases in unemployment and under-employment in these areas may have a significant and disproportionate impact on consumer and business confidence and the demand for our products and services, result in an increase in non-payment of loans and leases and a decrease in collateral value, and significantly impact our deposit funding sources. Any of these events could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nA portion of the loan portfolio is related to commercial real estate and construction activities. Unexpected declines in real estate values and other market uncertainties may negatively impact these loans and could adversely impact results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, approximately 49% of loans consisted of commercial real estate or construction project loans. Commercial real estate and construction lending are generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk due to a variety of factors, including generally larger loan balances, the dependency on successful completion or operation of the project for repayment, a need for a general stability of interest rates and loan terms that often do not require full amortization of the loan over its term and, instead, provide for a balloon payment at stated maturity.\nThe Company and the Bank could be materially and adversely affected if any of our officers or directors fails to comply with bank and other laws and regulations.\nLike any business, we are subject to risk arising from potential employee misconduct, including non-compliance with policies. Any interventions by regulatory authorities following such employee misconduct may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, suspension or expulsion of our officers or directors from the banking industry. In addition to the monetary consequences, these measures could, for example, impact our ability to engage in, or impose limitations on, certain business activities. Significant regulatory action against the Company or the Bank or its officers or directors could materially and adversely affect the Company and the Bank\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm.\nThe Bank may incur increased employee benefit costs which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is a participant in the multiemployer Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan (the \u201cPentegra DB Plan\u201d). Since the Pentegra DB Plan is a multiemployer plan, contributions of participating employers are commingled and invested on a pooled basis without allocation to specific employers or employees. Assets contributed to a multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. In addition, if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the multiemployer plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.\nAlthough the Pentegra DB Plan has been frozen since July 1, 2010, the Company has continued to incur costs consisting of administration and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation insurance expenses as well as amortization charges based on the funding level of the Pentegra DB Plan. The level of amortization charges is determined by the Pentegra DB Plan's funding shortfall, which is determined by comparing the Pentegra DB Plan\u2019s liabilities to the Pentegra DB Plan\u2019s assets. Net pension expense was approximately $3.3 million and $532,000 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and contributions to the Pentegra DB Plan totaled $3.0 million and $622,000 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In the second quarter of 2014, the Company elected to retire certain pension liabilities of the Pentegra DB Plan which resulted in a charge of $2.9 million. Although this election improved the funding status, material increases to the estimated amount of the Bank\u2019s required contribution may occur. Additionally, if the Bank were to terminate its participation in the Pentegra DB Plan, the Bank could incur a significant withdrawal liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nAn inability to make technological advances may reduce the Company and the Bank\u2019s ability to successfully compete.\nThe banking industry is experiencing rapid changes in technology. In addition to improving customer services, effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. As a result, the Company and the Bank\u2019s future success will depend in part on the ability to address customers\u2019 needs by using technology. The Company and the Bank may be unable to effectively develop new technology-driven products and services and may be unsuccessful in marketing these products to our customers. Many competitors have greater resources to invest in technology. Any failure to keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on the Company and the Bank\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to security and operational risks relating to technology that could damage our reputation and our business.\nSecurity breaches in internet banking activities could expose the Company and the Bank to possible liability and reputational damage. Any security compromise could also deter customers from using internet banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information. The Company and the Bank rely on standard internet security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. These precautions and security measures may not protect systems from compromises or breaches that could result in reputational damage. Additionally, the Company and the Bank outsource data processing to a third party. If the third party provider encounters difficulties or if the Company and the Bank have difficulty in communicating with such third party, it could significantly affect our ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions, which could significantly affect our business operations. The Bank has never incurred a material security breach nor encountered any significant down time with our outsourced partners. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of our systems could damage our reputation, result in loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe current economic environment poses significant challenges for us and could continue to adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is operating in a challenging and uncertain economic environment, including generally uncertain national and local conditions. Financial institutions continue to be affected by declines in the real estate market and constrained financial markets in recent years. These declines, especially in the housing market, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment, resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by the Bank and other financial institutions. Additional or recurring declines in real estate values, home sales volumes, and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the uncertain economic environment could have an adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s borrowers or their customers, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. A worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects on the Company and others in the financial services industry. For example, further deterioration in local economic conditions in the Company\u2019s markets could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in its allowance for loan and lease losses or could require further write-downs of the Bank\u2019s real estate owned. The Company may also face the following risks in connection with these events:\n\u25a0\nEconomic conditions in the Bank\u2019s markets that negatively affect housing prices and the job market have resulted, and may continue to result, in deterioration in credit quality of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio, and such deterioration in credit quality has had, and could continue to have, a negative impact on the Company\u2019s business and financial condition.\n\u25a0\nMarket developments may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates on loans and other credit facilities.\n\u25a0\nThe processes the Company uses to estimate the allowance for loan and lease losses may no longer be reliable because they rely on complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions, which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation.\n\u25a0\nThe Bank\u2019s ability to assess the creditworthiness of its customers may be impaired if the processes and approaches it uses to select, manage, and underwrite its customers become less predictive of future charge-offs.\n\u25a0\nThe Company has faced and expects to continue to face increased regulation of its industry, and compliance with such regulation has increased and may continue to increase its costs, limit its ability to pursue business opportunities, and increase compliance challenges.\nAs these conditions or similar ones continue to exist or worsen, the Company could experience continuing or increased adverse effects on its financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risks.\nA significant portion of our loan and lease portfolio is secured by real property. In the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to real properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. Additionally, we have acquired a number of retail banking facilities and other real properties as a result of the FNSC merger, any of which may contain hazardous or toxic substances. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. We have policies and procedures that require either formal or informal evaluation of environmental risks and liabilities on real property (i) before originating any loan or foreclosure action, except for (a) loans originated for sale in the secondary market secured by one-to-four family residential properties and (b) certain loans where the real estate collateral is second lien collateral. These policies, procedures and evaluations may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nIf we do not properly manage our credit risk, our business could be seriously harmed.\nThere are substantial risks inherent in making any loan or lease, including, but not limited to -\n\u25a0\nrisks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions;\n\u25a0\nrisks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers;\n\u25a0\nrisks inherent from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral; and\n\u25a0\nthe risk of non-payment of loans and leases.\nAlthough we attempt to minimize our credit risk through prudent loan and lease underwriting procedures and by monitoring concentrations of our loans and leases, there can be no assurance that these underwriting and monitoring procedures will reduce these risks. Moreover, as we expand into new markets, credit administration and loan and lease underwriting policies and procedures may need to be adapted to local conditions. The inability to properly manage our credit risk or appropriately adapt our credit administration and loan and lease underwriting policies and procedures to local market conditions or changing economic circumstances could have an adverse impact on our provision for loan and lease losses and our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe rely on certain external vendors.\nWe are reliant upon certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations. Accordingly, our operations are exposed to risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements. We maintain a system of policies and procedures designed to monitor vendor risks including, among other things, (i) changes in the vendor\u2019s organizational structure, (ii) changes in the vendor\u2019s financial condition and (iii) changes in the vendor\u2019s support for existing products and services. While we believe these policies and procedures help to mitigate risk, the failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or the service level agreements could be disruptive to our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by risks associated with completed and potential acquisitions.\nWe plan to continue to grow our business organically. However, we have pursued and expect to pursue additional acquisition opportunities that we believe support our business strategy and may enhance our profitability. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u25cf\nincurring time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and negotiating potential transactions, resulting in our attention being diverted from the operation of our existing business;\n\u25cf\nusing inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution or assets;\n\u25cf\nthe risk that the acquired business will not perform to our expectations;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties, inefficiencies or cost overruns in integrating and assimilating the organizational cultures, operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired business with ours;\n\u25cf\nthe risk of key vendors not fulfilling our expectations or not accurately converting data;\n\u25cf\nentering geographic and product markets in which we have limited or no direct prior experience;\n\u25cf\nthe potential loss of key employees, customers and deposits of acquired banks;\n\u25cf\nthe potential for liabilities and claims arising out of the acquired businesses; and\n\u25cf\nthe risk of not receiving required regulatory approvals or such approvals being restrictively conditional.\nAcquisitions of financial institutions also involve operational risks and uncertainties, and acquired companies may have unknown or contingent liabilities with no corresponding accounting allowance, exposure to unexpected asset quality problems that require writedowns or write-offs (as well as restructuring and impairment or other charges), difficulty retaining key employees and customers and other issues that could negatively affect our business. We may not be able to realize any projected cost savings, synergies or other benefits associated with any such acquisition we complete. Acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and, therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Failure to successfully integrate the entities we acquire into our existing operations could increase our operating costs significantly and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe must generally satisfy a number of meaningful conditions prior to completing any acquisition, including, in certain cases, federal and state regulatory approval. Bank regulators consider a number of factors when determining whether to approve a proposed transaction, including the effect of the transaction on financial stability and the ratings and compliance history of all institutions involved, including Community Reinvestment Act compliance, examination results and anti-money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act compliance records of all institutions involved. The process for obtaining required regulatory approvals has become substantially more difficult as a result of the recent financial crisis, which could affect our future business. We may fail to pursue, evaluate or complete strategic and competitively significant business opportunities as a result of our inability, or our perceived inability, to obtain any required regulatory approvals in a timely manner or at all.\nIn addition, we face significant competition from numerous other financial services institutions, many of which will have greater financial resources than we do, when considering acquisition opportunities. Accordingly, attractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or completing any future acquisitions.\nRisks Related to Our Industry:\nThe Company and the Bank operate in a heavily regulated environment, and that regulation could limit or restrict our activities and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nThe financial services industry is highly regulated and subject to examination, supervision, and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state agencies, including the OCC, the FRB and the FDIC. Compliance with these regulations is costly and may restrict some of our activities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates and locations of offices. The regulators\u2019 interpretation and application of relevant regulations are beyond our control and may change rapidly and unpredictably. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors. These regulations may not always be in the best interest of investors.\nIn light of current conditions in the global financial markets and the global economy, regulators have increased their focus on the financial services industry. Over the past several years, the scale of response by U.S. financial regulators has been significant. New legislative proposals continue to be introduced in the U.S. Congress that could further substantially increase regulation of the financial services industry and impose restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices, including with respect to compensation, interest rates and the effect of bankruptcy proceedings on consumer real property mortgages. Further, federal and state regulatory agencies may adopt changes to their regulations and/or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. Management cannot predict the substance or effect of pending or future legislation or regulation or the application of laws and regulation to the Company or the Bank. Compliance with current and potential regulation and scrutiny may significantly increase costs, impede the efficiency of internal business processes, require us to increase regulatory capital and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner by requiring us to expend significant time, effort and resources to ensure compliance. Additionally, evolving regulations concerning executive compensation may impose limitations that affect our ability to compete successfully for executive and management talent.\nIn addition, given the current economic and financial environment, our regulators may elect to alter standards or their interpretation of the standards used to measure regulatory compliance or to determine the adequacy certain risk management or other operational practices for financial services companies. Any alteration to or interpretation of these standards may impact our ability to implement our strategy and could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the regulatory agencies have discretion in their interpretation of the regulations and laws and their interpretation of the quality of our loan portfolio, securities portfolio and other assets. If any regulatory agency\u2019s assessment of our asset quality differs negatively from ours, additional charges may be required that would have the effect of materially reducing our earnings, capital ratios and stock price.\nThe U.S. Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) on July 21, 2010, which includes sweeping changes in the banking regulatory environment. While many of the provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act are aimed at larger financial institutions, and some will affect only institutions with different charters or institutions that engage in different activities, it has and will likely continue to increase the Company and the Bank\u2019s regulatory compliance burden and may have other adverse effects, including increasing the costs associated with regulatory examinations and compliance measures. The Company and the Bank are closely monitoring all relevant sections of the Dodd-Frank Act to ensure continued compliance with laws and regulations. While the ultimate effects of the Dodd-Frank Act on the Company and the Bank are still undetermined, the law is likely to result in increased compliance costs, higher regulatory costs, and possible operational restrictions.\nFurther, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory authorities continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including interpretation and implementation of statutes, regulation or policies, including the Dodd-Frank Act, could affect the Company or the Bank in substantial and unpredictable ways, including limiting the types of financial services and products offered or increasing the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products. While management cannot predict the regulatory changes that may be borne out of the current economic crisis, and cannot predict whether the Company or the Bank will become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny by any of these regulatory agencies, any regulatory changes or scrutiny could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance among banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations and other institutions. Management cannot predict whether additional legislation will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any regulations, would have on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and the Bank.\nThe fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nThe FRB regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. Its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments, both of which may affect our net interest income and net interest margin. Changes in the supply of money and credit can also materially decrease the value of financial assets we hold, such as debt securities. The FRB\u2019s policies can also adversely affect borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans and leases. Changes in such policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict; consequently, the impact of these changes on our activities and results of operations is difficult to predict.\nReductions in interchange fees would reduce our non-interest income.\nAn interchange fee is a fee merchants pay to the interchange network in exchange for the use of the network\u2019s infrastructure and payment facilitation, and which is paid to debit, credit and prepaid card issuers to compensate them for the costs associated with card issuance and operation. In the case of credit cards, this includes the risk associated with lending money to customers. We earn interchange fees on these card transactions, including approximately $1.5 million in fees during 2014. Merchants, trying to decrease their operating expenses, have sought to, and have had some success at, lowering interchange rates. In particular, the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act limited the amount of interchange fees that may be charged for debit and prepaid card transactions. Several recent events and actions indicate a continuing focus on interchange fees by both regulators and merchants. Beyond pursuing litigation, legislation and regulation, merchants are also pursuing alternate payment platforms as a means to lower payment processing costs. To the extent interchange fees are further reduced, our non-interest income from those fees will be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, the payment card industry is subject to the operating regulations and procedures set forth by payment card networks, and our failure to comply with these operating regulations, which may change from time to time, could subject us to various penalties or fees or the termination of our license to use the payment card networks, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFuture bank failures across the country could significantly increase FDIC premiums.\nDifficult economic conditions in recent years have resulted in increased bank failures and expectations of future bank failures. In the event of a bank failure, the FDIC takes control of a failed bank and ensures payment of deposits up to insured limits using the resources of the DIF. The FDIC is required by law to maintain adequate funding of the DIF, and the FDIC may increase premium assessments to maintain such funding. Recent bank failures have substantially depleted the insurance fund of the FDIC and reduced the fund's ratio of reserves to insured deposits. If the FDIC elects to increase deposit insurance premiums and assessments, the Company\u2019s noninterest expense could increase significantly.\nFuture bank failures in local markets could cause increased and bulk sales of bank-owned properties, reducing the value of our REO, resulting in additional losses, costs and expenses that may negatively affect the Company\u2019s operations.\nFuture bank failures or an increase in the number of troubled banks in the Bank\u2019s geographic regions could adversely impact the value of our REO. Declines in the housing market during recent years, with decreasing home prices and increasing delinquencies and foreclosures, have negatively impacted the credit performance of real estate loans and resulted in significant write-downs of assets by many financial institutions in our markets. Future bank failures or an increase in the number of troubled banks in the areas in which the Bank operates could exacerbate these conditions. Such effects may be particularly pronounced in a market like Northwest Arkansas with reduced real estate values and excess inventory, which may make the disposition of REO properties more difficult, increase maintenance costs and expenses, and reduce the Company\u2019s ultimate realization from any REO sales. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had $4.8 million and $8.6 million of REO, respectively. At December 31, 2014, the Bank\u2019s REO portfolio included $2.8 million of land. Land sales and values have been particularly slow to recover. While the Bank\u2019s REO and REO-related expenses are trending downward due to a decrease in the amount of its REO properties and management believes that general economic conditions in its market areas have been improving, a slowing or reversal in this economic recovery or future weakness in the housing market could reduce the value of the Bank\u2019s existing REO. Additionally, if such conditions materialize, the number of properties comprising the Bank\u2019s REO portfolio could increase. If the amount of the Bank\u2019s REO properties or real estate owned by other banks in our market areas increases, the Company\u2019s losses and the costs and expenses of maintaining our REO would likely increase. Any additional increase in losses, and maintenance costs and expenses due to REO could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock:\nThe trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock is lower than that of other financial services companies and the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, which can make it difficult to sell shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at times, volumes and prices attractive to our stockholders.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol \u201cBSF.\u201d The average daily trading volume for shares of our common stock is lower than larger financial institutions. Because the trading volume of our common stock is lower, and thus has substantially less liquidity than the average trading market for many other publicly traded companies, sales of our common stock may place significant downward pressure on the market price of our common stock. In addition, market value of thinly traded stocks can be more volatile than stocks trading in an active public market.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, in addition to those described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated quarterly or annual fluctuations in our operating results, cash flows and financial condition;\n\u25cf\nchanges in earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to us or other financial institutions;\n\u25cf\nspeculation in the press or investment community generally or relating to our reputation or the financial services industry;\n\u25cf\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, restructurings, dispositions or financings;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;\n\u25cf\nfuture issuances or re-sales of our equity or equity-related securities, or the perception that they may occur;\n\u25cf\nproposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments;\n\u25cf\nanticipated or pending investigations, proceedings, or litigation or accounting matters that involve or affect us;\n\u25cf\ndomestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry.\nIn addition, in recent years, the stock markets in general have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, and market prices for the stock of many companies, including those in the financial services sector, have experienced wide price fluctuations that have not necessarily been related to operating performance. This is due, in part, to investors\u2019 shifting perceptions of the effect of changes and potential changes in the economy on various industry sectors. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including for reasons unrelated to their performance or prospects. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, notwithstanding our actual or anticipated operating results, cash flows and financial condition. The Company expects that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate due to many factors, including prevailing interest rates, other economic conditions, our operating performance and investor perceptions of the outlook for the Company and the Bank specifically and the banking industry in general.\nAs a result of the lower trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock and its susceptibility to market price volatility, stockholders may not be able to resell their shares at times, volumes or prices they find attractive.\nBear State Financial Holdings, LLC holds a controlling interest in the Company\u2019s common stock and may have interests that differ from the interests of other stockholders.\nBear State Financial Holdings, LLC (\u201cBSF Holdings\u201d) currently owns approximately 57% of the outstanding shares of Company common stock. As a result, BSF Holdings is able to control the election of directors, determine corporate and management policies and determine the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to Company stockholders for approval. Such transactions may include mergers and acquisitions, sales of all or some of the Company\u2019s assets or purchases of assets, and other significant corporate transactions. BSF Holdings also has sufficient voting power to amend our organizational documents.\nThe interests of BSF Holdings may differ from those of the Company\u2019s other stockholders, and it may take actions that advance its interests to the detriment of other stockholders.\nThis concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control or impeding a merger or consolidation, takeover or other business combination that could be favorable to the other holders of the Company\u2019s common stock, and the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may be adversely affected by the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price.\nAs a controlled company, the Company is exempt from certain NASDAQ corporate governance requirements, and holders of its common stock may not have all the protections that these rules are intended to provide.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is currently listed on the NASDAQ Global Market. NASDAQ generally requires a majority of directors to be independent and requires independent director oversight over the nominating and executive compensation functions. However, under NASDAQ\u2019s rules, if an individual or another entity owns more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors of a listed company, that company is considered a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and is exempt from rules relating to independence of the board of directors and the compensation and nominating committees. The Company is a controlled company because BSF Holdings owns more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors. Accordingly, the Company is exempt from certain corporate governance requirements, and holders of the Company\u2019s common stock may not have all the protections that these rules are intended to provide. Notwithstanding the Company\u2019s exemption from these requirements, six of the nine current directors of the Company are deemed to be independent in accordance with NASDAQ listing requirements.\nShares of Company common stock are not an insured deposit and are subject to substantial investment risk.\nInvestments in Company common stock are not a savings or deposit account or other obligation of its subsidiary bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other governmental agency. Investment in Company common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this \"RISK FACTORS\" section and in the documents incorporated by reference, and is subject to the same market forces that affect the market price of common stock of any company. As a result, you may lose some or all of your investment.\nCombining the systems and operations of First National, First Federal, and Heritage Bank may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected, and failure to do so quickly and efficiently could reduce the Company\u2019s profitability, affect its stock price and either delay or prevent realization of many of the potential benefits of the merger.\nThe success of the Company following the merger may depend in large part on the ability to integrate the two businesses and cultures. If the Company and FNSC are not able to integrate their operations efficiently and timely, the expected benefits of the merger may not be realized. It is possible that the integration process following completion of the merger could result in the loss of key employees, disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect the combined company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with the Company\u2019s existing customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. As with any merger of banking institutions, there also may be business disruptions that cause the Company to lose customers. Following the merger, the Company may be required to spend additional time and money on operating compatibility, which could otherwise be spent on developing the Company\u2019s business. If the Company does not integrate operations effectively or efficiently, it could harm the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture issuances of additional equity securities could result in dilution of existing stockholders\u2019 equity ownership.\nWe may determine from time to time to issue additional equity securities to raise additional capital, support growth, or, as we have in recent years, to make acquisitions. Further, we may issue stock options, grant restricted stock awards or other stock grants to retain, compensate and/or motivate our employees and directors. These issuances of our securities could dilute the voting and economic interests of existing stockholders.", "PERMNO": 83504, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "BSF"}
