{"cik": "1503518", "company": "21st Century Oncology Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-08-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, in evaluating our company and our business. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe depend on payments from government Medicare and, to a lesser extent, Medicaid programs for a significant amount of our revenue. Our business could be materially harmed by any changes that result in reimbursement reductions.\nOur payer mix is concentrated with Medicare patients due to the high proportion of cancer patients over the age of 65. We estimate that approximately 40% of our U.S. net patient service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of payments from Medicare and Medicaid. Only a small percentage of that revenue resulted from Medicaid patients, equaling approximately 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, Medicare Advantage represents approximately 14% of our 2015 U.S. net patient service revenue. These government programs generally reimburse us on a fee-for-service basis based on predetermined government reimbursement rate schedules. As a result of these reimbursement schedules, we are limited in the amount we can record as revenue for our services from these government programs. Following a public comment period, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") can change these schedules annually and therefore the prices that the agency pays for these services. In addition, if our operating costs increase, we will not be able to recover these costs from government payers. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in reimbursement for Medicare reimbursement. Various state Medicaid programs also have recently reduced Medicaid payments to providers based on state budget reductions. There can be no certainty as to whether Medicaid reimbursement will increase or decrease in the future and what affect, if any, this will have on our business.\nReforms to the U.S. healthcare system may adversely affect our business.\nA significant portion of our U.S. patient volume is derived from government programs, principally Medicare, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. We anticipate the Health Care Reform Act will continue to significantly affect how the healthcare industry operates in relation to Medicare, Medicaid and the insurance industry. The Health Care Reform Act contains a number of provisions, including those governing fraud and abuse, enrollment in federal healthcare programs, and reimbursement changes, which impact existing government healthcare programs and will continue to result in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program.\nThe Health Care Reform Act provides for the creation of health insurance \"Marketplaces\" in each state where individuals can compare and enroll in Quality Health Plans (\"QHPs\"). Some QHPs will be partially subsidized by Federal funds. The presence of federal funds in QHPs in the form of subsidies and cost sharing may subject providers to heightened government attention and enforcement, which could significantly increase the cost of compliance and could materially impact our operations.\nFurthermore, an open question remains whether the availability of these federal subsidies classifies a QHP as a federal healthcare program. If QHPs are classified as federal healthcare programs it could significantly increase the cost of compliance for providers.\nWe can give no assurance that the Health Care Reform Act will not adversely affect our business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes or judicial rulings relating to healthcare reform would affect our business.\nIf payments by managed care organizations and other commercial payers decrease, our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe estimate that approximately 59% of our net patient service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was derived from commercial payers such as managed care organizations and private health insurance programs as well as individuals. As of December 31, 2015, we had over 1,200 contracts with commercial payers. These commercial payers generally reimburse us for services rendered to insured patients based upon predetermined rates. Rates for health maintenance organization benefit plans are typically lower than those for preferred provider organization or other benefit plans that offer broader provider access. When Medicare rates change, these commercial rates automatically change as well. Additionally, most commercial payers tend to negotiate their rates as a percentage of Medicare reimbursement. Even when our commercial rates are fixed and not tied directly to changes in Medicare, there is often pressure to renegotiate our reimbursement to align with these modified levels. If managed care organizations and other private insurers reduce their rates or we experience a significant shift in our revenue mix toward certain additional managed care payers or Medicare or Medicaid reimbursements, then our revenue and profitability may decline and our operating margins will be reduced. Non-government payers, including managed care payers, continue to demand discounted fee structures, and the trend toward consolidation among non-government payers tends to increase their bargaining power over fee structures. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to retain and renew our managed care contracts as well as enter into new managed care contracts on terms favorable to us. Any inability to maintain suitable financial arrangements with commercial payers could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIncreasingly, commercial payers are turning to third-party benefits managers to pre-certify radiation oncology services or develop payment-based treatment protocols. The failure to obtain such pre-certifications and adhere to such protocols can result in the payers' denial of payment in whole or in part. While we are working with such benefits managers to assure compliance with their policies or to obtain modification of what we believe to be inappropriate policies, there can be no assurance that they will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur overall business results may suffer from an economic downturn.\nDuring economic downturns, governmental entities often experience budget deficits as a result of increased costs and lower than expected tax collections. These budget deficits may force federal, state and local government entities to decrease spending for health and human service programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and similar programs, which represent significant payer sources for our treatment centers. Other risks we face from general economic weakness include potential declines in the population covered under managed care agreements, patient decisions to postpone or cancel elective procedures as well as routine diagnostic examinations, potential increases in the uninsured and underinsured populations and further difficulties in collecting patient co-payment and deductible receivables.\nDue to the rising costs of managed care premiums and co-pay amounts, we may realize an increased exposure to bad debt due to patients' inability to pay for certain forms of cancer treatment.\nAs more patients become uninsured as a result of job losses or receive reduced coverage as a result of cost-control measures by employers to offset the increased costs of managed care premiums, patients are becoming increasingly responsible for the rising costs of treatment, which can increase our exposure to bad debt. This also relates to patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has\npaid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (deductibles and co-payments) remain outstanding. The shifting responsibility to pay for care has, in some instances, resulted in patients electing not to receive certain forms of cancer treatment.\nIn response, we have improved our processes associated with verification of insurance eligibility and patient responsibility payment programs. In addition, we have improved our patient financial counseling efforts and developed tools to monitor our progress in this area. However, an increase in the proportion of accounts receivable being comprised of uninsured accounts and a deterioration in the collectability of these accounts will adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nWe depend on recruiting and retaining qualified healthcare professionals for our success.\nOur success is dependent upon our continuing ability to recruit, train and retain or affiliate with radiation oncologists, ICC physicians, physicists, dosimetrists and radiation therapists. While there is currently a national shortage of certain of these healthcare professionals, we have not experienced significant problems attracting and retaining key personnel and professionals in the recent past. We face competition for such personnel from other healthcare providers, research and academic institutions, government entities and other organizations. In the event we are unable to recruit and retain these professionals, the national shortage of healthcare professionals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow. Additionally, many of our senior radiation oncologists, due to their reputations and experience, are very important in the recruitment and education of radiation oncologists. The loss of any such senior radiation oncologists could negatively impact us.\nOur non-compete agreements with our physicians may not be enforceable.\nMost of our radiation oncologists and other ICC physicians in the United States are employed under employment agreements which, among other things, provide that they will not compete with us (or the professional corporations contracting with us) for a period of time after their employment terminates. Such covenants not to compete are enforced to varying degrees from state to state. Since our success depends in substantial part on our ability to preserve the business of our radiation oncologists and other ICC physicians, a determination that these provisions are unenforceable could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe depend on our senior management and we may be materially harmed if we lose any member of our senior management.\nWe are dependent upon the services of our senior management, especially Daniel E. Dosoretz, M.D., our Chief Executive Officer, and a director on the Company's Board of Directors (the \"Board\" or \"Board of Directors\"). We have entered into executive employment and non-competition agreements with certain members of our senior management. Because many members of our senior management team have been with us for over 10 years and have contributed greatly to our growth, their services would be very difficult, time consuming and costly to replace. We carry key-man life insurance on Dr. Daniel Dosoretz. The loss of key management personnel or our inability to attract and retain qualified management personnel could have a material adverse effect on us. A decision by any of these individuals to leave our employ, to compete with us or to reduce their involvement in our business, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe oncology treatment market is highly competitive.\nThe cancer treatment market is highly competitive in each market in which we operate. Our treatment centers face competition from hospitals, other medical practitioners and other operators of radiation treatment centers. There is a growing trend by hospitals to employ medical oncologists and other ICC physicians. We compete against hospitals and other providers to employ these individuals,\nwhich generally results in such physicians referring their patients to the hospitals' radiation facilities, rather than other free-standing facilities. There is also a growing trend of physicians in specialties other than radiation oncology, such as urology, entering the radiation treatment business. If these trends continue it could harm our referrals and our business. Certain of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial and other resources than us. In addition, in states that do not require a certificate of need for the purchase, construction or expansion of healthcare facilities or services, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent. If our competitors are better able to attract patients, recruit physicians, expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities than our centers, we may experience an overall decline in patient volume. In the event that we are not able to compete successfully, our business may be adversely affected and competition may make it more difficult for us to affiliate with or employ additional radiation oncologists on terms that are favorable to us.\nWe could be the subject of governmental investigations, claims and litigation.\nHealthcare companies are subject to numerous types of investigations by various governmental agencies. Further, under the False Claims Act, private parties have the right to bring \"qui tam,\" or \"whistleblower,\" suits against companies that knowingly submit false claims for payments to, or improperly retain overpayments from, the government. Penalties can include substantial fines. Some states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions. In February 2014, for example, the Company was served with subpoenas from the OIG and the U.S. Attorney's Office as part of a civil False Claims Act investigation regarding the ordering, billing and medical necessity of certain laboratory services as well as the Company's agreements with certain physicians. The laboratory services related to the utilization of fluorescence in situ hybridization (\"FISH\") laboratory tests ordered by certain physicians employed by the Company. In December 2015, our subsidiary, 21st Century Oncology, LLC (\"21C LLC\"), entered into a settlement agreement with the federal government, among others, to resolve the matter. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, 21C LLC agreed to pay $19.75 million to the federal government and approximately $0.5 million in attorneys' fees and costs related to the qui tam action. In connection with the settlement agreement, 21C LLC entered into a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement (the \"CIA\"), with the OIG. Violations of the CIA could subject us to substantial monetary penalties or result in exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Further, during the first quarter of 2016, we discovered that certain of our employees may have falsely certified meaningful use attestations for program years 2012, 2013 and 2014. As a result, we agreed to reimburse approximately $6.6 million to Medicare. See \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings\" for additional information. Similar governmental investigations, claims, litigation or settlement in the future could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flow.\nIn addition, governmental agencies and their agents, such as the Medicare Administrative Contractors, as well as the OIG, CMS and state Medicaid programs, conduct audits of our healthcare operations. Private payers may conduct similar post-payment audits, and we also perform internal audits and monitoring. Depending on the nature of the conduct found in such audits and whether the underlying conduct could be considered systemic, the resolution of these audits could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flow.\nFurthermore, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 established the Recovery Audit Contractor (\"RAC\") three-year demonstration program to conduct post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in the fee-for-service Medicare program. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 made the RAC program permanent and expanded the program nationwide as of 2010 and mandated the expansion of the RAC program to Medicaid. State Medicaid agencies have also increased their review activities. Should we be found out of compliance with any of these laws, regulations or programs, or enter into any settlement agreements\nas a result of such government investigation, our business, our financial position and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to actions for false claims, which could harm our business, if we do not comply with government coding and billing rules.\nIf we fail to comply with federal and state documentation, coding and billing rules, we could be subject to criminal and/or civil penalties, loss of licenses and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which could harm us. We estimate that approximately 40% of our U.S. net patient service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of payments from Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, Medicare Advantage represents approximately 14% of our 2015 U.S. net patient service revenue. In billing for our services to third-party payers, we must follow complex documentation, coding and billing rules. These rules are based on federal and state laws, rules and regulations, various government pronouncements, and on industry practice. Failure to follow these rules could result in potential civil liability under the False Claims Act, under which extensive financial penalties can be imposed. It could further result in criminal liability under various federal and state criminal statutes. We submit thousands of claims for Medicare and other payments and there can be no assurance that there have not been errors. While we carefully and regularly review our documentation, coding and billing practices as part of our compliance program, the rules are frequently vague and confusing and we cannot assure that governmental investigators, private insurers or private whistleblowers will not challenge our practices. Such a challenge could result in a material adverse effect on our business. For example, in 2014, we received two Civil Investigative Demands (\"CIDs\") from the DOJ pursuant to the False Claims Act. The CIDs requested information concerning allegations that we knowingly billed for services that were not medically necessary related to a radiation dose calculation system called Gamma. As a result, in March 2016, we entered into a settlement with the federal government in which we agreed to pay a settlement amount of $34.7 million. See \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings\" for additional information.\nIf we fail to comply with the federal anti-kickback statute, we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties, loss of licenses and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which could materially harm us.\nA provision of the Social Security Act, commonly referred to as the federal anti-kickback statute, prohibits the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for referring, ordering, leasing, purchasing or arranging for or recommending the ordering, purchasing or leasing of items or services payable by Medicare, Medicaid or any other federally funded healthcare program. The federal anti-kickback statute is very broad in scope, as remuneration includes the transfer of anything of value, in cash or in kind. Financial relationships covered by this statute can include any relationship where remuneration is provided for referrals including payments not commensurate with fair market value, whether in the form of space, equipment leases, professional or technical services or anything else of value. Violations of the federal anti-kickback statute may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties, including exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Such penalties, if applied to us or one or more of our subsidiaries or affiliates, could result in significant reductions in our revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurthermore, under a provision of the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, civil monetary penalties (and exclusion) may be imposed on any person who offers or transfers remuneration to any patient who is a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary, when the person knows or should know that the remuneration is likely to induce the patient to receive medical services from a particular provider. In addition, most of the states in which we operate, including Florida, have also adopted laws, similar to the federal anti-kickback statute, that prohibit payments to physicians in exchange for referrals, some of which apply regardless of whether the source of payment is a government payer or a private payer. These statutes typically impose criminal and civil penalties as well as loss of licenses.\nWe have reviewed our practices of providing services to our patients, and have structured those services in a manner that we believe complies with the law and its interpretation by government authorities. We cannot provide assurances, however, that government authorities will not take a contrary view and impose civil monetary penalties and exclude us for past or present practices.\nIf we fail to comply with physician self-referral laws as they are currently interpreted or may be interpreted in the future, or if other legislative restrictions are issued, we could incur a significant loss of reimbursement revenue.\nWe are subject to the federal Stark Law, as well as similar state statutes and regulations, which bans payments for designated health services (\"DHS\") rendered as a result of referrals by physicians to DHS entities with which the physicians (or immediate family members) have a financial relationship. The regulatory framework of the Stark Law is to first prohibit all referrals from physicians to entities for Medicare DHS and then to accept certain types of arrangements from that broad general prohibition.\nViolation of these federal and state laws and regulations may result in prohibition of payment for services rendered, loss of licenses, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid programs, and potential false claims liability, including via \"qui tam\" action. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute and any violation is subject to repayment of all \"tainted\" referrals.\nOur compensation and other financial arrangements with physicians are governed by the federal Stark Law. We rely on certain exceptions to the Stark Law, including those covering employees and in-office ancillary services, and the exclusion of certain requests by radiation oncologists for radiation therapy services from the definition of \"referral.\" Under our ICC model, we have relationships with non-radiation oncology physicians such as medical oncologists, surgeons and urologists that are members of a group practice with our radiation oncologists and we rely on the Stark group practice definition and rules with respect to such relationships.\nThe Health Care Reform Act also imposes new disclosure requirements, including one such requirement on referring physicians under the Stark Law to inform patients that they may obtain certain imaging services (e.g., MRI, CT and PET) or other designated health services as specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services in the future from a provider other than that physician, his or her group practice, or another physician in his or her group practice. To date, CMS has not applied these disclosure requirements to radiation therapy referrals but could do so in the future.\nWhile we strive to ensure that our financial relationships with physicians and referral practices are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that violations will not occur. For example, we recently discovered an instance of non-compliance with the Stark Law at one of our clinics because the radiologists providing oversight for the imaging services we performed were not part of our group practice but were part of a separate corporate entity. We have since disclosed the incident to the appropriate regulatory authority. Incidents such as this could subject us to significant civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in government and private payer programs and requirements to refund amounts previously received from government and private payers.\nIn addition, expansion of our operations to new jurisdictions, or new interpretations of laws in our existing jurisdictions, could require structural and organizational modifications of our relationships with physicians to comply with that jurisdiction's laws. Such structural and organizational modifications could result in lower profitability and failure to achieve our growth objectives.\nCertain states have proposed statutory or regulatory enactments that would prohibit the use of the Stark Law \"in-office ancillary services\" exception for ICC physicians to obtain any financial benefit from radiation oncology and other DHS services even if they are part of a group practice. To date, only the state of Maryland has enacted such prohibition. If any of these state or similar federal proposed\nenactments are promulgated, this could have a material adverse impact on our ICC model and our business.\nIf a federal or state agency asserts a different position or enacts new laws or regulations regarding illegal payments under the Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, experience a significant reduction in our revenue or be excluded from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs.\nAny change in interpretations or enforcement of existing or new laws and regulations could subject our current business practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality, or could require us to make changes in our treatment centers, equipment, personnel, services, pricing or capital expenditure programs, which could increase our operating expenses and have a material adverse effect on our operations or reduce the demand for or profitability of our services.\nAdditionally, new federal or state laws may be enacted that would cause our relationships with our radiation oncologists or other physicians to become illegal or result in the imposition of penalties against us or our treatment centers. If any of our business arrangements with our radiation oncologists or other physicians in a position to make referrals of radiation therapy services were deemed to violate the federal anti-kickback statute or similar laws, or if new federal or state laws were enacted rendering these arrangements illegal, our business would be adversely affected.\nWe may encounter numerous business risks in identifying, acquiring and developing additional treatment centers, and may have difficulty operating and integrating those treatment centers.\nOver the past three years ended December 31, 2015, we have acquired 58 treatment centers, acquired 6 professional/other centers, developed 4 treatment centers, developed 2 professional/other center and transitioned 1 acquired professional/other centers to freestanding treatment centers. As part of our growth strategy, we expect to continue to add additional treatment centers in our existing and new local and international markets. When we acquire or develop additional treatment centers, we may:\n\u2022 be unable to make acquisitions on terms favorable to us or at all;\n\u2022 have difficulty identifying desirable targets or locations for treatment centers in suitable markets;\n\u2022 be unable to obtain adequate financing to fund our growth strategy;\n\u2022 be unable to successfully operate the treatment centers;\n\u2022 have difficulty integrating their operations and personnel;\n\u2022 be unable to retain physicians or key management personnel;\n\u2022 acquire treatment centers with unknown or contingent liabilities, including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws and regulations;\n\u2022 experience difficulties with transitioning or integrating the information systems of acquired treatment centers;\n\u2022 be unable to contract with third-party payers or attract patients to our treatment centers; and/or\n\u2022 experience losses and lower gross revenues and operating margins during the initial periods of operating our newly-developed treatment centers.\nLarger acquisitions could increase our potential exposure to business risks. Furthermore, integrating a new treatment center could be expensive and time consuming, and could disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management and other key personnel. In addition, we may incur significant transaction fees and expenses, including for potential transactions that are not consummated.\nWe may continue to explore acquisition opportunities outside of the United States when favorable opportunities are available to us. In addition to the risks set forth herein, foreign acquisitions involve unique risks including the particular economic, political and regulatory risks associated with the specific country, currency risks, the relative uncertainty regarding laws and regulations and the potential difficulty of integrating operations across different cultures and languages.\nWe plan to continue to develop new treatment centers in existing and new local markets, including international markets. We may not be able to structure economically beneficial arrangements in new markets as a result of healthcare laws applicable to such markets or otherwise. If these plans change for any reason or the anticipated schedules for opening and costs of development are revised by us, we may be negatively impacted. There can be no assurance that these planned treatment centers will be completed or that, if developed, will achieve sufficient patient volume to generate positive operating margins. If we are unable to timely and efficiently integrate a newly-developed treatment center, our business could suffer.\nWe cannot assure you that we will achieve the anticipated benefits from completed acquisitions or that we will achieve synergies and cost savings or benefits in connection with future acquisitions. In addition, many of the businesses that we have acquired and will acquire have financial statements that have been prepared by the management of such companies and have not been independently reviewed and audited. We cannot assure you that the financial statements of companies we have acquired or will acquire would not be materially different if such statements were audited. Finally, we cannot assure you that we will continue to acquire businesses at valuations consistent with our prior acquisitions or that we will complete acquisitions at all.\nAny failure to comply with regulations relating to privacy and security of patient information could subject us to significant penalties.\nThere are numerous federal and state laws and regulations addressing patient information privacy and security concerns, including state laws related to identity theft. In particular, the federal regulations issued under HIPAA contain provisions that:\n\u2022 protect individual privacy by limiting the uses and disclosures of patient information;\n\u2022 require notifications to individuals, and in certain cases to government agencies and the media, in the event of a breach of unsecured protected health information;\n\u2022 require the implementation of security safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of individually identifiable health information in electronic form; and\n\u2022 prescribe specific transaction formats and data code sets for certain electronic healthcare transactions.\nFurthermore, the Omnibus HIPAA Rule makes business associates directly obligated to adhere to the HIPAA Security Rule and certain provisions of the HIPAA Privacy and Breach Notification Rules, such that violations of these rules can be enforced by the government directly against the business associate.\nCompliance with these regulations requires substantial time and resources. If we fail to comply with the HIPAA regulations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and, for our employees, possible imprisonment. Furthermore, our facilities could be subject to a periodic audit by the federal government, and enforcement of HIPAA violations may occur by either federal agencies or state attorneys general. See the following risk factor for additional risks related to protecting patient information and security concerns.\nA cybersecurity attack or security breach could cause a loss of confidential data, give rise to remediation and other expenses, expose us to liability under HIPAA, consumer protection laws, common law or other theories, subject us to litigation and federal and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation, and otherwise be disruptive to our business.\nAs part of normal operations, the Company collects, processes and retains sensitive and confidential information. The Company is subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations regarding the use and disclosure of sensitive or confidential information, including HIPAA. Despite the security measures the Company has in place to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, its facilities and systems, and those of its third party providers, are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and human errors.\nOn November 13, 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation advised us that certain patient information (such as names, social security numbers, physicians' names, diagnoses and treatment information, and insurance information) was illegally obtained by an unauthorized third party who may have gained access to our business intelligence database. Upon learning of the intrusion, we immediately hired a leading forensics firm to support our investigation, assess our systems and bolster security.\nFollowing the data breach, the Company received notice that class action complaints had been filed against the Company and certain of its affiliates. The complaints allege, among other things, that the Company failed to take the necessary security precautions to protect patient information and prevent the data breach. In addition, the Company received a request for information regarding the data breach from the Office for Civil Rights as well as additional inquiries from State Attorneys General. While the Company has contingency plans and insurance coverage for certain potential liabilities relating to the intrusion, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all claims and liabilities. The Company cannot predict the ultimate resolution of these matters or estimate the amounts of, or ranges of, potential loss, if any, with respect to these proceedings. An adverse outcome in any of these matters could materially impact our business and financial position.\nFurther, in spite of our enhanced security measures, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to additional cyber-attacks or security breaches in the future. Such attacks or breaches could result in loss of protected health information or other data subject to privacy laws or disrupt our information technology systems or business. We continue to prioritize cybersecurity and the development of practices and controls to protect our systems. As cyber-threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. If we are subject to cyber-attacks or security breaches in the future, this could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nState law limitations and prohibitions on the corporate practice of medicine may materially harm our business and limit how we can operate.\nState governmental authorities regulate the medical industry and medical practices extensively. Many states have corporate practice of medicine laws which prohibit us from:\n\u2022 employing physicians;\n\u2022 practicing medicine, which, in some states, includes managing or operating a radiation treatment center;\n\u2022 certain types of fee arrangements with physicians;\n\u2022 owning or controlling equipment used in a medical practice;\n\u2022 setting fees charged for physician services;\n\u2022 controlling the content of physician advertisements and marketing;\n\u2022 billing and coding for services;\n\u2022 pursuing relationships with physicians and other referral sources; or\n\u2022 adding facilities and services.\nIn addition, many states impose limits on the tasks a physician may delegate to other staff members. We have administrative services agreements in states that prohibit the corporate practice of medicine. The laws governing the corporate practice of medicine vary from state to state, and regulatory authorities have broad discretion in the enforcement of such laws. We have structured our agreements and services in such states in a manner that we believe complies with the law and its interpretation by government authorities. If, however, we are deemed to be in violation of these laws, we could be required to restructure or terminate our agreements which could materially harm our business and limit how we operate. In the event the corporate practice of medicine laws of other states would adversely limit our ability to operate, it could prevent us from expanding into the particular state and impact our growth strategy.\nIn certain states we depend on administrative services agreements with professional corporations, including related party professional corporations, and if we are unable to continue to enter into them or they are terminated, we could be materially harmed.\nCertain states have laws prohibiting business corporations from employing physicians. Our treatment centers in those states operate through administrative services agreements with professional corporations that employ the radiation oncologists who provide professional services at the treatment centers in those states. In 2015, $141.2 million of our net patient service revenue was derived from administrative services agreements, as opposed to $858.9 million from all of our other centers. The professional corporations in these states are currently owned by certain of our directors, executive officers and equityholders, who are licensed to practice medicine in those states. As we enter into new states that will require an administrative services agreement, there can be no assurance that a related party professional corporation, or any professional corporation, will be willing or able to enter into an administrative services agreement. Furthermore, if we enter into an administrative services agreement with an unrelated party there could be an increased risk of differences arising or future termination. We cannot assure you that a professional corporation will not seek to terminate an agreement with us on any basis, including on the basis of state laws prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine, nor can we assure you that governmental authorities in those states will not seek termination of these arrangements on the same basis. While we have not been subject to such proceedings in the past, we could be materially harmed if any state governmental authorities or the professional corporations with which we have an administrative services agreement were to succeed in such a termination.\nOur business could be materially harmed by future interpretation or implementation of state laws regarding prohibitions on fee-splitting.\nMany states prohibit the splitting or sharing of fees between physicians and non-physicians, as well as between treating physicians and referral sources. These laws vary from state to state and are enforced by courts and regulatory agencies, each with broad discretion. Some states have interpreted certain types of fee arrangements in practice management agreements between entities and physicians as unlawful fee-splitting. We believe our arrangements with physicians comply in all material respects with the fee-splitting laws of the states in which we operate. Nevertheless, if government regulatory authorities were to disagree, we and our radiation oncologists could be subject to civil and criminal penalties, and we could be required to restructure or terminate our contractual and other\narrangements, which would result in a loss of revenue and could result in less input by us into the business decisions of such practices. In addition, expansion of our operations to other states with certain types of fee-splitting prohibitions may require structural and organizational modification to the form of relationships that we currently have with physicians, professional corporations and hospitals, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nIf we fail to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our treatment center operations, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.\nOur treatment center operations are subject to many laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels. These laws and regulations require that our treatment centers meet various licensing, certification and other requirements, including those relating to:\n\u2022 qualification of medical and support persons;\n\u2022 pricing of services by healthcare providers;\n\u2022 the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures;\n\u2022 clinic licensure and certificates of need;\n\u2022 maintenance and protection of records; and\n\u2022 environmental protection, health and safety, including the handling and disposal of medical waste.\nWhile we have structured our operations in a manner that we believe complies in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that government regulators will agree, given the breadth and complexity of such laws. If a government agency were to find that we are not in compliance with these laws, we could suffer civil or criminal penalties, including becoming the subject of cease and desist orders, rejection of the payment of our claims, the loss of our licenses to operate and our ability to participate in government or private healthcare programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nOur failure to comply with laws related to hazardous materials could materially harm us.\nOur treatment centers provide specialized treatment involving the use of radioactive material in the treatment of the lungs, prostate, breasts, cervix and other organs. The materials are obtained from, and, if not permanently placed in a patient or consumed, returned to a third-party provider of supplies to hospitals and other radiation therapy practices, which has the ultimate responsibility for its proper disposal. We, however, remain subject to state and federal laws regulating the protection of employees who may be exposed to hazardous material and regulating the proper handling, storage and disposal of that material. Although we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws, a violation of such laws, or the future enactment of more stringent laws or regulations, could subject us to liability, or require us to incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business may be harmed by technological and therapeutic changes.\nThe treatment of cancer patients is subject to potential significant technological and therapeutic changes. Future technological developments could render our equipment obsolete. We may incur significant costs in replacing or modifying equipment in which we have already made a substantial investment prior to the end of its anticipated useful life. In addition, there may be significant advances in other cancer treatment methods, such as chemotherapy, surgery, biological therapy or in cancer prevention techniques, which could reduce demand or even eliminate the need for the radiation therapy services we provide.\nChanges in medical treatment guidelines or recommendations and technological innovations may adversely affect our business.\nThere are numerous options that a cancer patient can undergo for treatment. There are also a number of regulatory bodies, research panels and formal guidelines that can influence or even dictate patients, payers and physicians in the course of action that a patient determines to take for his or her particular form of cancer. For example, in May 2012, the U.S. Preventative Task Force finalized its recommendation against prostate-specific antigen screening and the National Cancer Institute suggested changes in treatment patterns for prostate cancer away from definitive treatment and towards \"watchful waiting\" or \"active surveillance.\" Both of these bodies' proclamations negatively impacted the volume of prostate cancer treatments nationally.\nTechnological innovations have improved our ability to deliver higher and more accurate radiation doses to some of the pathologies we see in our patients, making the treatment courses shorter. More specifically, the number of fractions needed to deliver the desired biological effect is shorter. As an example, patients with brain metastasis until recently received treatment aimed at the whole brain, a treatment relatively effective but with known toxic effects. We are currently treating some of those patients with much fewer fractions that are no longer targeting the whole brain, but just the lesions in the brain themselves. Another example is the relatively new medical understanding that we can treat some breast cancer with a lower number of fractions and achieve similar results. These new treatment methods for breast cancer result in fewer fractions and at the same time make those treatments more friendly and practical for a relatively large contingent of patients who in the past chose alternative treatments or chose to directly forgo the treatment because of personal logistics. As a result, such technological innovations have negatively impacted our operating income. Other innovations have had, and future innovations could have, a similar effect.\nEfforts to regulate the construction, acquisition or expansion of healthcare treatment centers could prevent us from developing or acquiring additional treatment centers or other facilities or renovating our existing treatment centers.\nMany states have enacted certificate of need laws which require prior approval for the construction, acquisition or expansion of healthcare treatment centers. In giving approval, these states consider the need for additional or expanded healthcare treatment centers or services. In certain states in which we operate, certificates of need must be obtained for capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount, changes in capacity or services offered and various other matters. Other states in which we now or may in the future operate may also require certificates of need under certain circumstances not currently applicable to us. We may not be able to obtain the certificates of need or other required approvals for ongoing, additional or expanded treatment centers or services in the future. In addition, at the time we acquire a treatment center, we may agree to replace equipment or expand the acquired treatment center. If we are unable to obtain required approvals, we may not be able to acquire additional treatment centers or other facilities, expand acquired treatment centers, expand the healthcare services we provide at these treatment centers, or replace equipment.\nWe are exposed to local business risks in different countries, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have significant operations in foreign countries. Currently, we operate through 28 legal entities in Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, The Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala and Mexico, in addition to our operations in the United States. Our offshore operations are subject to risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n\u2022 new and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, which may conflict with U.S. laws;\n\u2022 local economic conditions;\n\u2022 potential staffing difficulties and labor disputes;\n\u2022 increased costs of transportation or shipping;\n\u2022 credit risk and financial conditions of government, commercial and patient payers;\n\u2022 nationalization of private enterprises by foreign governments;\n\u2022 potential imposition of restrictions on investments;\n\u2022 potential restrictions on conversion or repatriation of funds, payments of dividends and other financial options integral to our investments and operations;\n\u2022 potential declines in government and/or private payer reimbursement amounts for our services;\n\u2022 potentially adverse tax consequences, including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n\u2022 foreign currency exchange restrictions and fluctuations; and\n\u2022 local political and social conditions, including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions and political or social instability in certain countries.\nWe may not be successful in developing and implementing policies and strategies to address the foregoing factors in a timely and effective manner at each location where we do business. Consequently, the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our international operations or upon our financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, our international operations require us to comply with a number of U.S. and international regulations. For example, we must comply with U.S. economic sanctions and export control laws in connection with exports of products and services, and we must comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"). The FCPA prohibits U.S. companies or their agents and employees from providing anything of value to a foreign official or agent thereof for the purposes of influencing any act or decision of these individuals in their official capacity to help obtain or retain business, direct business to any person or corporate entity or obtain any unfair advantage. Any failure by us to ensure that our employees and agents comply with the FCPA, economic sanctions and export controls, and applicable laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial penalties or restrictions on our ability to conduct business in certain foreign jurisdictions, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nLocal governments may take actions that may be adverse to our interests and our business. We have significant operations in Argentina and any such development could have a material adverse effect on our international operations or upon our financial condition and results of operations. Our international subsidiaries accounted for $117.9 million, or 10.9%, of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly impact our results of operations and may significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.\nSome of our operations are conducted by subsidiaries in foreign countries. The results of the operations and the financial position of these subsidiaries are reported in the relevant foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. The main currency to which we are exposed, besides the U.S. dollar, is the Argentine peso. The exchange rate between the Argentine peso and the U.S. dollar in recent years has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future. A depreciation of this currency against the U.S. dollar will decrease the U.S. dollar equivalent of the amounts derived from\nthese operations reported in our consolidated financial statements and an appreciation of this currency will result in a corresponding increase in such amounts. In addition, currency fluctuations may affect the comparability of our results of operations between financial periods.\nWe incur currency exchange risk whenever we enter into a transaction using a currency other than the local currency of the transacting entity. Given the volatility of exchange rates, there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively manage our currency exchange risks or that any volatility in currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operations in Argentina expose us to the changing economic, legal, and political environment in that country, including changing regulations governing the repatriation of cash generated from our operations in Argentina.\nThe current economic, legal, and political environment in Argentina and recent devaluations of the Argentinian peso have created increased instability for foreign operations in Argentina. The Argentinian government is currently attempting to address the current high rate of inflation and the continuing currency devaluation pressure. Fiscal and monetary expansion in Argentina has led to devaluations of the Argentinian peso. There can be no assurances that our Argentinian operations will not expose us to the loss of liquidity, foreign exchange losses or other potential financial consequences.\nOur information systems are critical to our business and a failure of those systems could materially harm us.\nWe depend on our ability to store, retrieve, process and manage a significant amount of information, and to provide our treatment centers with efficient and effective accounting and scheduling systems. Our information systems require maintenance and upgrading to meet our needs, which could significantly increase our administrative expenses. We are currently upgrading multiple systems and migrating to other systems within our organization.\nFurthermore, any system failure that causes an interruption in service or availability of our systems could adversely affect operations or delay the collection of revenues. Even though we have implemented network security measures, our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering. The occurrence of any of these events could result in interruptions, delays, the loss or corruption of data, or cessations in the availability of systems, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and harm our business reputation.\nThe performance of our information technology and systems is critical to our business operations. Our information systems are essential to a number of critical areas of our operations, including:\n\u2022 accounting and financial reporting;\n\u2022 billing and collecting accounts;\n\u2022 coding and compliance;\n\u2022 clinical systems;\n\u2022 medical records and document storage;\n\u2022 inventory management;\n\u2022 negotiating, pricing and administering managed care contracts and supply contracts; and\n\u2022 monitoring quality of care and collecting data on quality measures necessary for full Medicare payment updates.\nAny failure of our information technology and systems could disrupt these operations, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nIf we fail to effectively and timely implement electronic health record systems, our operations could be adversely affected.\nAs required by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the DHHS has developed and is implementing an incentive payment program for eligible healthcare professionals that adopt and meaningfully use certified electronic health record (\"EHR\") technology. If our future treatment centers are unable to meet the requirements for participation in the incentive payment program, we will not be eligible to receive incentive payments that could offset some of the costs of implementing EHR systems. Further, eligible healthcare professionals that fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology will be subject to reduced payments from Medicare.\nOur financial results may suffer if we have to write-off goodwill or other intangible assets.\nA significant portion of our total assets consist of goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, accounted for approximately 50.4% of the total assets on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. We may not realize the value of our goodwill or other intangible assets. We expect to engage in additional transactions that will result in our recognition of additional goodwill or other intangible assets. We evaluate on a regular basis whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that all or a portion of the carrying amount of goodwill or other intangible assets may no longer be recoverable, and is therefore impaired. Under current accounting rules, any determination that impairment has occurred would require us to write-off the impaired portion of our goodwill or the unamortized portion of our intangible assets, resulting in a charge to our earnings. We have written off significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets in the past. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we wrote-off approximately $228.3 million in goodwill as a result of our interim impairment testing of our goodwill. Any future write-off could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have addressed previous material weaknesses with respect to our internal controls and have identified additional material weaknesses in our internal controls, which could, if not sufficiently remediated, result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe have experienced material weaknesses with respect to our internal controls in the past. As disclosed in Item 9A, management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to the following areas:\n\u2022 have a sufficient complement of personnel with an appropriate level of knowledge, experience, and oversight commensurate with our financial reporting requirements to ensure proper selection and application of GAAP;\n\u2022 design and maintain adequate procedures or effective review and approval controls over the accurate recording of revenues and related accounts receivables in MDLLC, our Latin America operations;\n\u2022 design and maintain adequate procedures or effective review and approval controls over the accurate reporting, including the use of appropriate technical accounting expertise, when recording complex or non-routine transactions such as those involving self-insured medical malpractice programs, purchase accounting, embedded derivatives, accounting and reporting for the SFRO acquisition (including classification of noncontrolling interests), CPPIB transactions and related embedded derivatives, foreign currency translations and functional currency determinations for foreign operations;\n\u2022 design and maintain adequate procedures or effective controls related to our regulatory compliance monitoring procedures and oversight over compliance and regulatory affairs matters; specifically, the scope of our compliance work programs and procedures did not address all relevant risks to the organization, including procedures to test for the medical necessity;\n\u2022 design and maintain adequate procedures or effective controls to test that the meaningful use criteria was successfully met and maintained in order for the Company to recognize EHR incentive income under the gain contingency model as prescribed by ASC 450;\n\u2022 design and maintain procedures or effective controls to ensure effective communication and coordination within the Company on compliance related matters;\n\u2022 design and maintain adequate oversight over the accounting department of foreign operations including internal controls required to mitigate risks of material misstatement.\n\u2022 design and maintain procedures or effective controls to ensure adequate oversight over the information technology (\"IT\") organization to maintain effective information technology general controls (access and program change controls)which are required to support automated controls and IT functionality; and\nintegrate and maintain (i) appropriate segregation of duties over cash, (ii) adequate access controls with regard to financial applications, and (iii) adequate controls over the processing of expenditures, including payroll expense. Each of these items is specific to the integration of SFRO.\nThe above material weaknesses required a restatement of certain of our prior financial statements. While we have taken, and will continue to take, steps to remediate our internal control weaknesses, there can be no assurance that such steps will be effective or that we will not identify control deficiencies in the future.\nIf our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results, or report them within the required timeframes, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results again in the future, which could cause investors and others to lose confidence in our financial statements, limit our ability to raise capital and could adversely affect our reputation, results of operations and consolidated financial condition.\nA significant number of our treatment centers are concentrated in certain states, particularly Florida, which makes us sensitive to regulatory, economic and other conditions in those states.\nA significant number of our treatment centers are concentrated in Florida, California and North Carolina. This concentration makes us particularly sensitive to regulatory requirements in those locations, including those related to false and improper claims, anti-kickback laws, self-referral laws, fee-splitting, corporate practice of medicine, antitrust, licensing and certificates of need, as well as economic and other conditions which could impact us. If our treatment centers in these states are adversely affected by changes in regulatory, economic or other conditions, our revenue and profitability may decline.\nOur operations in Florida and other areas could be disrupted or damaged by hurricanes and other natural disasters.\nOur treatment centers in Florida and California, among others, are subject to natural disasters, such as hurricanes and earthquakes, which could significantly disrupt our operations, causing an adverse effect on our business and financial results. While we carry property damage and business interruption insurance on our facilities, there can be no assurance that it would be adequate to cover all such losses.\nWe have potential conflicts of interest relating to our related party transactions which could harm our business.\nWe have potential conflicts of interest relating to existing agreements we have with certain of our directors, executive officers and equityholders. In 2015, for example we paid an aggregate of $16.8 million under certain of our related party agreements, including leases, and malpractice insurance premiums and we received $66.9 million pursuant to our other services agreements with related parties. Potential conflicts of interest can exist if a related party has to make a decision that has different implications for us and the related party. If a dispute arises in connection with any of these agreements, if not resolved satisfactorily to us, our business could be harmed. These agreements include:\n\u2022 administrative services agreements with professional corporations that are owned by certain of our directors, executive officers and equityholders; and\n\u2022 leases we have entered into with entities owned by certain of our directors, executive officers and equityholders.\nRelated party transactions between us and any related party are subject to approval by our Audit Committee or our Board of Directors, and disputes are handled by the Board of Directors. There can be no assurance that the above or any future conflicts of interest will be resolved in our favor. If not resolved in our favor, such conflicts could harm our business. For a further description of our related party transactions, see \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.\"\nIn recent years, accreditation of facilities and the establishment of a national error reporting database have been under consideration.\nThe Chairman of the ACR called for the required accreditation of all facilities which bill Medicare for advanced medical imaging and radiation oncology services, including those in hospitals at a congressional hearing on medical radiation. Federal legislation was also introduced in March 2013, which requires certain personnel furnishing medical imaging examinations or radiation therapy to obtain state licensure and certification from certain approved certification organizations, and directs the DHHS to establish a program for designating and publishing a list of such certification organizations.\nOf our 145 U.S. treatment centers, 114 have received or are in process of receiving ACR or ACRO accreditation. In addition to a deep physics infrastructure and internal maintenance department, we have recently begun to utilize Gamma Function as a broad application radiation safety monitoring tool to minimize potential errors in our radiation therapy treatments. While we continue to improve upon safety measures aimed at minimizing errors in radiation therapy treatment in accordance with our internal protocols as well as the mandates of organizations like ACR and ACRO, we cannot assure you that any further critical press and government scrutiny will not lead to increased regulation. Additionally we cannot assure you that the cost of complying with any new regulations will not be substantive, that the negative publicity concerning these errors will not adversely affect our business, or that these types of errors will not occur with our services.\nOur financial results could be adversely affected by claims brought against our facilities, the increasing costs of professional liability insurance and by successful malpractice claims.\nWe could be subject to litigation relating to our business practices, including claims and legal actions by patients and others in the ordinary course of business alleging malpractice, product liability or other legal theories. We are also exposed to the risk of professional liability and other claims against us and our radiation oncologists and other physicians and professionals arising out of patient medical treatment at our treatment centers. Our risk exposure as it relates to our non-radiation oncology physicians could be greater than with our radiation oncologists to the extent such non-radiation\noncology physicians are engaged in diagnostic activities. For a discussion of current pending material litigation against us, see \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\" Malpractice claims, if successful, could result in substantial damage awards which might exceed the limits of any applicable insurance coverage. Insurance against losses of this type can be expensive and insurance premiums may increase in the near future. Insurance rates vary from state to state, by physician specialty and other factors. The rising costs of insurance premiums, as well as successful malpractice claims against us or one of our physicians, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nIt is also possible that our excess liability and other insurance coverage will not continue to be available at acceptable costs or on favorable terms. In addition, our insurance does not cover all potential liabilities arising from governmental fines and penalties, indemnification agreements and certain other uninsurable losses. For example, from time to time we agree to indemnify third parties, such as hospitals and clinical laboratories, for various claims that may not be covered by insurance. As a result, we may become responsible for substantial damage awards that are uninsured.\nIf payment for claims exceed actuarially determined estimates or are not covered by insurance, or if reinsurers, if any, fail to meet their obligations, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial debt could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe have $1.1 billion of total debt outstanding as of December 31, 2015. Our high level of debt could have adverse effects on our business and financial condition. Specifically, our high level of debt could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022 making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt;\n\u2022 limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022 requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes;\n\u2022 increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022 limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;\n\u2022 placing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022 increasing our cost of borrowing.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on and to refinance our indebtedness depends on and is subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors beyond our control, including the availability of financing in the international banking and capital markets. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt, to refinance our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to meet our debt obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we will need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, which could cause us to default on our debt obligations and impair our liquidity. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations.\nThere is substantial doubt that we can continue as a going concern.\nSubject to certain qualifications, the credit agreement governing our term loan and the indenture governing our notes, each as currently in effect, require us to receive, subject to certain important qualifications set forth therein, (1) no later than September 10, 2016, net cash proceeds from the issuance or sale of 21C's capital stock or from other equity investments in an aggregate amount of at least $25.0 million (the \"First Capital Event\"), (2) no later than November 30, 2016, additional net cash proceeds from the issuance or sale of 21C's capital stock or from other equity investments and/or sales of assets (which sale transactions must be deleveraging transactions on a pro forma basis) in an aggregate amount of at least $25.0 million (or a lesser amount such that when combined with the proceeds from the First Capital Event, the total amount is not less than $50.0 million) (the \"Second Capital Event\") and (3) no later than March 31, 2017, additional net cash proceeds from the issuance or sale of 21C's capital stock or from other equity investments and/or sales of assets (which sale transactions must be deleveraging transactions on a pro forma basis) in an aggregate amount of at least the lesser of (A) $75.0 million (or a lesser amount such that when combined with the proceeds from the First Capital Event and the Second Capital Event, the total amount is not less than $125.0 million), and (B) an amount such that, after giving effect to such issuance or sale of capital stock or other equity investments and/or sales of assets, 21C's cash and cash equivalents plus unused revolving loan commitments equals at least $120.0 million and 21C's consolidated leverage ratio is not greater than 6.4 to 1.00 (the \"Third Capital Event\" and together with the First Capital Event and the Second Capital Event, the \"Capital Events\" and each, a \"Capital Event\"). We are also required to comply with a minimum liquidity covenant of an amount not less than $40.0 million after the completion of the First Capital Event, to be tested monthly prior to the completion of the Third Capital Event and quarterly thereafter. Our failure to satisfy such requirements could result in an event of default under our credit agreement or indenture, which could result in the debt thereunder being accelerated. As we do not have firm commitments to obtain the required equity or dispose of assets in place, and we may not be able to maintain the required levels of liquidity, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\nIn the event we are unable to meet the foregoing requirements, we will need to identify alternative options, such as a debt refinancing, a sale of the Company or other strategic transaction, or a transformative transaction, such as a possible restructuring or reorganization of the Company's operations. In addition, the perception that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may negatively and materially impact our existing and future business relationships, and others may choose not to deal with us at all due to concerns about our ability to meet our contractual obligations.\nDespite current indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage.\nWe have the right to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of our $610 million term loan facility (the \"2015 Term Facility\") and our $125 million revolving credit facility (the \"2015 Revolving Credit Facility\" and together with the 2015 Term Facility, the \"2015 Credit Facilities\") and the indentures governing our notes restrict, but do not in all circumstances, prohibit us from doing so. Under the instruments governing our debt, we are permitted to incur additional indebtedness under certain circumstances. Any additional debt may be governed by indentures or other instruments containing covenants that could place restrictions on the operation of our business and the execution of our business strategy in addition to the restrictions on our business already contained in the agreements governing our existing debt. Because any decision to issue debt securities or enter into new debt facilities will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of any future debt financings and whether we may be required to accept unfavorable terms for any such financings.\nOur 2015 Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our notes impose significant operating and financial restrictions on our Company and our subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities.\nOur 2015 Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our notes impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022 incur additional indebtedness or enter into sale and leaseback obligations;\n\u2022 pay certain dividends or make certain distributions on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022 make certain investments or other restricted payments;\n\u2022 place restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us;\n\u2022 engage in transactions with equityholders or affiliates;\n\u2022 sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies; and\n\u2022 create liens.\nAs a result of these covenants and restrictions, we will be limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or other financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.\nThe interests of our equity securityholders may conflict with your interests.\nVestar indirectly controls approximately 80% of the Class A voting equity units of 21st Century Oncology Investments, LLC (\"21CI\"), which in turn controls us, and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (\"CPPIB\" or the \"Majority Preferred Holders\") controls 100% of our Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock (\"Series A Preferred Stock\") of 21CI. In addition, pursuant to our Second Amended and Restated Securityholders Agreement (the \"Amended Securityholders Agreement\"), Vestar and CPPIB are able to appoint a majority of our Board of Directors. As a result, Vestar and CPPIB effectively have control over major decisions regardless of whether creditors believe that any such decisions are in their best interests. The interests of Vestar and CPPIB may conflict with the interests of creditors or with each other. Vestar and CPPIB may have an incentive to increase the value of their investments or cause us to distribute funds at the expense of our financial condition and affect our ability to service our debt. In addition, Vestar and CPPIB may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that they believe could enhance their equity investments even though such transactions might involve risks to you as a noteholder.", "PERMNO": 90237, "SIC": 8090, "TIC": "21ST10"}
