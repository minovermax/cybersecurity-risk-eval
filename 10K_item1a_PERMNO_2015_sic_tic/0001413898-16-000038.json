Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors are based on management\u2019s current knowledge and estimates of factors affecting the Company\u2019s operations, both known and unknown. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking information as actual results may differ materially from the possible risks and outcomes discussed herein. In addition, a number of other factors (those identified elsewhere in this document and others, both known and unknown) may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.\nA. H. Belo\u2019s newspapers operate in highly competitive media markets, and the Company\u2019s ability to generate revenue depends on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s strategy to promote new and existing products.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses operate in highly competitive media markets. A. H. Belo\u2019s newspapers compete for advertising and circulation revenue with other newspapers, websites, digital applications, magazines, television, radio, direct mail and other media. The continued expansion of digital media and communications, particularly social media, mobile applications and the proliferation of tablet and mobile devices has increased some consumers\u2019 preferences to receive all or part of their news and information digitally. Websites such as craigslist.org, monster.com and cars.com provide a cost efficient platform for reaching wide but targeted audiences for classified advertising. Websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Google and Yahoo! are successful in gathering national, local and entertainment news and information from multiple sources and attracting a broad readership base.\nHistorically, newspaper publishing was viewed as a cost-effective method of delivery for various forms of advertising to a large audience. The continued development and deployment of new technologies and greater competition from other media increases the challenge to the Company to provide competitive offerings to retain its print, as well as digital, advertisers and subscribers.\nA. H. Belo\u2019s ability to stabilize advertising and circulation revenue through price and volume increases may be affected by competition from other forms of media and other publications available in the Company\u2019s various markets, declining consumer spending on discretionary items like newspapers, decreasing amounts of free time and declining frequency of regular newspaper buying among certain demographic groups. The Company may also incur higher costs competing for paid circulation, and if the Company is not able to compete effectively, revenue may decline and the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nPurchasing practices of national advertisers could negatively impact the Company\u2019s pricing and ability to up-sell other products, which could result in lower revenues.\nMany national advertisers which place advertising in the Company\u2019s newspapers are centralizing purchasing functions and streamlining the buying and negotiating process. This could result in the commoditization of certain advertising products, which limits the Company\u2019s ability to promote its position in the market, the customer service value of its relationship with the advertiser, and the benefits of its suite of products, including the Company\u2019s ability to up-sell other products. This also may put the Company in competition with other advertising companies that are able to offer lower prices for a larger geographical area than the Company covers. Accordingly, the Company could experience a decline in pricing which could result in lower revenues.\nDecreases in circulation may adversely affect A. H. Belo\u2019s advertising and circulation revenue.\nA. H. Belo\u2019s newspapers, and the newspaper industry as a whole, are challenged to maintain and grow print circulation volume. To the extent circulation volume declines cannot be offset by rate increases the Company will realize lower circulation revenue. Further, circulation volume declines could also result in lower rates and volumes for advertising revenue.\nThe expansion of programmatic advertising could result in lower realization of advertising revenue sold by the Company\u2019s news and entertainment websites.\nDigital marketing services are relatively new to business customers. Barriers to entering this industry are low and many competitors offering advertising services on traditional advertising platforms are seeking to gain market share, particularly through programmatic exchanges. As this industry expands, purchasing and selling of advertisement on exchanges is expected to result in lower costs of advertising which in-turn could be passed on to businesses customers. Such events could result in lower profit realization for digital advertising revenue within the Company\u2019s news and entertainment websites as it competes with exchange platforms for advertising dollars.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nA. H. Belo Corporation 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe growth and profitability of the Company\u2019s marketing services businesses are largely dependent on acceptance by local businesses and the recruitment and retention of key employees.\nMarketing services offerings are rapidly evolving as business customers seek quantifiable results to measure the effectiveness of their advertising spending. The Company\u2019s marketing services customers primarily represent mid-sized businesses varying degrees of knowledge and familiarity with online marketing and advertising campaigns. The success of the Company\u2019s marketing service offerings is dependent on education of these customers on the benefits of these services to their businesses. Challenges may include the accuracy or perceived accuracy of metrics provided and the ability of the customer to properly interpret the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns against benchmarks that may not be reliable.\nIncreasing the Company\u2019s client base and achieving broader market acceptance of its suite of cross-channel, interactive marketing solutions will depend on the ability of sales and marketing teams and their capabilities to obtain new clients as well as sell additional products and services to existing clients. Competition is fierce for direct sales professionals with the skills and technical knowledge that is required, and the Company may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future. The ability to achieve significant future revenue growth will depend on the success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of direct sales professionals. New and planned hires require significant training and time before sales teams become fully productive, and may not become as productive as quickly as anticipated. The growth prospects will be harmed if efforts to expand, train and retain the direct sales team do not generate a corresponding significant increase in revenue.\nThe Company\u2019s potential inability to successfully execute cost control measures could result in total operating costs that are greater than expected.\nThe primary costs of the Company\u2019s operations include employee compensation and benefits, followed by distribution costs, newsprint and other production materials and technology costs. The Company has taken steps to lower its costs through selling or discontinuing production of unprofitable operations and products, reducing personnel and restructuring employee benefits and implementing general cost control measures. Although the Company continues its cost control efforts, the Company may be unable to match revenue declines with offsetting cost reductions.\nCertain operating costs may not fluctuate directly with the changes in revenue volumes, which could result in lower margins if advertising and circulation volumes decline. The Company could also experience inflationary pressures from newsprint and other suppliers and be unable to generate additional revenue or additional cost reductions to offset these inflationary pressures. The Company utilizes outside service providers to distribute its newspapers, and certain preprint advertising is distributed through the mail. Higher fuel costs or higher postage rates could result in higher direct costs incurred by the Company to distribute its products.\nIncreasing cost of healthcare benefits offered to employees may require the Company to evaluate the scope of benefits offered and the method in which health care benefits are delivered. Competition for qualified personnel may require the Company to spend more on compensation costs, including employee benefits, to attract and retain its workforce.\nThe Company may not be able to pass on to customers these potential cost increases given the significant competition for advertising dollars and the ability of customers to obtain their news from other media at a low cost. If the Company does not achieve expected savings or if operating costs increase due to the creation and development of new products or otherwise, total operating costs may be greater than anticipated.\nThe Company believes appropriate steps are being taken to control costs. However, if the Company is not successful in matching revenue declines with corresponding cost reductions, the Company\u2019s ability to generate future profits could be affected.\nThe sufficiency of the Company\u2019s liquidity is dependent upon meeting future financial goals.\nAlthough the Company\u2019s cash holdings are more than sufficient to meet foreseeable operating needs, the Company must achieve expected financial goals. Unplanned events such as significant pension plan contributions, tax obligations, significant loss of revenue, unprofitable operations or deterioration of collections of receivables, could accelerate the use of the Company\u2019s cash balances. The Company\u2019s ability to raise financial capital in the future may be hindered due to uncertainty regarding newspaper industry\u2019s prospective performance. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, if and when needed, the Company may be forced to sell assets at below-market prices to sustain its operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nA. H. Belo Corporation 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThere can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s product and service initiatives will be successful.\nThe Company has introduced new product and service initiatives designed to grow advertising and market services revenue and to respond to challenges of maintaining revenue in existing markets. These initiatives may not be successful for advertisers, may not be marketable or profitable and could result in unprofitable financial performance.\nSignificant turnover of key employees could expose the Company to loss.\nA. H. Belo relies on the efforts of its senior executive officers and other management. The Company is located in a strong economic region of the United States with low unemployment and strong competition for senior management personnel. Over the last few years, the Company has realized significant turnover of key executives and management from cost cutting measures, department restructurings and attrition. The success of the Company\u2019s businesses depends heavily on its ability to successfully execute the required responsibilities of these roles as well as the Company\u2019s ability to retain current management and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. The loss of key personnel results in additional recruiting and training costs to the Company. Further, the exposure for loss to the Company and the potential delay of operations is elevated until the employee has sufficient knowledge commensurate with their assigned duties.\nMarket conditions could increase the funding requirements associated with the Company\u2019s pension plans.\nThe Company is the sole sponsor of A. H. Belo Pension Plans I and II (collectively, the \u201cA. H. Belo Pension Plans\u201d) and is required to meet certain pension funding requirements as established under the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d). Instability in global and domestic capital markets may result in low returns on the assets contributed to the A. H. Belo Pension Plans. Additionally, low yields on corporate bonds may decrease the discount rate, resulting in a higher funding obligation. Although legislation was enacted into law in 2012 which provided limited funding relief, these conditions could materially increase the funding requirements associated with the A. H. Belo Pension Plans, which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s liquidity and financial condition.\nAdverse results from new litigation or governmental proceedings or investigations could adversely affect A. H. Belo\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, A. H. Belo and its subsidiaries are subject to litigation, governmental proceedings and investigations. Adverse determinations in any such matters could require A. H. Belo to make monetary payments or result in other sanctions or findings that could affect adversely the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA. H. Belo\u2019s directors and executive officers have significant combined voting power and significant influence over its management and affairs.\nA. H. Belo directors and executive officers hold approximately 48 percent of the voting power of the Company\u2019s outstanding voting stock as of December 31, 2015. A. H. Belo\u2019s Series A common stock has one vote per share and Series B common stock has 10 votes per share. Except for certain extraordinary corporate transactions, generally all matters to be voted on by A. H. Belo\u2019s shareholders must be approved by a majority of the voting power of the Company\u2019s outstanding voting stock, voting as a single class. Certain extraordinary corporate transactions, such as a merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets, dissolution of the Company, the alteration, amendment, or repeal of A. H. Belo\u2019s bylaws by shareholders and certain amendments to A. H. Belo\u2019s certificate of incorporation, require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of the outstanding voting stock, voting as a single class. Accordingly, A. H. Belo\u2019s directors and executive officers will have significant influence over the Company\u2019s management and affairs and over all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions. This ownership may limit other shareholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, A. H. Belo may take actions that some shareholders do not view as beneficial.\n\u2003\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nA. H.
