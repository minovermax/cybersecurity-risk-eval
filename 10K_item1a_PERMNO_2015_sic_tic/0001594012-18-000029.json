{"cik": "1594012", "company": "Investors Bancorp, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe risks set forth below, in addition to the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition to the risks set forth below and the other risks described in this annual report, there may also be additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. As a result, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nInvestors Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the NJDBI, our chartering authority, by the FDIC, as insurer of our deposits, and by the CFPB, with respect to consumer protection laws. As a bank holding company, Investors Bancorp is subject to regulation and oversight by the Federal Reserve Board. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a bank and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the requirement for additional capital, the imposition of restrictions on our operations, restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and make other capital distributions to shareholders, restrictions on our ability to repurchase shares, the classification of our assets and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, compliance and privacy issues, Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering compliance, and approval of merger transactions. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, could have a material impact on Investors Bank, Investors Bancorp and our operations.\nThe potential exists for additional Federal or state laws and regulations regarding capital requirements, lending and funding practices and liquidity standards, and bank regulatory agencies are expected to remain active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, including the potential issuance of formal enforcement orders. New laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes, along with negative developments in the financial industry and the domestic and international credit markets, could increase our costs of regulatory compliance and may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability.\nIf the bank regulators impose limitations on our commercial real estate lending activities, our earnings, dividend paying capacity and/or ability to repurchase shares could be adversely affected.\nIn 2006, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (collectively, the \u201cAgencies\u201d) issued joint guidance entitled \u201cConcentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices\u201d (the \u201cCRE Guidance\u201d). Although the CRE Guidance did not establish specific lending limits, it provides that a bank\u2019s commercial real estate lending exposure may receive increased supervisory scrutiny where total non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by apartment buildings, investor commercial real estate and construction and land loans, represent 300% or more of an institution\u2019s total risk-based capital and the outstanding balance of the commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the preceding 36 months. Our level of non-owner occupied commercial real estate equaled 420% of Bank total risk-based capital at December 31, 2017 and our commercial real estate loan portfolio increased by 62% during the preceding 36 months.\nIn December 2015, the Agencies released a new statement on prudent risk management for commercial real estate lending (the \u201c2015 Statement\u201d). In the 2015 Statement, the Agencies express concerns about easing commercial real estate underwriting standards, direct financial institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise risk management practices to identify, measure and monitor lending risks, and indicate that the Agencies will continue \u201cto pay special attention\u201d to commercial real estate lending activities and concentrations going forward. If the FDIC, the Bank\u2019s primary federal regulator were to impose restrictions on the amount of commercial real estate loans we can hold in our portfolio, or require higher capital ratios as a result of the level of commercial real estate loans we hold, our earnings, dividend paying capacity and/or ability to repurchase shares would be adversely affected.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate economic conditions. If actual results differ significantly from our assumptions, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance. Material additions to our allowance would materially decrease our net income. Our allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2017 of $231.0 million was 1.15% of total loans and 157.46% of non-performing loans at such date.\nIn addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. A material increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we intend to continue to increase our commercial originations, our credit risk will increase.\nAt December 31, 2017, our portfolio of multi-family, commercial real estate, C&I and construction loans totaled $14.39 billion, or 71.6% of our total loans. We intend to continue to increase our originations of multi-family, commercial real estate, C&I and construction loans, which generally have more risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Since repayment of commercial loans depends on the successful management and operation of the borrower\u2019s properties or related businesses, repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market, local economy or the management of the business or property. In addition, our commercial borrowers may have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. Because we plan to continue to increase our originations of these loans, it may be necessary to increase the level of our allowance for loan losses because of the increased risk characteristics associated with these types of loans. Any such increase to our allowance for loan losses would adversely affect our earnings.\nSignificant portions of our multi-family loan portfolio and commercial real estate portfolio and nearly all of our C&I loan portfolio are unseasoned. It is difficult to judge the future performance of unseasoned loans.\nOur multi-family loan portfolio has increased to $7.80 billion at December 31, 2017 from $3.99 billion at December 31, 2013. Our commercial real estate portfolio has increased to $4.55 billion at December 31, 2017 from $2.51 billion at December 31, 2013. Our C&I loan portfolio has increased to $1.63 billion at December 31, 2017 from $268.4 million at December 31, 2013. Consequently, a large portion of our multi-family loans and commercial real estate loans and nearly all of our C&I loans are unseasoned. It is difficult to assess the future performance of these recently originated loans because of their relatively limited payment history from which to judge future collectability, especially in the economic environment since 2013. These loans may experience higher delinquency or charge-off levels than our historical loan portfolio experience, which could adversely affect our future performance.\nOur liabilities reprice faster than our assets and future increases in interest rates will reduce our profits.\nOur ability to make a profit largely depends on our net interest income, which could be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities; and the interest expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.\nThe interest income we earn on our assets and the interest expense we pay on our liabilities are generally fixed for a contractual period of time. Our liabilities generally have shorter contractual maturities than our assets. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility, because market interest rates change over time. In a period of rising interest rates, the interest income earned on our assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest paid on our liabilities. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Management of Market Risk.\u201d\nIn addition, changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. Increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and/or make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable-rate loans. In addition, an increase in interest rates cause decreased prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. Conversely, a reduction in interest rates causes increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities as borrowers refinance their debt to reduce their borrowing costs. This creates reinvestment risk, which is the risk that we may not be able to reinvest the funds from faster prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates we earned on the prepaid loans or securities.\nChanges in interest rates also affect the current market value of our interest-earning securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2017, the fair value of our total securities portfolio was $3.81 billion. Unrealized net losses on securities available-for-sale are reported as a separate component of equity. To the extent interest rates increase and the value of our available-for-sale portfolio decreases, our stockholders\u2019 equity will be adversely affected.\nWe evaluate interest rate sensitivity using models that estimate the change in our net portfolio value over a range of interest rate scenarios. The economic value of equity analysis is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts. At December 31, 2017, in the event of a 200 basis point increase in interest rates, whereby rates increase evenly over a twelve-month period, and assuming management took no action to mitigate the effect of such change, the model projects that we would experience a 6.5% or $44.1 million decrease in net interest income and 8.1% or $377.7 million decrease in economic value of equity.\nHistorically low interest rates may adversely affect our net interest income and profitability.\nDuring the past several years it has been the policy of the Federal Reserve Board to maintain interest rates at historically low levels. As a result, market rates on the loans we have originated and the yields on securities we have purchased have been at these lower levels. As a general matter, our interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets. While we have experienced a recent rising short term interest rate environment, our ability to lower our interest expense will be limited at these interest rate levels while the average yield on our interest-earning assets may continue to decrease. Accordingly, our net interest income may be adversely affected and may decrease, which may have an adverse effect on our future profitability.\nWe may not be able to continue to grow our business, which may adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur total assets have grown from approximately $15.62 billion at December 31, 2013 to $25.13 billion at December 31, 2017. Our business strategy calls for continued growth. Our ability to continue to grow depends, in part, upon our ability to successfully attract deposits, identify favorable loan and investment opportunities, acquire other banks and non-bank entities and enhance our market presence. In the event that we do not continue to grow, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nOur ability to grow successfully will depend on whether we can continue to fund this growth while maintaining cost controls and asset quality, remain in good standing with our regulators, as well as on factors beyond our control, such as national and regional economic conditions and interest rate trends. If we are not able to control costs and maintain asset quality, such growth could adversely impact our earnings and financial condition.\nPublic funds deposits are an important source of funds for us and a reduced level of those deposits may hurt our profits.\nPublic funds deposits are a significant source of funds for our lending and investment activities. At December 31, 2017, $4.70 billion, or 27.1% of our total deposits, consisted of public funds deposits from local government entities, primarily domiciled in the state of New Jersey, such as townships, school districts, hospital districts, sheriff departments and other municipalities, which are collateralized by letters of credit from the FHLB and investment securities. Given our use of these high-average balance public funds deposits as a source of funds, our inability to retain such funds could adversely affect our liquidity. Further, our public funds deposits are primarily interest-bearing demand deposit accounts or short-term time deposits and are therefore more sensitive to interest rate risks. If we are forced to pay higher rates on our public funds accounts to retain those funds, or if we are unable to retain such funds and we are forced to resort to other sources of funds for our lending and investment activities, such as borrowings from the FHLB, the interest expense associated with these other funding sources may be higher than the rates we are currently paying on our public funds deposits, which would adversely affect our net income.\nPublic funds deposits are an important source of funds for us and legislation concerning a State-chartered bank in New Jersey could challenge our overall strategies and potentially reduce the level of public fund deposits.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had $4.70 billion in municipal deposits from various municipalities and other governmental entities. Such deposits are generally used to fund our loans and investments. The State of New Jersey is considering creating a\nState Bank, whose purpose would be to promote economic development, commerce, and industry in the State. It intends to permit State funds, including funds from State institutions and any State public source, to be held by the State Bank. Given the degree of our funding reliance on New Jersey-based municipal deposits and the potential lending ability of the proposed State Bank, we are uncertain of the impact this proposal may have on us. The possible loss of public funds on deposit may increase the costs of our funding needs, which could have a negative impact on our net income and negatively impact liquidity. The proposed legislation was only recently introduced, and there is no assurance it will become law, or will become law in its current form.\nWe could be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers due to breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or certain borrower defaults, which could have an adverse impact on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe sell into the secondary market a portion of the residential mortgage loans that we originate through our mortgage subsidiary, Investors Home Mortgage. The whole loan sale agreements we enter into in connection with such loan sales require us to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans in the event there is a breach of any of representations or warranties. In addition, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan. We have established a reserve for estimated repurchase and indemnification obligations on the residential mortgage loans that we sell. We make various assumptions and judgments in determining this reserve. If our assumptions are incorrect, our reserve may not be sufficient to cover losses from repurchase and indemnification obligations related to our residential loans sold. Such event would have an adverse effect on our earnings.\nFHLB funds are an important source of funding for the Company and a reduced level may have an adverse impact on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe borrow directly from the FHLB and various financial institutions. Our financial flexibility will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates. If we are unable to secure alternative funding or need to rely on more expensive funding sources, our operating margins, profitability and liquidity would be negatively impacted.\nWe may incur impairments to goodwill.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had approximately $77.6 million recorded as goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment, at least annually. Significant negative industry or economic trends, including declines in the market price of our common stock, reduced estimates of future cash flows or disruptions to our business, could result in impairments to goodwill. We operate in competitive environments and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results. If our analysis results in impairment to goodwill, we would be required to record an impairment charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which such impairment is determined to exist. Any such change could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nInvestors Bank Entered Into an Informal Agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance.\nOn August 12, 2016, Investors Bank agreed to enter into an informal agreement (\u201cInformal Agreement\u201d) with the FDIC and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (\u201cNJDOBI\u201d) with regard to Bank Secrecy Act (\u201cBSA\u201d) and Anti-Money Laundering (\u201cAML\u201d) compliance matters. Investors Bank agreed to; 1) develop, adopt and implement a system of internal controls designed to ensure full compliance with BSA; 2) conduct a comprehensive validation of Investors Bank\u2019s BSA/AML automated compliance system; and 3) develop, adopt and implement effective training programs relating to BSA. Investors Bank also agreed to review certain transactions and accounts for BSA and AML compliance and to establish a BSA/AML Compliance Committee of the Board. Numerous actions have been taken or commenced by Investors Bank to strengthen its BSA and AML compliance practices, policies, procedures and controls. These remediation actions are ongoing. Investors Bank has enhanced its risk management and compliance programs through restructured reporting lines, improved technology and increased staff, including hiring senior personnel. The failure to achieve compliance with the requirements of the Informal Agreement could lead to further action by the FDIC and NJDOBI, which could include fines and penalties that would adversely affect Investors Bank. The ultimate costs to remediate are unknown and could adversely affect our growth prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nA worsening of economic conditions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough the U.S. economy has emerged from the severe recession that occurred in 2008 and 2009, economic growth has been slow relative to prior post-recession periods despite the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s unprecedented efforts to maintain low market interest rates and encourage economic growth. A return to prolonged deteriorating economic conditions could significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, and our on-going operations, costs and profitability. Declines in real estate values and sales volumes and unemployment levels may result in greater loan delinquencies,\nincreases in our nonperforming, criticized and classified assets and a decline in demand for our products and services. These events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inability to achieve profitability on new branches may negatively affect our earnings.\nWe have expanded our presence throughout our market area and may pursue further expansion through de novo branching or the purchase of branches from other financial institutions. The profitability of our expansion strategy will depend on whether the income that we generate from the new branches will offset the increased expenses resulting from operating these branches. We expect that it may take a period of time before these branches can become profitable, especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence. During this period, the expense of operating these branches may negatively affect our net income.\nGrowing by acquisition entails integration and certain other risks.\nAlthough we have successfully integrated business acquisitions in recent years, failure to successfully integrate systems subsequent to the completion of any future acquisitions could have a material impact on the operations of Investors Bank.\nFuture acquisition activity could dilute book value.\nBoth nationally and in our region, the banking industry is undergoing consolidation marked by numerous mergers and acquisitions. From time to time we may be presented with opportunities to acquire institutions and/or bank branches and we may engage in discussions and negotiations. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and trading values, and therefore, may result in the dilution of our book value per share.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations have increased our costs of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and the intensity of supervision relating to the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act required various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new rules and regulations, most of which are now in place. The CFPB is under new leadership but it is too early to assess whether this will result in any major change to the supervision or enforcement focus of the CFPB. The Company expects that its business will remain subject to extensive regulations and supervision by the CFPB as well as applicable state consumer protection laws and regulations, which will continue to increase our operating and compliance costs.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets, such as Investors Bank. Banks with $10 billion or less in assets will continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws by their primary bank regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act modified the federal preemption rules that have been applicable for national banks and federal savings associations, and gave state attorneys general the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act required minimum leverage (Tier 1) and risk-based capital requirements for bank and savings and loan holding companies that are no less than those applicable to banks, which excludes (subject to certain grandfathering rules) certain instruments that previously have been eligible for inclusion by bank holding companies as Tier 1 capital, such as trust preferred securities.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also broadened the base for FDIC deposit insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution, rather than deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2009. The legislation also increased the required minimum reserve ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15% to 1.35% of insured deposits, and directed the FDIC to offset the effects of increased assessments on depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act required publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called \u201cgolden parachute\u201d payments. It also provided that the listing standards of the national securities exchanges shall require listed companies to implement and disclose \u201cclawback\u201d policies mandating the recovery of incentive compensation paid to executive officers in connection with accounting restatements. The legislation also directed the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives.\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, federal banking and securities regulators issued final rules to implement the Volcker Rule. Generally, the Volcker Rule restricts insured depository institutions and their affiliated companies from engaging in short-term proprietary trading of certain securities, investing in funds with collateral comprised of less than 100% loans that are not\nregistered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and from engaging in hedging activities that do not hedge a specific identified risk. The Volcker Rule prohibitions and restrictions apply to banking entities of any size, including Investors Bancorp, unless an exception applies.\nWe are subject to more stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity, or constrain us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares.\nIn 2015, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board instituted a new rule which substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to Investors Bank and Investors Bancorp. This rule implemented the \u201cBasel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe rule included new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, and refines the definition of what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 to risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4% under prior rules); (iii) a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The rule also established a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital, and resulted in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 10.5%. The required minimum capital conservation buffer was phased in incrementally and increased to 1.25% on January 1, 2017 and further increased to 1.875% on January 1, 2018. The Conservation Buffer will increase to 2.5% on January 1, 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements for Investors Bank and Investors Bancorp could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions constraining us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements.\nCertain CFPB regulations may continue to restrict our ability to originate and sell mortgage loans.\nThe CFPB issued a rule which requires lenders to make a reasonable, good faith determination of a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a mortgage loan. Loans that meet this \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d definition will be presumed to have complied with the new ability-to-repay standard. Under the CFPB\u2019s rule, a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d loan must not contain certain specified features, including:\n\u2022\nexcessive upfront points and fees (those exceeding 3% of the total loan amount, less \u201cbona fide discount points\u201d for prime loans);\n\u2022interest-only payments;\n\u2022negative-amortization; and\n\u2022terms longer than 30 years.\nAlso, to qualify as a \u201cqualified mortgage,\u201d a borrower\u2019s total debt-to-income ratio may not exceed 43%. Lenders must also verify and document the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify the borrower for the loan and underwrite the loan based on a fully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years, taking into account all applicable taxes, insurance and assessments. The CFPB\u2019s rule on qualified mortgages could continue to limit our ability or desire to make certain types of loans or loans to certain borrowers, or could make it more expensive and/or time consuming to make these loans, which could limit our growth or profitability.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in U.S. tax laws and regulations.\nThe Tax Act, the full impact of which is subject to further evaluation and analysis, is likely to have both positive and negative effects on our financial performance. The new legislation will result in a reduction in our federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018, which will have a favorable impact on our earnings and capital generation abilities. However, the new legislation also enacted limitations on certain deductions, such as the deduction of FDIC deposit insurance premiums and executive compensation, which will partially offset the anticipated increase in net earnings from the lower tax rate. In addition, under ASC 740, Income Taxes, companies are required to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period of enactment. As a result of the lower corporate tax rate, the resulting impact of the re-measurement of the Company\u2019s deferred tax balances was $49.2 million, which was recorded as a tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017. The impact of the Tax Act may differ from the foregoing, possibly materially, due to changes in interpretations or in assumptions that we have made, guidance or regulations that may be promulgated, and other actions that we may take as a result of the Tax Act. Similarly, the Bank\u2019s customers are likely to experience varying effects from both the individual and business tax provisions of the Tax Act and such effects, whether positive or negative, may have a corresponding impact on our business and the economy as a whole. We are subject to changes in tax law\nthat could increase our effective tax rates. These law changes may be retroactive to previous periods and as a result could negatively affect our current and future financial performance.\nWe currently utilize incentive-based payment arrangements with our employees as compensation practices. Potential regulatory changes to this practice could have an impact on our current practices and impact our results of operations.\nInvestors Bank is subject to the compensation-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act which prohibit incentive-based payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking. The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators\u2019 policies on incentive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the future.\nStrong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services and non bank industry is intense. In our market area, we compete with numerous commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. In addition, we compete with numerous online financial service providers who compete in the new digital fintech marketplace and who may not be subject to our regulatory requirements. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have, have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business, and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, larger bank and non bank competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we can. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. The greater resources and deposit and loan products offered by some of our competitors may limit our ability to increase our interest-earning assets. For additional information see \u201cItem 1. Business.\u201d\nAny future increase in FDIC insurance premiums will adversely impact our earnings.\nAs a \u201clarge institution\u201d within the meaning of FDIC regulations (i.e., greater than $10 billion in assets), Investors Bank\u2019s deposit insurance premium is determined differently than smaller banks. Small banks are assessed based on a risk classification determined by examination ratings, financial ratios and certain specified adjustments. Large institutions are subject to assessment based upon a more detailed scorecard approach involving (i) a performance score determined using forward-looking risk measures, including certain stress testing, and (ii) a loss severity score, which is designed to measure, based on modeling, potential loss to the FDIC insurance fund if the institution failed. The total score is converted to an assessment rate, subject to certain adjustments, with institutions deemed riskier paying higher assessments.\nWe may eliminate dividends on our common stock.\nAlthough we pay quarterly cash dividends to our stockholders, stockholders are not entitled to receive dividends. Downturns in domestic and global economies and other factors could cause our board of directors to consider, among other things, the elimination of or reduction in the amount and/or frequency of cash dividends paid on our common stock.\nWe could be adversely affected by failure in our internal controls.\nWe continue to devote a significant amount of effort, time and resources to continually strengthen our controls and ensure compliance with complex accounting standards and banking regulations. A failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings, but also on the perception that customers, regulators and investors may have of us.\nFailures or material breaches in security of the Company\u2019s systems and telecommunications networks, or those of a third-party service provider, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and earnings.\nInvestors Bank collects, processes and stores sensitive consumer data by utilizing computer systems and telecommunications networks operated by both the Bank and third-party service providers. Our necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions poses the risk that technical system flaws, employee errors, tampering or manipulation of those systems, or attacks by third parties will result in losses and may be difficult to detect. The Bank has security and backup recovery systems in place, as well as a business continuity plan, designed to ensure the computer systems will not be inoperable, to the extent possible. Our inability to use or access those information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timeliness and efficiency of the Bank\u2019s business operations. Risks to our systems result from a variety of factors, including the potential for bad acts on the part of hackers, criminals, employees or others. As one example, in recent years, some banks have experience denial of service attacks in which individuals or organizations flood the bank\u2019s website with extraordinarily high volumes of traffic, with the goal and effect of disrupting the ability of the bank to process transactions. Other businesses have been victims of ransomware attacks in which the business becomes unable to access its own information and is presented with a demand to pay a ransom in order to once again have access to its information. The Bank is also at risk from the impact of natural disasters, terrorism and international hostilities on its systems or from the effects of outages or other failures involving power or\ncommunications systems operated by others. These risks also arise from the same types of threats to businesses with which the Bank conducts business.\nThe Bank could be adversely affected if one of its employees causes a significant operational break-down or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our operations or systems. The Bank is further exposed to the risk that its third-party service providers may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risks as the Bank). These disruptions may interfere with service to our customers, cause additional regulatory scrutiny and result in a financial loss or liability.\nMisconduct by employees could include fraudulent, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of clients or improper use of confidential information. The Bank may not be able to prevent employee errors or misconduct, and the precautions the Bank takes to detect this type of activity might not be effective in all cases. Employee errors or misconduct could subject the Bank to civil claims for negligence or regulatory enforcement actions, including fines and restrictions on our business.\nIn addition, there have been instances where financial institutions have been victims of fraudulent activity in which criminals pose as customers to initiate wire and automated clearinghouse transactions out of customer accounts. The recent massive breach of the systems of a credit bureau presents additional threats as criminals now have more information about a larger portion of the population of the United States than past breaches have involved, which could be used by criminals to pose as customers initiating transfers of money from customer accounts. Although the Bank has policies and procedures in place to verify the authenticity of its customers, the Bank cannot assure that such policies and procedures will prevent all fraudulent transfers. Such activity can result in financial liability and harm to our reputation.\nThe Bank has implemented security controls to prevent unauthorized access to its computer systems and requires its third-party service providers to maintain similar controls. However, we cannot be certain that these measures will be successful. A security breach of our computer systems and loss of confidential information, such as customer account numbers and related information, could result in a loss of customers\u2019 confidence and, thus, loss of business. The Bank could also lose revenue if competitors gain access to confidential information about our business operations and use it to compete with the Bank. In addition, unauthorized access to or use of sensitive data could subject the Bank to litigation and liability, and costs to prevent further such occurrences.\nFurther, the Bank may be affected by data breaches at retailers and other third parties who participate in data interchanges with the Bank and its customers that involve the theft of customer debit card data, which may include the theft of the Bank debit card PIN numbers and card information used to make purchases at such retailers and other third parties. Such data breaches could result in the Bank incurring significant expenses to reissue debit cards and cover losses, which could result in a material adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s results of operations. To date, the Bank has not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, but there can be no assurance that the Bank will not suffer such attacks or attempted breaches, or incur resulting losses, in the future. The Bank\u2019s risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats. The Bank plans to continue to implement internet and mobile banking capabilities to meet customer demand and the current economic environment. As cyber and other data security threats continue to evolve, the Bank may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify and enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities.\nThe Bank\u2019s assets at risk for cyber-attacks include financial assets and non-public information belonging to customers. Investors Bank uses several third-party vendors who have access to Investors Bank\u2019s assets via electronic media. Certain cyber security risks arise due to this access, including cyber espionage, blackmail, ransom and theft.\nAll of the types of cyber incidents discusses above could result in damage to the Bank\u2019s reputation, loss of customer business, costs of incentives to customers or business partners in order to maintain their relationships, litigation, increased regulatory scrutiny and potential enforcement actions, repairs of system damage, increased investments in cybersecurity (such as obtaining additional technology, making organizational changes, deploying additional personnel, training personnel and engaging consultants), increased insurance premiums, and loss of investor confidence, all of which could result in financial loss and material adverse effects on the Bank\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and earnings.\nOur failure to effectively deploy the capital raised in our second step conversion offering may have an adverse effect on our financial performance.\nWe invested 50% of the net proceeds from our second step conversion offering in Investors Bank; provided funding to our Employee Stock Ownership Plan for the purchase of 6,617,421 shares of common stock sold in the offering; and contributed $20.0 million to Investors Charitable foundation by issuing 1,000,000 shares and a $10.0 million cash contribution. A substantial portion of the net proceeds were used to pay off short-term borrowings as they matured and invest in securities. We continue to utilize the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including, among other items, paying cash dividends and repurchasing shares of our common stock. Our failure to deploy the capital effectively may reduce our profitability and may adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nOur recruitment efforts may not be sufficient to implement our business strategy and execute successful operations.\nAs we continue to grow, we may find our recruitment efforts more challenging. If we do not succeed in attracting, hiring, and integrating experienced or qualified personnel, we may not be able to continue to successfully implement our business strategy.\nWe continue to expand our business lending efforts, which may expose us to increased lending risks and may have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nIn an effort to diversify our loan portfolio, we have expanded our lending team to include leveraged lending teams as well as a healthcare lending team. We will continue to explore other markets within business lending. These types of loans generally have a higher risk of loss compared to our one- to four-family residential real estate loans and multi-family loans, which could have a negative effect on our results of operations. In addition, because we are not as experienced with these new loan products, we may require additional time and resources for offering and managing such products effectively or may be unsuccessful in offering such products at a profit.\nSevere weather, acts of terrorism and other external events could impact our ability to conduct business.\nWeather-related events have adversely impacted our market area in recent years, especially areas located near coastal waters and flood prone areas. Such events that may cause significant flooding and other storm-related damage may become more common events in the future. Financial institutions have been, and continue to be, targets of terrorist threats aimed at compromising operating and communication systems and the metropolitan New York area and Northern New Jersey remain central targets for potential acts of terrorism. Such events could cause significant damage, impact the stability of our facilities and result in additional expenses, impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, reduce the value of collateral securing repayment of our loans, and result in the loss of revenue. While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 90952, "SIC": 6036, "TIC": "ISBC"}
