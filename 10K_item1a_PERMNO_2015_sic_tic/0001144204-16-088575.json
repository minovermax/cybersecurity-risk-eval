{"cik": "1083220", "company": "XCel Brands, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information contained herein or incorporated herein by reference, the risks and uncertainties and other factors described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and share price and could also cause our future business, financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from the results contemplated by any forward-looking statement we may make herein, in any other document we file with the SEC, or in any press release or other written or oral statement we may make. Please also see \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d on page 3 for additional information regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a limited amount of cash to grow our operations. If we cannot obtain additional sources of cash, our growth prospects and future profitability may be materially adversely affected, and we may not be able to implement our business plan. Such additional financing may not be available on satisfactory terms or it may not be available when needed, or at all.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $16.9 million. Although we believe that our existing cash and our anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to sustain our operations at our current expense levels for at least 12 months subsequent to December 31, 2015, we may require significant additional cash to expand our operations or acquire additional brands. Our inability to finance our growth, either internally through our operations or externally, may limit our growth potential and our ability to execute our business strategy successfully. If we issue securities to raise capital to finance operations and/or pay down or restructure our debt, our existing stockholders may experience dilution. In addition, the new securities may have rights senior to those of our common stock.\nWe have a limited relevant operating history as we have only operated the Mizrahi brands since September 2011 and have acquired our other brands over the past two years.\nWe acquired the Ripka assets and began licensing the Ripka brands in April 2014, acquired the H Halston brands in December 2014, and the C Wonder brands in July 2015. We only recently began to generate product sales through QVC under the H Halston brands in September 2015 and the C Wonder brands in March 2016. Since we only recently acquired the Ripka brands, H Halston brands and C Wonder brands, we have limited experience operating and managing these brands. Integrating the Ripka brands, H Halston brands and C Wonder brands and/or any future brands that we may acquire into our existing operations and operating and managing the Ripka brands, H Halston brands and C Wonder brands and/or any future brands that we may acquire will require the expenditure of a significant amount of our time and resources and could negatively impact our results of operations. Acquisitions of additional brands may also involve challenges related to merging diverse cultures and retaining key employees. Any failure to integrate additional brands successfully in the future may adversely impact our reputation and business.\nAlthough the Mizrahi brand name has been an established brand for over 25 years, the license agreement related to the Isaac Mizrahi trademarks with QVC, which we refer to as the IM QVC Agreement, has been operating only since December 2009. Prior to our acquisition of the Mizrahi business in September 2011, it was run by Isaac Mizrahi, who became our Chief Designer, and Marisa Gardini, who became a director of the Company (and served in such capacity until June 2, 2015). Certain other members of our management performed consulting services for IM Ready-Made, LLC, or IM Ready, but were not responsible for its operations. Since we acquired the Mizrahi business, we have substantially expanded our business through operations in areas in which we had not previously engaged. We have entered into additional licenses for the Mizrahi brands, for which many of our licensees have a limited history of designing, manufacturing and selling our Mizrahi brands.\nOur significant debt obligations could impair our liquidity and financial condition, and in the event we are unable to meet our debt obligations, we could lose ownership of our trademarks and/or other assets.\nOn February 26, 2016, we entered into a new senior secured credit facility with Bank Hapoalim B.M., pursuant to which we entered into a $27.875 million term loan. In addition, previously we issued to IM Ready a promissory note in connection with our acquisition of the Mizrahi business, which we refer to as the IM Seller Note, which had an outstanding balance of $5.1 million (carrying value of $4.9 million, discounted for imputed interest) as of December 31, 2015. Of the remaining outstanding balance of the IM Seller Note, $0.75 million was paid in January 2016 in cash, and $4.38 million is payable in cash or our common stock, at our sole discretion. In addition, we issued to Ripka non-interest bearing promissory notes in connection with our acquisition of the Ripka brands, which we refer to as the Ripka Seller Notes, of which $0.5 million of the principal amount remained outstanding as of December 31, 2015. We also have contingent obligations associated with the acquisitions of the Mizrahi business, the Ripka brands, and the C Wonder brand, for which we have recorded $6.9 million as contingent obligations on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. Of this amount, $0.25 million was paid in cash in February 2016 and $6.6 million may be payable in cash or common stock at our sole discretion, subject to the consent of our senior lender to pay in cash. We may also assume or incur additional debt, including secured debt, in the future in connection with, or to fund, future acquisitions or for other operating needs.\nOur debt obligations:\n\u2022 could impair our liquidity;\n\u2022 could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our other obligations;\n\u2022 are secured by substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our debt obligations, which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate requirements;\n\u2022 could impede us from obtaining additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate purposes;\n\u2022 impose restrictions on us with respect to the use of our available cash, including in connection with future transactions;\n\u2022 could limit our ability to execute on our acquisition strategy;\n\u2022 make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business prospects and could limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our licensing markets; and\n\u2022 could place us at a competitive disadvantage when compared to our competitors who have less debt.\nIn the event that we fail in the future to make any required payment under the agreements governing our indebtedness or if we fail to comply with the financial and operating covenants contained in those agreements, we would be in default with respect to that indebtedness and the lenders could declare such indebtedness to be immediately due and payable. Termination of any of the QVC Agreements - including the IM QVC Agreement, the Ripka QVC Agreement, the H QVC Agreement, and the C Wonder QVC Agreement - would also result in a default under our credit facility with Bank Hapoalim B.M. A debt default could significantly diminish the market value and marketability of our common stock and could result in the acceleration of the payment obligations under all or a portion of our indebtedness, or a renegotiation of our credit facility with Bank Hapoalim B.M. with more onerous terms and/or additional equity dilution. Since substantially all of our debt obligations are secured by our assets, upon a default, our lenders may be able to foreclose on our assets.\nA substantial portion of our licensing revenue is concentrated with a limited number of licensees such that the loss of any of such licensees could decrease our revenue and impair our cash flows.\nA substantial portion of our revenues has been paid by QVC, through the QVC Agreements and a lesser extent for the LCNY brands through the design agreement with QVC related to the design and promotion of the LCNY brand exclusively for QVC, which shall expire on July 31, 2016. Based on the Ripka QVC Agreement, which was effective as of April 3, 2014, the H QVC Agreement, which was effective on December 22, 2014, and the C Wonder QVC Agreement, which was effective July 31, 2015, an additional portion of our revenues are derived from QVC. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, QVC accounted for 80%, and 79%, respectively, of our revenues. Because we are dependent on these agreements with QVC for a significant portion of our revenues, if QVC were to have financial difficulties, or if QVC decides not to renew or extend its existing agreements with us, our revenue and cash flows could be reduced substantially. Our cash flow would also be significantly impacted if there were significant delays in our collection of receivables from QVC. Additionally, we have limited control over the programming that QVC devotes to our brands or its promotional sales with our brands (such as Today\u2019s Special Value sales). If QVC reduces or modifies its programming or promotional sales related to our brands, our revenues and cash flows could be reduced substantially.\nThe current term of the IM QVC Agreement, which was renewed on July 2, 2013, expires on September 30, 2020, with automatic one-year renewal periods thereafter unless terminated by either party. The LCNY Agreement and the Design Agreement expire on July 31, 2016. The current term of the Ripka QVC Agreement expires on March 31, 2019, with automatic one-year renewal periods hereinafter unless terminated by either party. The current term of the H QVC Agreement expires on December 31, 2019, with automatic three-year renewal periods thereafter unless terminated by either party. The current term of the C Wonder QVC Agreement expires on January 1, 2021, with automatic three-year renewal periods thereafter unless terminated by either party. There can be no assurance that the agreements will be renewed upon expiration of the current terms, or that QVC will not terminate our licensing agreements, or that we will be able to replace revenues and cash flows from the Design Agreement and the LCNY Agreement.\nWhile our business with QVC has grown since the IsaacMizrahiLIVE brand was launched in 2009, there is no guarantee that it will continue to grow in the future. We also have a limited operating history with our Ripka, H Halston, and C Wonder brands. Additionally, there can be no assurance that our other licensees will be able to generate sales of products under our brands or grow their existing sales of products under our brands, and if they do generate sales, there is no guarantee that they will not cause a decline in sales of products being sold through QVC.\nOur agreements with QVC restrict us from selling products under our brands with certain retailers, or branded products we sell on QVC to any other retailer except certain direct-response television channels in other territories approved by QVC, and provides QVC with a right to terminate the respective agreement if we breach these provisions.\nAlthough most of our licenses and our QVC Agreements prohibit the sale of products under our brands to retailers who are restricted by QVC, and our license agreements with other direct response television companies prohibit such licensees from selling products to retailers restricted by QVC under the brands we sell on QVC outside of certain approved territories, one or more of our licensees could sell to a restricted retailer or territory, putting us in breach of our agreements with QVC and exposing us to potential termination by QVC. A breach of any of these agreements could also result in QVC seeking monetary damages, seeking an injunction against us and our other licensees and/or terminating the respective agreement, which could have a material adverse effect on our net income and cash flows. Termination of any one of our agreements with QVC would result in a default under our credit facility with Bank Hapoalim B.M. and would also enable Bank Hapoalim B.M. to foreclose on our assets, including our membership interests in our subsidiaries, which combined currently hold all of our trademarks and other intangible assets.\nWe are dependent upon the promotional services of Isaac Mizrahi as they relate to the Mizrahi brands.\nIf we lose the services of Isaac Mizrahi, we may not be able to fully comply with the terms of our license agreements with QVC and The Shopping Channel or our design agreements with KSC and QVC, and it may result in significant reductions in the value of the Mizrahi brands and our prospects, revenues and cash flows. Isaac Mizrahi is a key individual in our continued promotion of the Mizrahi brands and the principal salesperson of the Mizrahi brands on QVC and The Shopping Channel. Failure of Isaac Mizrahi to provide services to QVC could result in a termination of the IM QVC Agreement, which could trigger an event of default under our credit facility with Bank Hapoalim B.M. Although we have entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Mizrahi and he is a significant stockholder of Xcel, there is no guarantee that we will not lose his services. To the extent that any of Mr. Mizrahi\u2019s services become unavailable to us, we will likely need to find a replacement for Mr. Mizrahi to promote the Mizrahi brands. Competition for skilled designers and high-profile brand promoters is intense, and compensation levels may be high, and there is no guarantee that we would be able to identify and attract a qualified replacement, or if Mr. Mizrahi\u2019s services are not available to us, that we would be able to promote the Mizrahi brands as well as we are able to with Mr. Mizrahi. This could significantly affect the value of the Mizrahi brands and our ability to market the brands, and could impede our ability to fully implement our business plan and future growth strategy, which would harm our business and prospects. Additionally, while we acquired all trademarks, image, and likeness of Isaac Mizrahi, pursuant to the acquisition of the Mizrahi business and his employment agreement, Mr. Mizrahi has retained certain rights to participate in outside business activities, including hosting and appearing in television shows, movies and theater productions, and writing and publishing books and other publications. Mr. Mizrahi\u2019s participation in these personal business ventures could limit his availability to us and affect his ability to perform under this employment agreement. Finally, there is no guarantee that Mr. Mizrahi will not take an action that consumers view as negative, which may harm the Mizrahi brands as well as our business and prospects.\nWe are dependent upon the promotional services of our other spokespersons for our other brands.\nIf we lose the services of a spokesperson, we may not be able to fully comply with the terms of our license agreements with QVC and The Shopping Channel, and it may result in significant reductions in the value of the brands and our prospects, revenues, and cash flows. Judith Ripka is the principal spokesperson of the Ripka brands on QVC and The Shopping Channel. Cameron Silver is the principal salesperson of the H Halston brands on QVC, and Brad Goreski is the principal spokesperson of the C Wonder brands on QVC. The failure of a spokesperson to provide spokesperson services to QVC or a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant by Ms. Ripka under the Ripka QVC Agreement or by Mr. Silver or Mr. Goreski under their respective spokesperson agreements with QVC, combined with our failure to find an alternate host acceptable to QVC, could result in a termination of the respective QVC Agreement(s) which could trigger an event of default under our credit facility with Bank Hapoalim B.M. Although we have entered into employment agreements with each of these individuals and Ms. Ripka is a stockholder of Xcel, there is no guarantee that we will not lose their services. To the extent that any of their services as a spokesperson become unavailable to us, we will likely need to find a replacement to promote our brands. Competition for skilled brand promoters is intense, and required compensation levels may be high, and there is no guarantee that we would be able to identify and attract a qualified replacement, or that we would be able to promote our brands as well as we are able to with our current spokespersons. This could significantly affect the value of our brands and our ability to market the brands, and could impede our ability to fully implement our business plan and future growth strategy, which would harm our business and prospects. Each spokesperson has retained certain rights to participate in outside business activities. Each of these individuals\u2019 participation in these personal business ventures could limit their availability to us and affect their ability to perform as a spokesperson in accordance with their respective employment agreements. Finally, there is no guarantee that one of these individuals will not take an action that the consumer views as negative, which may harm our brands as well as our business and prospects.\nWe are subject to certain restrictions under our agreement with The H Company IP, LLC, and do not have ownership over the H by Halston and H Halston trademarks for certain categories and territories.\nThe asset purchase agreement with The H Company IP, LLC, or HIP, pursuant to which we acquired our rights to the H by Halston and H Halston trademarks, contains certain limitations and restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to take the H Halston brands to a mass retailer (including Wal-Mart Stores, K-Mart, Sears, JC Penney\u2019s, and Kohl\u2019s), excludes the rights to fragrance categories under the H Halston brands, and restricts our ability to sign licenses or sell products in China. Although our business strategy for the H Halston brands does not include such prohibited actions, in the event that the H QVC License Agreement were terminated or other factors affected our ability to execute on our existing strategy, these limitations may restrict us from certain alternate strategies that we may otherwise pursue.\nOur H Halston brands may be affected by the related Halston brands and businesses.\nWe acquired the H Halston brands from HIP, which retained rights to the Halston Heritage, Halston, and certain other related brands. In addition, Elizabeth Arden owns certain rights in the H Halston brands related to fragrance categories. We believe that the businesses under these related brands currently add value to the H Halston brands, including creating customer awareness for the \u201cHalston\u201d name through marketing and premium product lines. Additionally, the asset purchase agreement and license agreement with HIP contain restrictions intended to prevent HIP or its successors from making changes to the business strategy under such related brands that could adversely affect our H Halston brands. However, a failure of the owners of the related Halston brands to properly operate their business, a re-positioning of the related Halston brands, or an action that breaches our agreements with HIP may have an adverse impact on our businesses under the H Halston brands.\nThe failure of our licensees to adequately produce, market and sell quality products bearing our brand names in their license categories or to pay their obligations under their license agreements could result in a decline in our results of operations and impact our ability to service our debt obligations.\nOur revenues are dependent on payments made to us under our licensing agreements. Although the licensing agreements for our brands typically require the advance payment to us of a portion of the licensing fees and in many cases provide for guaranteed minimum royalty payments to us, the failure of our licensees to satisfy their obligations under these agreements or their inability to operate successfully or at all, could result in their breach and/or the early termination of such agreements, the non-renewal of such agreements or our decision to amend such agreements to reduce the guaranteed minimums or sales royalties due thereunder, thereby eliminating some or all of that stream of revenue. Moreover, during the terms of the license agreements, we are substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of our licensees to maintain the quality and marketability of the products bearing our trademarks, as their failure to do so could materially tarnish our brands, thereby harming our future growth and prospects. In addition, the failure of our licensees to meet their production, manufacturing and distribution requirements or actively market the branded licensed products could cause a decline in their sales and potentially decrease the amount of royalty payments (over and above the guaranteed minimums) due to us. A weak economy or softness in the apparel and retail sectors could exacerbate this risk. This, in turn, could decrease our potential revenues. These risks are further increased with respect to our exclusive sublicense of the H Halston trademark to HIP, as we will be dependent upon the efforts and abilities of a sole licensor. The concurrent failure by several of our material licensees to meet their financial obligations to us could jeopardize our ability to meet the debt service coverage ratios required in connection with our debt facility or facilities. Further, such failure may impact our ability to make required payments with respect to such indebtedness. The failure to meet such debt service coverage ratios or to make such required payments would give our lenders the right to accelerate all obligations under our debt facility or facilities and foreclose on our trademarks, license agreements and other related assets securing such notes.\nOur business is dependent on continued market acceptance of our brands and any future brands we acquire and the products of our licensees.\nAlthough many of our licensees guarantee minimum net sales and minimum royalties to us, many of our licensees are not yet selling licensed products or currently have limited distribution of licensed products, and a failure of our brands or of products bearing our brands to achieve or maintain broad market acceptance could cause a reduction of our licensing revenues and could further cause existing licensees not to renew their agreements. Such failure could also cause the devaluation of our trademarks, which are our primary assets, making it more difficult for us to renew our current licenses upon their expiration or enter into new or additional licenses for our trademarks. In addition, if such devaluation of our trademarks were to occur, a material impairment in the carrying value of one or more of our trademarks could also occur and be charged as an expense to our operating results. Continued market acceptance of the Mizrahi brands, the Ripka brands and H Halston brands and our licensees\u2019 products, as well as market acceptance of the C Wonder brands upon introduction and any future products bearing any future brands we may acquire, is subject to a high degree of uncertainty and constantly changing consumer tastes and preferences. Creating and maintaining market acceptance of our licensees\u2019 products and creating market acceptance of new products and categories of products bearing our marks may require substantial marketing efforts, which may, from time to time, also include our expenditure of significant additional funds to keep pace with changing consumer demands, which funds may or may not be available on a timely basis, on acceptable terms or at all. Additional marketing efforts and expenditures may not, however, result in either increased market acceptance of, or additional licenses for, our trademarks or increased market acceptance, or sales, of our licensees\u2019 products. Furthermore, we do not actually design or manufacture all of the products bearing our marks, and therefore, have less control over such products\u2019 quality and design than a traditional product manufacturer might have. The failure of our licensees to maintain the quality of their products could harm the reputation and marketability of our brands, which would adversely impact our business.\nWe expect to achieve growth based upon our plans to expand our business under the Mizrahi brands, integrate and expand our business under the Ripka brands, and develop a licensing business under the H Halston and C Wonder brands. If we fail to manage our expected future growth, our business and operating results could be materially harmed.\nWe expect to achieve growth in our existing brands and intend to seek new opportunities and international expansion through direct-response television and licensing arrangements. The success of our company, however, will still remain largely dependent on our ability to build and maintain broad market acceptance of our brands and to contract with and retain key licensees and on our licensees\u2019 ability to accurately predict upcoming fashion and design trends within their respective customer bases and fulfill the product requirements of their particular retail channels within the global marketplace.\nOur recent growth has placed, and our anticipated future growth will continue to place, considerable demands on our management and other resources. Our ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth, if any, will depend on the sufficiency and adequacy of our current resources and infrastructure and our ability to continue to identify, attract and retain personnel to manage our brands and integrate any brands we may acquire, including the recently acquired C Wonder brands, into our operations. There can be no assurance that our personnel, systems, procedures and controls will be adequate to support our operations and properly oversee our brands. The failure to support our operations effectively and properly oversee our brands could cause harm to our brands and have a material adverse effect on the value of such brands and on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be unable to leverage our core competencies in managing apparel and jewelry brands to managing brands in new product categories.\nAlso, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and sustain meaningful growth. Our growth may be limited by a number of factors including increased competition among branded products at brick-and-mortar, internet and direct-response retailers, decreased airtime on QVC and/or The Shopping Channel, competition for retail license and brand acquisitions and insufficient capitalization for future transactions.\nDuring the latter part of 2015 we revised our bricks and mortar licensing strategy pursuant to which we entered into an extensive licensing agreement with Lord and Taylor to market our Mizrahi, H Halston and C Wonder brands, as well as potential additional proprietary brand(s) developed for this agreement. As a result, we have been redirecting certain licensed categories on an exclusive basis to Lord and Taylor.\nThe L&T License subjects us to many risks. Pursuant to the agreement, we are managing the design and manufacturing oversight of products in an innovative quick time response supply chain for the brands described above. While we believe this is an innovative model designed to manage a retail chain inventory, to our knowledge, this model has not been implemented on a wide-scale basis in the fashion industry. There are numerous risks associated with its implementation, including, our ability to identify, manage and facilitate suppliers who can meet the pricing, quality and time requirements imposed by Lord & Taylor. In the event we breach our agreement or, in certain cases, if Lord & Taylor terminates an agreement with a supplier approved by us as a result of a breach or default by such supplier, Lord & Taylor may terminate our agreement. The success of our bricks and mortar licensing strategy is substantially dependent on the success of our agreement with Lord & Taylor, including the efforts of Lord & Taylor and the suppliers and other third parties introduced to Lord & Taylor. We cannot assure you that the business with Lord & Taylor or that this strategy will be successful. Failure to successfully implement this strategy will result in reduced revenues and cash flows and harm to our reputation.\nIf we are unable to identify and successfully acquire additional trademarks, our growth may be limited and, even if additional trademarks are acquired, we may not realize anticipated benefits due to integration or licensing difficulties.\nWhile we are focused on growing our existing brands, we intend to selectively seek to acquire additional intellectual property. However, as our competitors continue to pursue a brand management model, acquisitions may become more expensive and suitable acquisition candidates could become more difficult to find. In addition, even if we successfully acquire additional intellectual property or the rights to use additional intellectual property, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability levels that justify our investment in, or realize planned benefits with respect to, those additional brands.\nAlthough we will seek to temper our acquisition risks by following acquisition guidelines relating to purchase price and valuation, projected returns, existing strength of the brand, its diversification benefits to us, its potential licensing scale and creditworthiness of licensee base, acquisitions, whether they be of additional intellectual property assets or of the companies that own them, entail numerous risks, any of which could detrimentally affect our reputation, our results of operations and/or the value of our common stock. These risks include, among others:\n\u2022 unanticipated costs associated with the target acquisition or its integration with our company;\n\u2022 our ability to identify or consummate additional quality business opportunities, including potential licenses and new product lines and markets;\n\u2022 negative effects on reported results of operations from acquisition related charges and costs, and amortization of acquired intangibles;\n\u2022 diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022 the challenges of maintaining focus on, and continuing to execute, core strategies and business plans as our brand and license portfolio grows and becomes more diversified;\n\u2022 adverse effects on existing licensing and other relationships;\n\u2022 potential difficulties associated with the retention of key employees, and difficulties, delays and unanticipated costs associated with the assimilation of personnel, operations, systems and cultures, which may be retained by us in connection with or as a result of our acquisitions;\n\u2022 risks of entering new domestic and international markets (whether it be with respect to new licensed product categories or new licensed product distribution channels) or markets in which we have limited prior experience; and\n\u2022 increased concentration in our revenues with one or more customers in the event that the brand has distribution channels in which we currently distribute products under one or more of our brands.\nWhen we acquire intellectual property assets or the companies that own them, our due diligence reviews are subject to inherent uncertainties and may not reveal all potential risks. We may therefore fail to discover or inaccurately assess undisclosed or contingent liabilities, including liabilities for which we may have responsibility as a successor to the seller or the target company. As a successor, we may be responsible for any past or continuing violations of law by the seller or the target company. Although we will generally attempt to seek contractual protections through representations, warranties and indemnities, we cannot be sure that we will obtain such provisions in our acquisitions or that such provisions will fully protect us from all unknown, contingent or other liabilities or costs. Finally, claims against us relating to any acquisition may necessitate our seeking claims against the seller for which the seller may not, or may not be able to, indemnify us or that may exceed the scope, duration or amount of the seller\u2019s indemnification obligations.\nAcquiring additional intellectual property could also have a significant effect on our financial position and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and yearly operating results. Acquisitions could result in the recording of significant goodwill and intangible assets on our financial statements, the amortization or impairment of which would reduce our reported earnings in subsequent years. No assurance can be given with respect to the timing, likelihood or financial or business effect of any possible transaction. Moreover, our ability to grow through the acquisition of additional intellectual property will also depend on the availability of capital to complete the necessary acquisition arrangements. In the event that we are unable to obtain debt financing on acceptable terms for a particular acquisition, we may elect to pursue the acquisition through the issuance by us of shares of our common stock (and, in certain cases, convertible securities) as equity consideration, which could dilute our common stock and reduce our earnings per share, and any such dilution could reduce the market price of our common stock unless and until we were able to achieve revenue growth or cost savings and other business economies sufficient to offset the effect of such an issuance. As a result, there is no guarantee that our stockholders will achieve greater returns as a result of any future acquisitions we complete.\nBecause of the intense competition within our existing and potential wholesale licensees\u2019 markets and the strength of some of their competitors, we and our licensees may not be able to continue to compete successfully.\nWe expect our existing and future licenses to relate to products in the apparel, fashion accessories, jewelry, footwear, beauty and fragrance, home products and d\u00e9cor, pet products, fabrics and yarns and other consumer industries, in which our licensees face intense competition, including from our other brands and licensees. In general, competitive factors include quality, price, style, name recognition and service. In addition, various fads and the limited availability of shelf space could affect competition for our licensees\u2019 products. Many of our licensees\u2019 competitors have greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than our licensees and have achieved significant name recognition for their brand names. Our licensees may be unable to successfully compete in the markets for their products, and we may not be able to continue to compete successfully with respect to our licensing arrangements.\nIf our competition for licenses increases, or any of our current licensees elect not to renew their licenses or renew on terms less favorable than today, our growth plans could be slowed and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nTo the extent the Company seeks to acquire additional brands, we will face competition to retain licenses and to complete such acquisitions. The ownership, licensing, and management of brands is becoming a more widely utilized method of managing consumer brands as production continues to become commoditized and manufacturing capacity increases worldwide. The Company faces competition from numerous direct competitors, both publicly and privately-held, including traditional apparel and consumer brand companies, other brand management companies and private equity groups. Companies that traditionally focused on wholesale manufacturing and sourcing models are now exploring licensing as a way of growing their businesses through strategic licensing partners and direct-to-retail licensing arrangements. Furthermore, our current or potential licensees may decide to develop or purchase brands rather than renew or enter into license agreements with us. In addition, this increased competition could result in lower sales of products offered by our licensees under our brands. If our competition for licenses increases, it may take us longer to procure additional licenses which could slow our growth rate.\nOur licensees are subject to risks and uncertainties of foreign manufacturing and the price, availability and quality of raw materials that could interrupt their operations or increase their operating costs, thereby affecting their ability to deliver goods to the market, reducing or delaying their sales and decreasing our potential royalty revenues.\nSubstantially all of the products sold by our licensees are manufactured overseas. There are substantial risks associated with foreign manufacturing, including changes in laws relating to quotas, and the payment of tariffs and duties, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, shipping delays and international political, regulatory and economic developments. Further, our licensees may experience fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials, including as it relates to jewelry the price, availability and quality of gold, silver, and other precious and semi-precious metals and gemstones, used by them in their manufactured products or purchased finished goods. Any of these risks could increase our licensees\u2019 operating costs. Our licensees also import finished products and assume all risk of loss and damage with respect to these goods once they are shipped by their suppliers. If these goods are destroyed or damaged during shipment, the revenues of our licensees, and thus our royalty revenues over and above the guaranteed minimums, could be reduced as a result of our licensees\u2019 inability to deliver or their delay in delivering their products.\nOur failure to protect our proprietary rights could compromise our competitive position and decrease the value of our brands.\nWe own, through our wholly owned subsidiaries, various U.S. federal trademark registrations and foreign trademark registrations for our brands, together with pending applications for registration, which are vital to the success and further growth of our business and which we believe have significant value. With respect to the H by Halston and H Halston brands, certain U.S. applications for registration that are based upon intent-to-use currently are held in the name of HIP, from whom we purchased the marks, until such time as the marks are put into use and assigned to us. We rely primarily upon a combination of trademarks, copyrights and contractual restrictions to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights domestically and internationally. We believe that such measures afford only limited protection and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that the actions taken by us to establish, protect and enforce our trademarks and other proprietary rights will prevent infringement of our intellectual property rights by others, or prevent the loss of licensing revenue or other damages caused therefrom.\nFor instance, despite our efforts to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our intellectual property, which could harm the reputation of our brands, decrease their value and/or cause a decline in our licensees\u2019 sales and thus our revenues. Further, we and our licensees may not be able to detect infringement of our intellectual property rights quickly or at all, and at times, we or our licensees may not be successful in combating counterfeit, infringing or knockoff products, thereby damaging our competitive position. In addition, we depend upon the laws of the countries where our licensees\u2019 products are sold to protect our intellectual property. Intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in some countries because standards of registrability and ownership vary internationally. Consequently, in certain foreign jurisdictions, we have elected or may elect not to apply for trademark registrations. Also, in certain jurisdictions, as described above, certain H by Halston and H Halston trademark registrations or applications that we purchased (including but not limited to those based upon \u201cintent to use\u201d) may not yet be recorded in our name, due to laws governing the timing and nature of certain trademark assignments. Where laws limit our ability to record in our name trademarks that we have purchased, we have obtained by way of license all necessary rights to operate our business.\nWhile we generally apply for trademarks in most countries where we license or intend to license our trademarks, we may not accurately predict all of the countries where trademark protection will ultimately be desirable. If we fail to timely file a trademark application in any such country, we may be precluded from obtaining a trademark registration in such country at a later date. Failure to adequately pursue and enforce our trademark rights could damage our brands, enable others to compete with our brands and impair our ability to compete effectively.\nIn addition, in the future, we may be required to assert infringement claims against third parties or more third parties may assert infringement claims against us. Any resulting litigation or proceeding could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our management personnel, whether or not such litigation or proceeding is determined in our favor. To the extent that any of our trademarks were ever deemed to violate the proprietary rights of others in any litigation or proceeding or as a result of any claim, we may be prevented from using them, which could cause a termination of our licensing arrangements, and thus our revenue stream, with respect to those trademarks. Litigation could also result in a judgment or monetary damages being levied against us.\nWe are dependent upon our Chief Executive Officer and other key executives. If we lose the services of these individuals we may not be able to fully implement our business plan and future growth strategy, which would harm our business and prospects.\nOur success as a marketer and licensor of intellectual property is largely dependent upon the efforts of Robert D\u2019Loren, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our board of directors. Our continued success is largely dependent upon his continued efforts and those of our other key executives. Although we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. D\u2019Loren, as well as employment agreements with other key executives and employees, including Isaac Mizrahi and Judith Ripka, such persons can terminate their employment with us at their option, and there is no guarantee that we will not lose the services of our executive officers or key employees. To the extent that any of their services become unavailable to us, we will be required to hire other qualified executives, and we may not be successful in finding or hiring adequate replacements. This could impede our ability to fully implement our business plan and future growth strategy, which would harm our business and prospects. In addition, Bank Hapoalim B.M. requires that Robert D\u2019Loren is the Chairman of the board of directors of the Company. The failure of Mr. D\u2019Loren to continue in his duties as Chairman of our board of directors would result in a default under the credit facility with Bank Hapoalim B.M.\nOur trademarks and other intangible assets are subject to impairment charges under accounting guidelines.\nIntangible assets, including our trademarks and goodwill represent a substantial portion of our assets. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d), indefinite lived intangible assets, including our trademarks and goodwill, are not amortized, but must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the asset may be impaired. The estimated useful life of an intangible asset must be evaluated each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. Definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Any write-down of intangible assets resulting from future periodic evaluations would, as applicable, either decrease our net income or increase our net loss and those decreases or increases could be material.\nChanges in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results.\nOur future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or by a change in allocation of state and local jurisdictions, or interpretations thereof. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of recovering the amount of deferred tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from examinations by various taxing authorities in order to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We cannot guarantee that the outcomes of these evaluations and continuous examinations will not harm our reported operating results and financial conditions.\nWe must successfully maintain and/or upgrade our information technology systems.\nWe rely on various information technology systems to manage our operations, which subject us to inherent costs and risks associated with maintaining, upgrading, replacing and changing these systems, including impairment of our information technology, potential disruption of our internal control systems, substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and other risks of delays or difficulties in upgrading, transitioning to new systems or of integrating new systems into our current systems.\nWe have an ever-growing reliance on technology, including web-based information, proprietary data storage and normal business operations, which creates increased risk for us to ensure these systems remain uncompromised.\nAlthough we have never been subject of a cyber-attack, threats of cyber-attacks have expanded significantly across industries. Given the potential material impact on operations, any failure to protect the security of these digital technologies from internal and external threat could disrupt services and lead to misusage and \u201cleakage\u201d that could lead to significant capital outlays.\nA decline in general economic conditions resulting in a decrease in consumer spending levels and an inability to access capital may adversely affect our business.\nMany economic factors beyond our control may impact our forecasts and actual performance. These factors include consumer confidence, consumer spending levels, employment levels, or availability of consumer credit, recession, deflation, inflation, a general slowdown of the U.S. economy or an uncertain economic outlook. Furthermore, changes in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to potential sources of capital for future acquisitions.\nThe risks associated with our business are more acute during periods of economic slowdown or recession. In addition to other consequences, these periods may be accompanied by decreased consumer spending generally, as well as decreased demand for, or additional downward pricing pressure on, the products carrying our brands. Accordingly, any prolonged economic slowdown or a lengthy or severe recession with respect to either the U.S. or the global economy is likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Securities\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or in a timely fashion, and we may not be able to prevent fraud. In such case, our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and could negatively impact the price of our stock.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to include in our Annual Report on Form 10-K our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We have dedicated a significant amount of time and resources to ensure compliance with this legislation for the year ended December 31, 2015 and will continue to do so for future fiscal periods. We cannot be certain that future material changes to our internal control over financial reporting will be effective. If we cannot adequately maintain the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock. Moreover, if we discover a material weakness, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, could reduce the market\u2019s confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d At such time that an attestation is required, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse or qualified in the event that they are not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating. Our remediation efforts may not enable us to avoid a material weakness or significant deficiency in the future.\nThe JOBS Act allows us to postpone the date by which we must comply with certain laws and regulations and to reduce the amount of information provided in reports filed with the SEC. We cannot be certain whether the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are and we will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual revenues equal or exceed $1 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the first date of sales of securities pursuant to a registration statement, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. For so long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, we may continue to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on some or all of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. If we avail ourselves of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements, our reduced disclosure may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate us and may result in less investor confidence.\nManagement exercises significant control over matters requiring shareholder approval which may result in the delay or prevention of a change in our control.\nPursuant to a voting agreement, IM Ready-Made, LLC, Isaac Mizrahi and Marisa Gardini agreed to appoint a person designated by our board of directors as their collective irrevocable proxy and attorney-in-fact with respect to the shares of the common stock received by them. The proxy holder will vote in favor of matters recommended or approved by the board of directors. The board of directors has designated Robert D\u2019Loren as proxy. Also, pursuant to separate voting agreements, each of Ripka and HIP agreed to appoint Mr. D\u2019Loren as their respective irrevocable proxy and attorney-in-fact with respect to the shares of the common stock issued to them by us. The proxy holder shall vote in favor of matters recommended or approved by the board of directors.\nThe combined voting power of the common stock ownership of our officers, directors and key employees is approximately 63% of our voting securities as of December 31, 2015. As a result, our management and key employees through such stock ownership will exercise significant influence over all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of our directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership in management and key employees may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us that may be otherwise viewed as beneficial by stockholders other than management. There is also a risk that our existing management and a limited number of stockholders may have interests which are different from certain stockholders and that they will pursue an agenda which is beneficial to themselves at the expense of other stockholders.\nThere are limitations on the liabilities of our directors and executive officers. Under certain circumstances, we are obligated to indemnify our directors and executive officers against liability and expenses incurred by them in their service to us.\nPursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and under Delaware law, our directors are not liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty, except for liability for breach of a director\u2019s duty of loyalty, acts or omissions by a director not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, dividend payments or stock repurchases that are unlawful under Delaware law or any transaction in which a director has derived an improper personal benefit. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers. These agreements, among other things, require us to indemnify each director and executive officer for certain expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees, judgments, fines and settlement amounts, incurred by any such person in any action or proceeding, including any action by us or in our right, arising out of the person\u2019s services as one of our directors or executive officers. The costs associated with providing indemnification under these agreements could be harmful to our business and have an adverse effect on results of operations.\nOur common stock is currently thinly traded, and you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if you need to sell or liquidate a substantial number of shares at one time.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market, our common stock is currently traded at relatively low volumes. As a result, the number of persons interested in purchasing our common stock at or near bid prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation is attributable to a number of factors, including the fact prior to September 2011, we did not have an operating business, and that we are currently a small company which is still relatively unknown to securities analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we become more seasoned and viable. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. We cannot provide any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained, or that trading levels will be sustained.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nCurrently the publicly traded shares of our common stock are not widely held, and do not have significant trading volume, and therefore may experience significant price and volume fluctuations. Although our common stock is quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market, this does not assure that a meaningful, consistent trading market will develop or that the volatility will decline. This market volatility could reduce the market price of the common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, the trading price of the common stock could change significantly over short periods of time in response to actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results, announcements by us, our licensees or our respective competitors, factors affecting our licensees\u2019 markets generally and/or changes in national or regional economic conditions, making it more difficult for shares of the common stock to be sold at a favorable price or at all. The market price of the common stock could also be reduced by general market price declines or market volatility in the future or future declines or volatility in the prices of stocks for companies in the trademark licensing business or companies in the industries in which our licensees compete.\nOur common stock may be subject to the penny stock rules adopted by the SEC that require brokers to provide extensive disclosure to their customers prior to executing trades in penny stocks. These disclosure requirements may cause a reduction in the trading activity of our common stock, which could make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their securities.\nRule 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act establishes the definition of a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d for purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a minimum bid price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to a limited number of exceptions, including having securities registered on certain national securities exchanges. If our common stock were delisted from the NASDAQ, market liquidity for our common stock could be severely and adversely affected.\nFor any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the penny stock rules require that a broker or dealer approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks and the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. In order to approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must obtain financial information and investment experience and objectives of the person and make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and that that person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.\nThe broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form, sets forth:\n\u2022 the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and\n\u2022 that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction.\nDisclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and commission payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nBecause of these regulations, broker-dealers may not wish to engage in the above-referenced necessary paperwork and disclosures and/or may encounter difficulties in their attempt to sell shares of our common stock, which may affect the ability of selling stockholders or other holders to sell their shares in any secondary market and have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in any secondary market. These additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our common stock even if and when our common stock becomes listed on the NASDAQ Global Market. In addition, the liquidity for our common stock may decrease, with a corresponding decrease in the price of our common stock.\nAlthough our common stock closed at $5.25 per share on March 10, 2016, no assurance can be given that the per share price of our common stock will maintain such levels or that our stock will not be subject to these \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules in the future.\nInvestors should be aware that, according to Commission Release No. 34-29093, the market for \u201cpenny stocks\u201d has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include: (1) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (2) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (3) boiler room practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (4) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differential and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (5) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequent investor losses. The occurrence of these patterns or practices could increase the future volatility of our share price.\nWe may issue a substantial number of shares of common stock upon exercise of outstanding warrants and options, as payment of our obligations under the IM Seller Note, the Ripka Seller Notes and to satisfy obligations to IM Ready, Ripka and HIP if certain conditions, including royalty revenue targets, are met.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding warrants and options to purchase 2,699,043 shares of our common stock, of which warrants to purchase 582,428 shares are exercisable at a price of $0.01 per share. The holders of warrants and options will likely exercise such securities at a time when the market price of our common stock exceeds the exercise price. Therefore, exercises of warrants and options will result in a decrease in the net tangible book value per share of our common stock and such decrease could be material. In addition, we may issue shares of common stock to satisfy up to $5 million of earn-out payments to the Ripka brand\u2019s seller if royalty revenue targets are met by the Ripka business, and we may issue shares of common stock to satisfy two times the highest amount of annual excess royalties for C Wonder brand earned through June 30, 2019 to the C Wonder brand\u2019s sellers. As of December 31, 2015, we estimate the combined fair value of the earn-out payments to be $6.63 million.\nWe may also satisfy up to $4.38 million principal amount of the IM Seller Note payable to IM Ready by issuing shares of common stock. The number of shares which we issue to satisfy our obligations under the note will be based on the future market price of our common stock and is currently not determinable, provided that there is a floor to the share price to satisfy the IM Seller Note of $4.50 per share. The maximum number of shares that could be issued in exchange for the IM Seller Note is 972,763 shares.\nWe may also satisfy our obligations under the $0.59 million remaining principal amount Ripka Seller Notes payable to Ripka by issuing shares of common stock. The number of shares which we issue to satisfy our earn-out payment obligations or obligations under the Ripka Seller Notes will be based on the future market price of our common stock and are currently not determinable, provided that there is a floor to the share price to satisfy the Ripka Seller Notes of $7.00 per share. The maximum number of shares that could be issued in exchange for the remaining Ripka Seller Notes and the Ripka earn-out payments is 84,923 shares and 714,286 shares, respectively.\nThe issuance of shares to satisfy such obligations and upon exercise of outstanding warrants and options will dilute our then-existing stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership of our company, and such dilution could be substantial. In addition, our growth strategy includes the acquisition of additional brands, and we may issue shares of our common stock as consideration for acquisitions. Sales or the potential for sale of a substantial number of such shares could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, particularly if our common stock remains thinly traded at such time.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we have an aggregate of 3,192,828 shares of common stock available for grants under our Plan to our directors, executive officers, employees and consultants. Issuances of common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options or other stock grants or awards which may be granted under our Plan will dilute your interest in us.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock.\nYou should not rely on an investment in our common stock to provide dividend income, as we have not paid dividends on our common stock, and we do not plan to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Instead, we plan to retain any earnings to maintain and expand our existing licensing operations, further develop our trademarks and finance the acquisition of additional trademarks. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any return on their investment. In addition, our credit facility with Bank Hapoalim B.M. limits the amount of cash dividends we may pay while amounts under the credit facility are outstanding.\nProvisions of our corporate charter documents could delay or prevent change of control.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval, in one or more series, and to fix the dividend rights, terms, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption rights and terms, liquidation preferences, and any other rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions applicable to each new series of preferred stock. The designation of preferred stock in the future could make it difficult for third parties to gain control of our company, prevent or substantially delay a change in control, discourage bids for the common stock at a premium, or otherwise adversely affect the market price of the common stock.\nHolders of our common stock may be subject to restrictions on the use of Rule 144 by shell companies or former shell companies.\nHistorically, the SEC has taken the position that Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, is not available for the resale of securities initially issued by companies that are, or previously were, shell companies like us, to their promoters or affiliates despite technical compliance with the requirements of Rule 144. The SEC prohibits the use of Rule 144 for resale of securities issued by shell companies (other than business transaction related shell companies) or issuers that have been at any time previously a shell company. The SEC has provided an important exception to this prohibition, however, if the following conditions are met: the issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased to be a shell company; the issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; the issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports and material required to be filed, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than Form 8-K reports; and at least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current Form 10 type information with the SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company. As such, due to the fact that we had been a shell company prior to September 2011, holders of \u201crestricted securities\u201d within the meaning of Rule 144, when reselling their shares pursuant to Rule 144, shall be subject to the conditions set forth herein.", "PERMNO": 15543, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "XELB"}
