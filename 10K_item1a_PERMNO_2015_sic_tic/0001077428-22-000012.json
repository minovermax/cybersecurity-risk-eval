The following discussion, along with management\u2019s discussion and analysis and our financial statements and footnotes, sets forth the most significant risks and uncertainties that we believe could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or that management currently deems immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. There is no assurance that this discussion covers all potential risks that we face. The occurrence of the described risks could cause our results to differ materially from those described in our forward-looking statements included elsewhere in this report or in our other filings with the SEC, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of the most significant risks and uncertainties that we believe could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition to the following summary, you should consider the other information set forth in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and the other information contained in this report before investing in our securities.\nCredit Risks\n\u2022We must effectively manage our credit risks.\n\u2022A significant portion of our assets consists of commercial loans, which involve a high degree of credit risk.\n\u2022We are subject to risks arising from conditions in the real estate market, as a significant portion of our loans are secured by commercial and residential real estate.\n\u2022Our future profitability depends, to a significant extent, upon our commercial business customers.\n\u2022Our business is concentrated in Texas; our energy industry exposure could adversely affect our performance.\n\u2022We are subject to certain other risks related to our transition away from our mortgage correspondent aggregation business.\n\u2022We must effectively manage our counterparty risk.\n\u2022We must maintain an appropriate allowance for credit losses.\n\u2022Changes in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results.\nLiquidity Risks\n\u2022We must effectively manage our liquidity risk.\n\u2022Our growth plans are dependent on the availability of capital and funding.\n\u2022We are dependent on funds obtained from borrowing or capital transactions or from our Bank to fund our obligations.\nMarket Risks\n\u2022We must effectively manage our interest rate risks.\n\u2022We may be adversely affected by the transition away from LIBOR for our variable rate loans, derivative contracts and other financial assets and liabilities.\nStrategic Risks\n\u2022We must be effective in developing and executing new lines of business and new products and services while managing associated risks.\n\u2022We compete with many banks and other financial service providers.\n\u2022We must effectively execute our business strategy in order to continue our asset and earnings growth.\nOperational Risks\n\u2022We, our vendors and customers must effectively manage our information systems and cyber risk which may experience disruption, failure or breach in security.\n\u2022Our operations rely extensively on a broad range of external vendors.\n\u2022We must continue to attract, retain and develop key personnel.\n\u2022Our accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on management judgment, which may prove inadequate or be adversely impacted by inaccurate assumptions or models.\n\u2022Our risk management strategies and processes may not be effective; our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\n\u2022Our business is susceptible to fraud.\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\n\u2022We are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision.\n\u2022We must maintain adequate regulatory capital to support our business objectives.\n\u2022We are subject to claims and litigation in the ordinary course of our business, including claims that may not be covered by our insurers.\nOther Risks Affecting Our Business\n\u2022Our business faces unpredictable economic and business conditions.\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting us and our customers, employees and third-party service providers, and the adverse impacts on our business, financial position, operations and prospects have been and are expected to continue to be significant.\n\u2022The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\n\u2022The impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) on us and our customers contributes to uncertainty and risk related to our customers\u2019 future demand for credit and our future results.\n\u2022We are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\n\u2022Severe weather, earthquakes, other natural disasters, pandemics, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business.\n\u2022Climate change has the potential to disrupt our business and adversely impact the operations and creditworthiness of our clients.\n\u2022Climate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may result in operational changes and expenditures that could significantly impact our business.\n\u2022Negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely affect our earnings.\nRisks Relating to Our Securities\n\u2022Our stock price can be volatile.\n\u2022The trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies.\n\u2022Our preferred stock is thinly traded.\n\u2022An investment in our securities is not an insured deposit.\n\u2022The holders of our indebtedness and preferred stock have rights that are senior to those of our common stockholders.\n\u2022We do not currently pay dividends on our common stock.\n\u2022Federal legislation and regulations impose restrictions on the ownership of our common stock.\n\u2022Anti-takeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law may make it more difficult for you to receive a change in control premium.\n\u2022Our Bank is subject to regulatory and contractual limitations on the payment of its subordinated notes.\nRisk Factors Associated with Our Business\nCredit Risks\nWe must effectively manage our credit risks. The risk of non-payment of loans is inherent in commercial banking, which may result from many factors, including:\n\u2022Adverse changes in local, U.S. and global economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022Business and market disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and governmental restrictions imposed in response to the pandemic;\n\u2022Declines in the value of collateral, including asset values that are directly or indirectly related to external factors such as commodity prices, real estate values or interest rates;\n\u2022Concentrations of credit associated with specific loan categories, industries or collateral types; and\n\u2022Exposures to individual borrowers and to groups of entities that may be affiliated on some basis that individually and/or collectively represent a larger percentage of our total loans or capital than might be considered common at other banks of similar size.\nWe rely heavily on information provided by third parties when originating and monitoring loans. If this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and we do not detect such misrepresentations, the credit risk associated with the transaction may be increased. Although we attempt to manage our credit risk by carefully monitoring the concentration of our loans within specific loan categories and industries and through prudent loan approval and monitoring practices in all categories of our lending, we cannot assure you that our approval and monitoring procedures will reduce these lending risks. Our significant number of large credit relationships (above $20 million) could exacerbate credit problems precipitated by a regional or national economic downturn. Competitive pressures could erode underwriting standards, leading to a decline in general credit quality and increases in credit defaults and non-performing asset levels. If our credit portfolio management routines, policies and procedures are not able to adequately adapt to changes in economic, competitive or other conditions that affect customers and the quality of the loan portfolio, we may incur increased losses that could adversely affect our financial results and lead to increased regulatory scrutiny, restrictions on our lending activity or financial penalties.\nA significant portion of our assets consists of commercial loans, which involve a high degree of credit risk. We generally invest a greater proportion of our assets in commercial loans to business customers than other banking institutions of our size, and our business plan calls for continued efforts to increase our assets invested in these loans. At December 31, 2021, approximately 43% of our portfolio of loans held for investment was comprised of commercial loans. Commercial loans may involve a higher degree of credit risk than other types of loans due, in part, to their larger average size, the effects of changing economic conditions on the businesses of our commercial loan customers, the dependence of borrowers on operating cash flow to service debt and our reliance upon collateral which may not be readily marketable. Due to the greater proportion of these commercial loans in our portfolio and because the balances of these loans are, on average, larger than other categories of loans, losses incurred on a relatively small number of commercial loans could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks arising from conditions in the real estate market, as a significant portion of our loans are secured by commercial and residential real estate. At December 31, 2021, approximately 54% of our loans held for investment portfolio was comprised of loans with real estate as the primary component of collateral. Our real estate lending activities, and our exposure to fluctuations in real estate collateral values, are significant and may increase as our assets increase. The market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a relatively short period of time as a result of market conditions in the geographic area in which the real estate is located, in response to factors such as economic downturns, changes in the economic health of industries heavily concentrated in a particular area and in response to changes in market interest rates, which influence capitalization rates used to value revenue-generating commercial real estate. If the value of real estate serving as collateral for\nour loans declines materially, a significant part of our loan portfolio could become under-collateralized and losses incurred upon borrower defaults would increase. Conditions in certain segments of the real estate industry, including homebuilding, lot development and mortgage lending, may have an effect on values of real estate pledged as collateral for our loans. The inability of purchasers of real estate, including residential real estate, to obtain financing may weaken the financial condition of our borrowers who are dependent on the sale or refinancing of property to repay their loans. Changes in the economic health of certain industries can have a significant impact on other sectors or industries which are directly or indirectly associated with those industries, and may impact the value of real estate in areas where such industries are concentrated.\nOur future profitability depends, to a significant extent, upon our commercial business customers. Our future profitability depends, to a significant extent, upon revenue we receive from commercial business customers, and their ability to continue to meet their loan obligations. Adverse economic conditions or other factors affecting this market segment, and our failure to timely identify and react to unexpected economic downturns, may have a greater adverse effect on us than on other financial institutions that have a more diversified customer base. Additionally, our inability to grow our commercial business customer base in a highly competitive market could affect our future growth and profitability.\nOur business is concentrated in Texas; our energy industry exposure could adversely affect our performance. Although more than 50% of our loan exposure is outside of Texas and more than 50% of our deposits are sourced outside of Texas, our Texas concentration remains significant compared to other peer banks. A majority of our loans held for investment, excluding mortgage finance loans and other national lines of business, are to businesses with headquarters or operations in Texas. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations may be strongly affected by any prolonged period of economic recession or other adverse business, economic or regulatory conditions affecting Texas businesses and financial institutions. While the Texas economy is more diversified than in the 1980s, the energy sector continues to play an important role. At December 31, 2021, our outstanding energy loans represented 3% of total loans held for investment. Furthermore, energy production and related industries represent a significant part of the economies in some of the primary markets in which we operate. Our energy loans consist primarily of producing reserve-based loans to exploration and production companies, with a smaller portion of our loan balances attributable to royalty owners, midstream operators, saltwater disposal and other service companies whose businesses primarily relate to production, not exploration and development, of oil and gas. These businesses are significantly affected by volatility in oil and natural gas prices, reserve depletion curves, material declines in the level of drilling and production activity in Texas and in other areas of the United States and material fluctuations in investor interest in oil and gas exploration and production investments. There is no assurance that we will not be materially adversely impacted by the direct and indirect effects of current and future conditions in the energy industry in Texas and nationally.\nWe are subject to certain other risks related to our transition away from our mortgage correspondent aggregation business. In 2015, we launched our MCA business, a correspondent lending program that complemented our mortgage warehouse lending business. On April 20, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell our portfolio of mortgage servicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d) and to transition the MCA program to a third-party. At December 31, 2021, we have $8.1 million in loans held for sale remaining on our balance sheet. Volatility in the mortgage industry has caused uncertainty related to the pricing of these mortgage loans when they are sold or securitized. This volatility may cause the actual returns on mortgage sales or securitization transactions to be less than anticipated.\nWe are from time to time required to hold or repurchase mortgage loans or reimburse investors as a result of breaches in contractual representations and warranties under the agreements pursuant to which we purchase and sell mortgage loans. While our agreements with the originators and sellers of mortgage loans provide us with legal recourse against them that may allow us to recover some or all of our losses, these companies are frequently not financially capable of paying large amounts of damages and as a result we can offer no assurance that we will not bear all of the risk of loss.\nWe must effectively manage our counterparty risk. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. Our Bank has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other financial market participants. Many of these transactions expose our Bank to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our Bank\u2019s credit risk may be increased when the collateral securing its loans cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of its credit or derivative exposure. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe must maintain an appropriate allowance for credit losses. Our experience in the banking industry indicates that some portion of our loans will become delinquent, and some may only be partially repaid or may never be repaid at all. We maintain an allowance for credit losses on loans, which is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense each quarter, that is consistent with management\u2019s assessment of the collectability of the loan portfolio in light of the amount of loans committed and outstanding and current and future economic conditions and market trends. When specific loan losses are identified, the amount of the expected loss is removed, or charged off, from the allowance. Our methodology for establishing the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on loans depends on our subjective application of risk grades as indicators\nof each borrower\u2019s ability to repay specific loans, together with our assessment of how actual or projected changes in competitor underwriting practices, competition for borrowers and depositors and other conditions in our markets are likely to impact improvement or deterioration in the collectability of our loans as compared to our historical experience.\nOur business model makes our Bank more vulnerable to changes in underlying business credit quality than other banks with which we compete. We have a substantially larger percentage of commercial, real estate and other categories of business loans relative to total assets than most other banks in our market and our individual loans are generally larger as a percentage of our total earning assets than other banks. We have substantially increased our liquidity in recent years, and these funds have primarily been invested in low-yielding deposits with federal agencies and other financial institutions. And, we have had a substantially smaller portion of our assets consist of securities and other earning asset categories that can be less vulnerable to changes in local, regional or industry-specific economic trends, causing our potential for credit losses to be more severe than other banks. During 2021, these balances have remained elevated, although they have begun to run off as we have purchased investment securities and proactively exited certain high-cost indexed deposit products; however, the most significant portion of earning assets still remains in loans. The failure to maintain above-peer credit quality metrics would have a material adverse impact on our growth and profitability. Historically, we have sought to take action prior to economic downturns by slowing growth rates and decreasing the risk level of our assets by, among other things, allowing runoff of loans that we believe may not perform well during a weakening or declining economic environment.\nIf our assessment of inherent risk and losses in our loan portfolio is inaccurate, or economic and market conditions or our borrowers' financial performance experience material unanticipated changes, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the allowance may become inadequate, requiring larger provisions for loan losses that can materially decrease our earnings. Certain of our loans individually represent a significant percentage of our total allowance for credit losses. Adverse collection experience in a relatively small number of these loans could require an increase in the provision for credit losses. Federal regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and, based on their judgments, which may be different than ours, may require us to change classifications or grades of loans, increase the allowance for credit losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in the allowance for credit losses or in the amount of loan charge-offs required by our methodology or regulatory agencies could have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results. The Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC may change the financial accounting and reporting standards, or the interpretation of those standards, that govern the preparation of our external financial statements from time to time. The impact of these changes or the application thereof on our financial condition and operations can be difficult to predict.\nFor example, we adopted ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) on January 1, 2020 which replaced the incurred loss methodology for determining our provision for credit losses and allowance for credit losses with the CECL model. Implementation of CECL requires that we determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected future credit losses on loans in the provision for credit losses in the period when the loans are booked. Our adoption of CECL resulted in an increase to the allowance for credit losses by $9.1 million. The impact of CECL in future periods will be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of our loan portfolio, as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts utilized. Should these factors materially change, we may be required to increase or decrease our allowance for credit losses, decreasing or increasing our reported income, and introducing additional volatility into our reported earnings.\nLiquidity Risks\nWe must effectively manage our liquidity risk. Our Bank requires liquidity in the form of available funds to meet deposit, debt and other obligations as they come due, borrower requests to draw on committed credit facilities as well as unexpected demands for cash payments. While we are not subject to Basel III liquidity regulations, the adequacy of our liquidity is a matter of regulatory interest given the significant portion of our balance sheet represented by loans as opposed to securities and other more marketable investments. Our Bank\u2019s principal source of funding consists of customer deposits, supplemented by our short-term and long-term borrowings, including federal funds purchased and FHLB borrowings. We also rely on the availability of the mortgage secondary market provided by Ginnie Mae and the GSEs to support the liquidity of our residential mortgage assets. A substantial majority of our Bank\u2019s liabilities consist of demand, savings, checking and money market deposits, which are payable on demand or upon relatively short notice. By comparison, a substantial portion of our assets are loans, most of which, excluding our mortgage finance loans and mortgage loans held for sale, cannot be collected or sold in so short a time frame, creating the potential for an imbalance in the availability of liquid assets to satisfy depositors and loan funding requirements.\nWe have historically held smaller balances of marketable securities than many of our competitors, limiting our ability to increase our liquidity by completing market sales of these assets. During 2020 and continuing into 2021, we deployed some of our excess liquidity into marketable securities. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of securities and loans and other sources, or an inability to access the capital markets, could have a substantial negative effect on our Bank\u2019s liquidity. We actively manage our available sources of funds to meet our expected needs under normal and financially stressed conditions, but there is no assurance that our Bank will be able to make new loans, meet ongoing funding commitments to\nborrowers and replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary under all possible circumstances. Our Bank\u2019s ability to obtain funding could be impaired by factors beyond its control, such as disruptions in financial markets, negative expectations regarding the financial services industry generally or in our markets or negative perceptions of our Bank, including our credit ratings.\nOur Bank sources a significant volume of its demand deposits from financial services companies, mortgage finance customers and other commercial sources, resulting in a larger percentage of large deposits and a smaller number of sources of deposits than would be typical of other banks in our markets, creating concentrations of deposits that carry a greater risk of unexpected material withdrawals. In recent periods, over half of our total deposits have been attributable to customers whose balances exceed the $250,000 FDIC insurance limit. Many of these customers actively monitor our financial condition and results of operations and could withdraw their deposits quickly upon the occurrence of a material adverse development affecting our Bank or their businesses. Significant deterioration in our credit quality or a downgrade in our credit ratings could affect funding sources such as financial institutions and broker dealers. In response to this risk, we have increased our liquidity and developed more sophisticated techniques for monitoring and planning for changes in liquidity and capital over the past several years, but there is no assurance that we will maintain or have access to sufficient funding and capital to fully mitigate our liquidity risk.\nOne potential source of liquidity for our Bank consists of \u201cbrokered deposits\u201d arranged by brokers acting as intermediaries, typically larger money-center financial institutions. We receive deposits provided by certain of our customers in connection with our delivery of other financial services to them or their customers which are subject to regulatory classification as \u201cbrokered deposits\u201d even though we consider these to be relationship deposits and they are not subject to the typical risks or market pricing associated with conventional brokered deposits.\nIf we do not maintain our regulatory capital above the level required to be well capitalized we would be required to obtain FDIC consent for us to continue to accept, renew or roll over most deposits classified as brokered deposits, and there can be no assurance that the FDIC would consent under any circumstances. We could also be required to suspend or eliminate deposit gathering from any source classified as \u201cbrokered\u201d deposits. The FDIC can change the definition of brokered deposits or extend the classification to deposits not currently classified as brokered deposits. These non-traditional deposits are subject to greater operational and reputational risk of unexpected withdrawal than traditional demand and time deposits, particularly those provided by consumers. A significant decrease in our balances of relationship brokered deposits could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and results of operations. See Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations below for further discussion of our liquidity.\nOur growth plans are dependent on the availability of capital and funding. Our historical ability to raise capital through the sale of capital stock and debt securities may be affected by economic and market conditions or regulatory changes that are beyond our control. Adverse changes in our operating performance or financial condition could make raising additional capital difficult or more expensive or limit our access to customary sources of funding, including inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from a Federal Reserve Bank (\u201cFRB\u201d) or the Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d). Unexpected changes in requirements for capital resulting from regulatory actions could require us to raise capital at a time, and at a price, that might be unfavorable, or could require that we forego continuing growth or reduce our current loan portfolio. We cannot offer assurance that capital and funding will be available to us in the future, in needed amounts, upon acceptable terms or at all. Our efforts to raise capital could require the issuance of securities at times and with maturities, conditions and rates that are disadvantageous, and which could have a dilutive impact on our current stockholders. Factors that could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or necessary funding include conditions in the capital markets, our financial performance, our credit ratings, regulatory actions and general economic conditions. Increases in our cost of capital, including dilution and increased interest or dividend requirements, could have a direct adverse impact on our operating performance and our ability to achieve our growth objectives. Trust preferred securities are no longer viable as a source of new long-term debt capital as a result of regulatory changes. The treatment of our existing trust preferred securities as capital may be subject to further regulatory change prior to their maturity, which could require the Company to seek additional capital.\nOur mortgage finance business has experienced, and will likely continue to experience, highly variable usage of our funding capacity resulting from seasonal demands for credit, surges in consumer demand driven by changes in interest rates and month-end \u201cspikes\u201d of residential mortgage closings. These spikes could also result in our Bank having capital ratios that are below internally targeted levels or even levels that could cause our Bank to not be well capitalized and could affect liquidity levels. At the same time, managing this risk by declining to respond fully to the needs of our customers could severely impact our business. We have responded to these variable funding demands by, among other things, increasing the extent of participations sold in our mortgage loan interests, as needed, and by maintaining a substantial borrowing relationship with the FHLB. Our mortgage finance customers have in recent periods provided significant low-cost deposit balances associated with the borrower escrow accounts created at the time certain mortgage loans are funded, which have benefitted our liquidity and net interest margin. In response to competitive pressures, we sometimes find it necessary to pay interest on some of these accounts, as regulations allow or require and this trend may continue, which can affect our ability to reduce our costs of funds. Individual escrow account balances also experience significant variability monthly as principal and interest payments, as well as ad valorem taxes and insurance premiums, are paid periodically. While the short average holding period of our mortgage interests\nof approximately 20 days will allow us, if necessitated by a funding shortfall, to rapidly decrease the size of the portfolio and its associated capital and funding requirements, any such action might significantly damage our business and important mortgage finance relationships.\nWe are dependent on funds obtained from borrowing or capital transactions or from our Bank to fund our obligations. We are a financial holding company engaged in the business of managing, controlling and operating our Bank. We conduct no material business or other activity at the parent company level other than activities incidental to holding equity and debt investments in our Bank. As a result, we rely on the proceeds of capital transactions, borrowings under our revolving line of credit, payments of interest and principal on loans made to our Bank and dividends on preferred stock issued by our Bank to pay our operating expenses, to satisfy our obligations to debtholders and to pay dividends on our preferred stock. The profitability of our Bank is subject to fluctuation based upon, among other things, the cost and availability of funds, changes in interest rates and economic conditions in general. Our Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to us is subject to regulatory limitations that can, under certain adverse circumstances, prohibit the payment of dividends to us. Our right to participate in any distribution from the liquidation or sale of our Bank\u2019s assets is subject to the prior claims of our Bank\u2019s creditors.\nIf we are unable to access funds from capital transactions, borrowing under our revolving line of credit or dividends or interest on loan payments from our Bank, we may be unable to satisfy our obligations to creditors or debtholders or pay dividends on our preferred stock. Changes in our Bank\u2019s operating results or capital requirements could require us to convert subordinated notes or preferred stock of our Bank held by us into common equity, reducing our cash flow available to meet our obligations.\nMarket Risks\nWe must effectively manage our interest rate risk. Our profitability is dependent to a large extent on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income paid to us on our loans and investments and the interest we pay to third parties such as our depositors, lenders and debtholders. Changes in interest rates can impact our profits and the fair values of certain of our assets and liabilities. Models that we use to forecast and plan for the impact of rising and falling interest rates may be incorrect or fail to consider the impact of competition and other conditions affecting our loans and deposits.\nPeriods of unusually low or volatile interest rates have a material effect on our earnings. During the first quarter of 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve reduced the target Federal Funds rate to between zero and 0.25%. At the most recent meeting, the Federal Reserve voted to maintain this target range, but indicated that the economic recovery pace was such that a rate increase was likely in early 2022 with additional rate increases to potentially follow.\nIncreases in interest rates and economic conditions affecting consumer demand for housing can have a material impact on the volume of mortgage originations and refinancings, adversely affecting the profitability of our mortgage finance business. Interest rate risk can also result from mismatches between the dollar amounts of repricing or maturing assets and liabilities and from mismatches in the timing and rates at which our assets and liabilities reprice. We actively monitor and manage the balances of our maturing and repricing assets and liabilities to reduce the adverse impact of changes in interest rates, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid material adverse effects on our net interest margin in all market conditions.\nRising interest rates in prior periods have increased our interest expense, with a commensurate adverse effect on our net interest income, and may be expected to do so in future periods. In a rising rate environment, competition for cost-effective deposits increase, making it more costly for us to fund loan growth. Rapid and unexpected volatility in interest rates creates additional uncertainty and potential for adverse financial effects. There can be no assurance that we will not be materially adversely affected by future changes in interest rates.\nWe may be adversely affected by the transition away from LIBOR for our variable rate loans, derivative contracts and other financial assets and liabilities. Our business relies upon a large volume of loans, derivative contracts and other financial instruments which are directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR to establish their interest rate and/or value. The administrator of LIBOR has proposed to extend publication of the most commonly used U.S. dollar LIBOR settings to June 30, 2023 and ceased publishing other LIBOR settings on December 31, 2021. The U.S. federal banking agencies issued guidance strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using U.S. dollar LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. We have significant exposure to financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR to establish their interest rate and/or value, some of which mature after December 31, 2021.\nWe have established a working group, consisting of key stakeholders from throughout the company, to monitor developments relating to LIBOR changes and to guide the Bank\u2019s response. This team is continuing to work to ensure that our technology systems are prepared for the transition, our loan documents that reference LIBOR-based rates have been appropriately amended to reference other methods of interest rate determinations and internal and external stakeholders are apprised of the transition. Based on our transition progress to date, we have ceased originating LIBOR-based products and began originating Bloomberg Short Term Yield Index based loans in December 2021. We are prepared with other alternative benchmarks, as necessary, to support the continued transition from LIBOR. Over the next 18 months, we will continue to transition all remaining LIBOR-based products to an alternative benchmark. We will also continue to evaluate the transition process and align our trajectory\nwith regulatory guidelines regarding the cessation of LIBOR as well as monitor new developments for transitioning to alternative reference rates. Any successor or replacement interest rates to LIBOR may perform differently, which may affect our net interest income, change our market risk profile and require changes to our risk, pricing and hedging strategies. Any failure to adequately manage this transition could adversely impact our reputation.\nStrategic Risks\nWe must be effective in developing and executing new lines of business and new products and services while managing associated risks. Our business strategy requires that we develop and grow new lines of business and offer new products and services within existing lines of business in order to ensure future client acquisition and retention of existing clients and realize our strategic priorities for both loans and deposits. Substantial costs, risks and uncertainties are associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. Developing and marketing new activities requires that we invest significant time and resources before new sources of revenues, funding and profits can be realized. Timetables for the development and launch of new activities may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible or their realization may be delayed. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, receipt of necessary licenses or permits, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also adversely impact the successful execution of new activities. New activities necessarily entail additional risks and may present additional risks to the effectiveness of our system of internal controls and risk management strategies. All service offerings, including current offerings and new activities, may become more risky due to changes in economic, competitive and market conditions beyond our control. Our regulators could determine that our risk management practices are not adequate or our capital levels are not sufficiently in excess of well capitalized levels and take action to restrain our growth. Failure to successfully manage these risks, generally and to the satisfaction of our regulators, in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe compete with many banks and other financial service providers. Competition among providers of financial services in our markets, in Texas, regionally and nationally, is intense. We compete with other financial and bank holding companies, state and national commercial banks, savings and loan associations, consumer finance companies, credit unions, securities brokerages, insurance companies, mortgage banking companies, money market mutual funds, asset-based non-bank lenders, government sponsored or subsidized lenders and other financial services providers. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial resources, lending limits and technological resources and larger branch networks than we do, and are able to offer a broader range of products and services than we can, including systems and services that could more effectively protect customers from cyber threats. Many competitors offer lower interest rates and more liberal loan terms that appeal to borrowers but adversely affect net interest margin and assurance of repayment. We are increasingly faced with competition in many of our products and services by non-bank providers who may have competitive advantages of size, access to potential customers and fewer regulatory requirements. Failure to compete effectively for deposit, loan and other banking customers in any of our lines of business could cause us to lose market share, slow or reverse our growth rate or suffer adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe must effectively execute our business strategy in order to continue our asset and earnings growth. Our core strategy is to develop our business principally through organic growth by offering a differentiated banking experience to companies in high-value business segments. Our prospects for continued growth must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by growing companies. In order to execute our business strategy successfully, we must, among other things:\n\u2022continue to identify and expand into suitable markets and lines of business, in Texas, regionally and nationally;\n\u2022develop new products and services and execute our full range of products and services more efficiently and effectively;\n\u2022attract and retain qualified bankers in each of our targeted market segments to build our customer base;\n\u2022respond to market opportunities promptly and nimbly while balancing the demands of risk management and compliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022expand our loan portfolio in an intensely competitive environment while maintaining credit quality;\n\u2022attract sufficient deposits and capital to fund our anticipated loan growth and satisfy regulatory requirements;\n\u2022control expenses; and\n\u2022acquire and maintain sufficient qualified staffing and information technology and operational resources to support growth and compliance with regulatory requirements.\nFailure to effectively execute our business strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business, future prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nOperational Risks\nWe, our vendors and customers must effectively manage our information systems and cyber risk which may experience disruption, failure or breach in security. We, our vendors and customers all rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our respective businesses, store sensitive data and work effectively together. The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our ability to use technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands. Many of our larger competitors invest substantially greater resources in technological capabilities than we do. We may not be able to effectively protect, develop and manage mission critical systems and IT infrastructure to support strategic business initiatives, which could impair our ability to achieve financial, operational, compliance and strategic objectives and negatively affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur communications and information systems and those of our vendors and customers remain vulnerable to unexpected disruptions, failures and cyber-attacks. Any disruption, failure or breach in security of these systems could result in significant disruption to our operations. Information security breaches and cyber-security-related incidents include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, including customer and company information, malicious code, computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events. These types of threats may derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of external or internal parties or may result from accidental technological failure. The risk, frequency and intensity of such attacks is escalating, including as a result of remote working arrangements implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication of these threats. Material failures or interruptions of these systems could impair our ability to serve our customers and to operate our business and could damage our reputation, result in a loss of business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or enforcement or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability. While we have developed extensive recovery plans, we cannot assure that those plans will be effective to prevent adverse effects upon us and our customers resulting from system failures.\nCloud technologies are also critical to the operation of our systems, and our reliance on cloud technologies is growing. Service disruptions in cloud technologies may lead to delays in accessing, or the loss of, data that is important to our businesses and may hinder our clients\u2019 access to our products and services.\nWe collect and store sensitive data, including personally identifiable information of our customers and employees and in the ordinary course of business must allow certain of our vendors access to that data. Breaches of our systems or our vendors' or customers\u2019 systems, thefts of data and other breaches and criminal activity may result in significant costs to respond, liability for customer losses if we or our vendors are at fault, damage to our customer relationships, regulatory scrutiny and enforcement and loss of future business opportunities due to reputational damage. Even the most well-protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly cyber-attacks and intrusions, or disruptions will occur in the future, and because the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.\nBreaches can be perpetrated by unknown third parties, but could also be facilitated by employees either inadvertently or by consciously attempting to create disruption or certain acts of fraud. Our customers and employees have been, and will continue to be, targeted by parties using fraudulent e-mails and other communications in attempts to misappropriate passwords, bank account information or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware through \u201cTrojan horse\u201d programs to our information systems, the information systems of our merchants or third-party service providers and/or our customers' computers. Although we, with the help of third-party service providers, will continue to implement information security technology solutions and establish operational procedures to protect sensitive data, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective. We advise and provide training to our customers and evaluate and impose security requirements on our vendors regarding protection of their respective information systems, but there is no assurance that these actions will have the intended positive effects or will be effective to prevent losses. In some cases we may elect to contribute to the cost of responding to cybercrime against our customers, even when we are not at fault, in order to maintain valuable customer relationships. Successful cyber-attacks on our Bank, vendors or customers may affect the reputation of our Bank, and failure to meet customer expectations could have a material impact on our ability to attract and retain deposits as a primary source of funding.\nA security breach or other significant disruption of our information systems or those related to our customers, merchants and our third-party vendors, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could (i) disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers; (ii) result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers; (iii) result in a violation of applicable privacy, data breach and other laws, subjecting us to additional regulatory\nscrutiny and exposing us to civil litigation, governmental fines and possible financial liability; (iv) require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; or (v) harm our reputation or cause a decrease in the number of customers that choose to do business with us. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations rely extensively on a broad range of external vendors. We rely on a large number of vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations, particularly in the areas of operations, treasury management systems, information technology and security. This reliance exposes us to the risk that these vendors will not perform as required by our agreements as well as risks resulting from disruptions in communications with our vendors, cyber-attacks and security breaches at our vendors, failure of a vendor to provide services for other reasons and poor performance of services. An external vendor\u2019s failure to perform in any of these areas could be disruptive to our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as cause reputational damage. External vendors who must have access to our information systems in order to provide their services have been identified as significant sources of information technology security risk. While we have implemented an active program of oversight to address this risk, there can be no assurance that we will not experience material security breaches associated with our vendors.\nWe must continue to attract, retain and develop key personnel. Our success depends to a significant extent upon our ability to attract, develop and retain experienced bankers in each of our lines of business and markets as well as managers in operational areas, compliance and other support areas to build and maintain the infrastructure and controls required to support continuing loan and deposit growth. Competition for the best people in our industry can be intense, and there is no assurance that we will continue to have the same level of success in this effort that has supported our historical results. Factors that affect our ability to attract, develop and retain key employees include our compensation and benefits programs, our profitability, our ability to establish appropriate succession plans for key talent, our reputation for rewarding and promoting qualified employees and market competition for employees with certain skills, including information systems development and security. The cost of employee compensation is a significant portion of our operating expenses and can materially impact our results of operations. The unanticipated loss of the services of key personnel could have an adverse effect on our business. Although we have entered into employment agreements with certain key employees, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in retaining them.\nOur accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on management judgment, which may prove inadequate or be adversely impacted by inaccurate assumptions or models. The processes we use to estimate expected credit losses for purposes of establishing the allowance for credit losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments, certain of our liquidity and capital planning tools, as well as the processes we use to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, all depend upon management\u2019s judgment. Management\u2019s judgment and the data relied upon by management may be based on assumptions that prove to be inaccurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Additionally, CECL requires the application of greater management judgment that is supported by new models and more data elements, including macroeconomic forecasts, than the previous allowance standard. Our adoption of the CECL model is expected to increase the complexity, and associated risk, of the analysis and processes relying on management judgment, which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur risk management strategies and processes may not be effective; our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented. We continue to invest in the development of risk management techniques, strategies, assessment methods and related controls and monitoring approaches on an ongoing basis. However, these risk management strategies and processes may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all economic market environments or against all types of risk. Any failures in our risk management strategies and processes to accurately identify, quantify and monitor our risk exposure could limit our ability to effectively manage our risks. Management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and management judgment and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is susceptible to fraud. Our business exposes us to fraud risk from our loan and deposit customers, the parties they do business with, as well as from our employees, contractors and vendors. We rely on financial and other data from new and existing customers which could turn out to be fraudulent when accepting such customers, executing their financial transactions and making and purchasing loans and other financial assets. In times of increased economic stress we are at increased risk of fraud losses. We believe we have underwriting and operational controls in place to prevent or detect such fraud, but we cannot provide assurance that these controls will be effective in detecting fraud or that we will not experience fraud losses or incur costs or other damage related to such fraud, at levels that adversely affect our financial results or reputation. Our lending customers may also experience fraud in their businesses which could adversely affect their ability to repay their loans or make use of our services. Our exposure and the exposure of our customers to fraud may increase our\nfinancial risk and reputation risk as it may result in unexpected loan losses that exceed those that have been provided for in our allowance for credit losses.\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision. We, as a bank holding company and financial holding company, and our Bank as a Texas state-chartered bank, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision, and the potential for regulatory enforcement actions, that impact our business on a daily basis. See the discussion above at Business - Regulation and Supervision. These regulations affect our lending practices, permissible products and services and their terms and conditions, customer relationships, capital structure, investment practices, accounting, financial reporting, operations and our ability to grow, among other things. These regulations also impose obligations to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identities of our customers.\nThe level of regulatory scrutiny that we are subject to may fluctuate over time, based on numerous factors. In addition, Congress, state legislatures, and federal and state regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Material changes in regulation and requirements imposed on financial institutions, such as the Dodd-Frank Act, Basel III Capital Rules, European Union's General Data Protection Regulations and California Consumer Privacy Act result in additional costs, impose more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and increase the ability of non-bank financial services providers to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Such changes could result in new regulatory obligations which could prove difficult, expensive or competitively impractical to comply with if not equally imposed upon non-bank financial services providers with whom we compete.\nWe are subject to a continuous program of examinations by our regulators concerning, among other things, lending practices, reserve methodology, compliance with changing regulations and interpretations, BSA/AML compliance, our management of interest rate, liquidity, capital and operational risk, enterprise risk management, regulatory and financial accounting practices and policies and related matters, which can divert management\u2019s time and attention from focusing on our business. We devote a significant amount of management time and expense to enhancing the infrastructure to support our compliance obligations, which can pose significant regulatory enforcement, financial and reputational risks if not appropriately addressed.\nThe Regulatory Relief Act passed on May 22, 2018, has provided a limited degree of regulatory relief for institutions of our size. Uncertainty regarding how our regulators will evaluate capital and liquidity planning going forward remains a risk. We continue to increase our capital and liquidity and expand our regulatory compliance staffing and systems in order to address continuing regulatory requirements. There is no assurance that our financial performance in future years will not be similarly burdened.\nWe expend substantial effort and incur costs to maintain and improve our systems, controls, accounting, operations, information security, compliance, audit effectiveness, analytical capabilities, staffing and training in order to satisfy regulatory requirements. We cannot offer assurance that these efforts will be accepted by our regulators as satisfying the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to us. Failure to comply with relevant laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur.\nWe must maintain adequate regulatory capital to support our business objectives. Under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements, we must satisfy capital requirements based upon quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items. Our satisfaction of these requirements is subject to qualitative judgments by regulators that may differ materially from management\u2019s and that are subject to being determined retroactively for prior periods. Additionally, regulators can make subjective assessments about the adequacy of capital levels, even if our Bank's reported capital exceeds the \u201cwell capitalized\u201d requirements. Our ability to maintain our status as a financial holding company and to continue to operate our Bank as we have in recent periods is dependent upon a number of factors, including our Bank qualifying as \u201cwell capitalized\u201d and \u201cwell managed\u201d under applicable prompt corrective action regulations and upon our company qualifying on an ongoing basis as \u201cwell capitalized\u201d and \u201cwell managed\u201d under applicable Federal Reserve regulations.\nFailure to meet regulatory capital standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, including damaging the confidence of customers in us, adversely impacting our reputation and competitive position and retention of key personnel. Any of these developments could limit our access to:\n\u2022brokered deposits;\n\u2022FRB discount window;\n\u2022advances from the FHLB;\n\u2022capital markets transactions; and\n\u2022development of new financial services.\nFailure to meet regulatory capital standards may also result in higher FDIC assessments. If we fall below guidelines for being deemed \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d the FDIC or Federal Reserve could impose restrictions on our activities and a broad range of regulatory requirements in order to effect \u201cprompt corrective action.\u201d The capital requirements applicable to us are in a process of continuous evaluation and revision in connection with actions of the Basel Committee and our regulators. We cannot predict the final form, or the effects, of these regulations on our business, but among the possible effects are requirements that we slow our rate of growth or obtain additional capital which could reduce our earnings or dilute our existing stockholders.\nWe are subject to claims and litigation in the ordinary course of our business, including claims that may not be covered by our insurers. Customers and other parties we engage with assert claims and take legal action against us on a regular basis and we regularly take legal action to collect unpaid borrower obligations, realize on collateral and assert our rights in commercial and other contexts. These actions frequently result in counter claims against us. Litigation arises in a variety of contexts, including lending activities, employment practices, commercial agreements, fiduciary responsibility related to our wealth management services, intellectual property rights and other general business matters.\nClaims and legal actions may result in significant legal costs to defend us or assert our rights and may result in reputational damage that adversely affects existing and future customer relationships. If claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us we may suffer significant financial liability or adverse effects upon our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Legal Proceedings below for additional disclosures regarding legal proceedings.\nWe purchase insurance coverage to mitigate a wide range of operating risks, including general liability, errors and omissions, professional liability, business interruption, cyber-crime, fraud and property loss, for events that may be materially detrimental to our Bank or customers. There is no assurance that our insurance will be adequate to protect us against material losses in excess of our coverage limits or that insurers will perform their obligations under our policies without attempting to limit or exclude coverage. We could be required to pursue legal actions against insurers to obtain payment of amounts we are owed, and there is no assurance that such actions, if pursued, would be successful.\nOther Risks Affecting Our Business\nOur business faces unpredictable economic and business conditions. Our business is directly impacted by general economic and business conditions in Texas, the United States and internationally. The credit quality of our loan portfolio necessarily reflects, among other things, the general economic conditions in the areas in which we and our customers conduct our respective businesses. Our continued financial success can be affected by other factors that are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022national, regional and local economic conditions;\n\u2022the value of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the currencies of other advanced and emerging market countries;\n\u2022the performance of both domestic and international equity and debt markets and valuation of securities traded on recognized domestic and international exchanges;\n\u2022general economic consequences of international conditions, such as weakness in European and South American sovereign debt and currencies and the U.K.'s referendum to exit from the European Union, and the impact of those conditions on the US and global economies;\n\u2022legislative and regulatory changes impacting our industry;\n\u2022the financial health of our customers and economic conditions affecting them and the value of our collateral, including effects from the COVID-19 pandemic and the continued price volatility of oil and gas and other commodities;\n\u2022the incidence of fraud, illegal payments, security breaches and other illegal acts among or impacting our Bank and our customers;\n\u2022structural changes in the markets for origination, sale and servicing of residential mortgages;\n\u2022changes in governmental economic and regulatory policies, including the extent and timing of intervention in credit markets by the Federal Reserve or withdrawal from that intervention, generally as well as changes attributable to presidential and congressional elections;\n\u2022changes in the availability of liquidity at a systemic level; and\n\u2022material inflation or deflation.\nSubstantial deterioration in any of the foregoing conditions can have a material adverse effect on our prospects and our results of operations and financial condition. There is no assurance that we will be able to return to our historical rate of growth or our profitability. Our Bank's customer base is primarily commercial in nature, and our Bank does not have a significant retail branch network or retail consumer deposit base. In periods of economic downturn, business and commercial deposits may be more volatile than traditional retail consumer deposits. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected to a greater degree by these uncertainties than competitors having a larger retail customer base.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting us and our customers, employees and third-party service providers, and the adverse impacts on our business, financial position, operations and prospects have been and are expected to continue to be significant. During 2020, as a result of the uncertainty, volatility and disruption in financial markets and in governmental, commercial and consumer activity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, business and consumer customers of the Bank experienced varying degrees of financial distress, which is expected to continue over coming months and may likely adversely affect their ability to timely pay interest and principal on their loans and the value of the collateral securing their obligations. During 2021, restrictive measures taken by governments, businesses and individuals eased and the U.S. economy began to improve. With the recent outbreak of the Omicron variant, we may experience additional uncertainty, volatility and disruption in financial markets and in governmental, commercial and consumer activity, which may lead to the recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for credit losses. Disruptions to our customers\u2019 businesses could also result in declines in, among other things, wealth management revenue. These new developments as a consequence of the pandemic may materially impact our business and the businesses of our customers and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results as the pandemic continues.\nEffective June 1, 2021, we returned to pre-pandemic business operations and brought 100% of our workforce back into the office. Our branch locations are currently open and operating during normal business hours. In order to protect the health of our customers and employees, we continue to take additional precautions within our branch locations, including enhanced cleaning procedures. We may take further such actions that we determine are in the best interest of our employees, customers and communities or as may be required by government order. These actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and similar actions by our vendors and business partners, have not materially impaired our ability to support our employees, conduct our business and serve our customers, but there is no assurance that these actions will be sufficient to successfully mitigate the risks presented by COVID-19 or that our ability to operate will not be materially affected going forward. For instance, our business operations may be disrupted if key personnel or significant portions of our employees are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, if any of our vendors or business partners become unable to continue to provide their products and services, which we rely upon to maintain our day-to-day operations, our ability to serve our customers could be impacted.\nCOVID-19 does not yet appear to be contained and the continued outbreak of new variants of COVID-19 could affect significantly more households and businesses. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is not possible to accurately predict the extent, severity or duration of these conditions or when normal economic and operating conditions will resume. For this reason, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic affects our business, operations and financial condition, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios and credit ratings, is highly uncertain and unpredictable and depends on, among other things, new information that may emerge concerning the scope, duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, actions taken by governmental authorities and other parties in response to the pandemic, the scale of distribution and public acceptance of any vaccines for COVID-19 and the effectiveness of such vaccines in stemming or stopping the spread of COVID-19. The adverse impact on the markets in which we operate and on our business, operations and financial condition is expected to remain elevated until the pandemic subsides.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including broker-dealers, commercial banks, investment banks and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us. There can be no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe impact of the Tax Act on us and our customers contributes to uncertainty and risk related to our customers' future demand for credit and our future results. The extent to which increased economic activity expected to result from the Tax Act has spurred additional economic activity or affected the extent of borrowing by our customers is unclear, although the continuation of the current economic expansion provides some evidence of a positive effect. At the same time, some of our customers may have elected to use their additional cash flow from lower taxes to fund their business, decreasing borrowing needs. The elimination of the federal income tax deductibility of business interest expense for a significant number of our customers effectively increases the cost of borrowing and makes equity or hybrid funding relatively more attractive. This could have a long-term negative impact on business customer borrowing. We realized a significant increase in our after-tax net income\navailable to stockholders attributable to the Tax Act beginning in 2018, but there is no guarantee that future years' results will have the same benefit. The continued compression of net interest margin at our bank and for competitor banks indicates that some or all of the expected benefit from the Tax Act has been lost as the banks and financial services companies we compete with have elected to lower interest rates and fees and we have responded in order to remain competitive. Additionally, the tax benefits could be repealed as a result of future political or regulatory actions, including as a result of changes proposed by the new U.S. presidential administration. There is no assurance that the current or anticipated benefits of the Tax Act will be realized in future periods.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities. A significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. There is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties, and that we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property's value by limiting our ability to use or sell it. Although we have policies and procedures requiring environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Future laws or regulations or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws and regulations may increase our exposure to environmental liability.\nSevere weather, earthquakes, other natural disasters, pandemics, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business. Severe weather, earthquakes, other natural disasters, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. Recent hurricanes caused extensive flooding and destruction along the coastal areas of Texas and in other areas in the US, including communities where we conduct business. Although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nClimate change has the potential to disrupt our business and adversely impact the operations and creditworthiness of our clients. Climate change has caused severe weather patterns and events that could disrupt operations at one or more of our locations, which may disrupt our ability to provide financial products and services to our clients. Climate change could also have a negative effect on the financial status and creditworthiness of our clients, which may decrease revenues and business activities from those clients, increase the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures to such clients, and decrease the value of our warrants and direct equity investments in such clients, if any.\nClimate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may result in operational changes and expenditures that could significantly impact our business. The current and anticipated effects of climate change are creating an increasing level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result, political and social attention to the issue of climate change has increased. In recent years, governments across the world have entered into international agreements to attempt to reduce global temperatures, in part by limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The United States government has rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement, the most recent international climate change accord, while the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies are likely to continue to propose and advance numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives seeking to mitigate the effects of climate change. These agreements and measures may result in the imposition of taxes and fees, the required purchase of emission credits, and the implementation of significant operational changes. In addition, the federal banking agencies under the current President\u2019s Administration may address climate-related issues in their agendas in various ways, including by increasing supervisory expectations with respect to banks\u2019 risk management practices, accounting for the effects of climate change in stress testing scenarios and systemic risk assessments, revising expectations for credit portfolio concentrations based on climate-related factors, and encouraging investment by banks in climate-related initiatives and lending to communities disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change. Each of the above-described initiatives, as well as other similar initiatives, may require us to expend significant capital and incur compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. Given the lack of empirical data on the credit and other financial risks posed by climate change, it is impossible to predict how climate change may impact our financial condition and operations; however, as a banking organization, the physical effects of climate change may present certain unique risks. For example, weather disasters, shifts in local climates and other disruptions related to climate change may adversely affect the value of real properties securing our loans, which could diminish the value of our loan portfolio. Such events may also cause reductions in regional and local economic activity that may have an adverse effect on our customers, which could limit our ability to raise and invest capital in these areas and communities, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nNegative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely affect our earnings. Reputational risk, or the risk to our earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in our business. Negative public opinion can result from the\nactual or perceived manner in which we conduct our business activities; our management of actual or potential conflicts of interest and ethical issues; and our protection of confidential client information. Our brand and reputation may also be harmed by actions taken by third parties that we contract with to provide services to the extent such parties fail to meet their contractual, legal and regulatory obligations or act in a manner that is harmful to our clients. If we fail to supervise these relationships effectively, we could also be subject to regulatory enforcement, including fines and penalties. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to keep and attract clients and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action. We take steps to minimize reputation risk in the way we conduct our business activities and deal with our clients, communities and vendors but our efforts may not be sufficient.\nRisks Relating to Our Securities\nOur stock price can be volatile. Stock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive. Our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:\n\u2022actual or anticipated variations in quarterly and annual results of our operations;\n\u2022changes in recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022changes in composition and perceptions of the investors who own our stock and other securities;\n\u2022changes in ratings from national rating agencies on publicly or privately-owned debt securities and deposits in our Bank;\n\u2022operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry, including regulatory actions against other financial institutions;\n\u2022actual or expected economic conditions that are perceived to affect our company such as changes in commodity prices, real estate values or interest rates;\n\u2022perceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors;\n\u2022new technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\u2022significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors;\n\u2022changes in government regulations and interpretation of those regulations, changes in our practices requested or required by regulators and changes in regulatory enforcement focus;\n\u2022impacts and disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends, could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.\nThe trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies. Although our common stock is traded on Nasdaq, the trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies. Given the lower trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause our stock price to fall. In addition, a substantial majority of common stock outstanding is held by institutional investors, and trading activity involving large positions may increase volatility of the stock price. Concentration of ownership by institutional investors and inability to execute trades covering large numbers of shares can increase volatility of stock price. Changes in general economic outlook or perspectives on our business or prospects by our institutional investors, whether factual or speculative, can have a major impact on our stock price.\nOur preferred stock is thinly traded. There is only a limited trading volume in our preferred stock due to the small size of the issue and its largely institutional holder base. Significant sales of our preferred stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause the price of the preferred stock to fall substantially.\nAn investment in our securities is not an insured deposit. Our common stock, preferred stock and indebtedness are not bank deposits and, therefore, are not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of securities of any company. As a result, if you acquire our common stock, preferred stock or indebtedness, you may lose some or all of your investment.\nThe holders of our indebtedness and preferred stock have rights that are senior to those of our common stockholders. As of December 31, 2021, we had $375.0 million outstanding in subordinated notes issued by our holding company and $113.4 million outstanding in junior subordinated notes that are held by statutory trusts which issued trust preferred securities to investors. At December 31, 2021, our Bank had $175.0 million in subordinated notes outstanding. Payments of the principal and interest on our trust preferred securities are conditionally guaranteed by us to the extent not paid by each trust, provided the trust has funds available for such obligations.\nOur subordinated notes and junior subordinated notes are senior to our shares of preferred stock and common stock in right of payment of dividends and other distributions. We must be current on interest and principal payments on our indebtedness before any dividends can be paid on our preferred stock or our common stock. In the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of our indebtedness must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to our preferred or common stockholders. If certain conditions are met, we have the right to defer interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) at any time or from time to time for a period not to exceed 20 consecutive quarters in a deferral period, during which time no dividends may be paid to holders of our preferred stock or common stock. Because our Bank\u2019s subordinated notes are obligations of the Bank, they would in liquidation of our Bank or sale of its assets receive payment before any amounts would be payable to holders of our common stock, preferred stock or subordinated notes.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had issued and outstanding 300,000 shares of our 5.75% fixed rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series B, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (the \u201cSeries B Preferred Stock\u201d) and 12 million depositary shares, each representing 1/40th interest in a share of the Series B preferred stock. Our preferred stock is senior to our shares of common stock in right of payment of dividends and other distributions. We must be current on dividends payable to holders of preferred stock before any dividends can be paid on our common stock. In the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of our preferred stock must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to our common stockholders.\nWe do not currently pay dividends on our common stock. We have not paid dividends on our common stock and we do not expect to do so for the foreseeable future. Our ability to pay dividends is limited by regulatory restrictions and the need to maintain sufficient consolidated capital. The ability of our Bank to pay dividends to us is limited by its obligation to maintain sufficient capital and by other regulatory restrictions as discussed above under the heading Supervision and Regulation - Restrictions on Payment of Dividends by Our Bank.\nFederal legislation and regulations impose restriction on the ownership of our common stock. The ability of a third party to acquire us is limited under applicable U.S. banking laws and regulations. The BHCA requires any bank holding company (as defined therein) to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve prior to acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of our outstanding Common Stock. Any \u201ccompany\u201d (as defined in the BHCA) other than a bank holding company would be required to obtain Federal Reserve approval before acquiring \u201ccontrol\u201d of us. \u201cControl\u201d generally means (i) the ownership or control of 25% or more of a class of voting securities, (ii) the ability to elect a majority of the directors or (iii) the ability otherwise to exercise a controlling influence over management and policies. A holder of 25% or more of our outstanding Common Stock, other than an individual, is subject to regulation and supervision as a bank holding company under the BHCA. In addition, under the CIBC Act and the Federal Reserve\u2019s regulations thereunder, any person, either individually or acting through or in concert with one or more persons, is required to provide notice to the Federal Reserve prior to acquiring, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of our outstanding common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law may make it more difficult for you to receive a change in control premium. Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest more difficult, even if such events were perceived by many of our stockholders as beneficial to their interests. These provisions include advance notice for nominations of directors and stockholders' proposals, and authority to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors. In addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which, in general, prevents an interested stockholder, defined generally as a person owning 15% or more of a corporation's outstanding voting stock, from engaging in a business combination with our company for three years following the date that person became an interested stockholder unless certain specified conditions are satisfied.\nOur Bank is subject to regulatory and contractual limitation on the payment of its subordinated notes. Under the FDIA, \u201ccritically undercapitalized\u201d banks may not, beginning 60 days after becoming critically undercapitalized, make any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt (subject to certain limited exceptions). In addition, under Section 18(i) of the FDIA, our Bank is required to obtain the advance consent of the FDIC to retire any part of its subordinated notes. Under the FDIA, a bank may not pay interest on its subordinated notes if such interest is required to be paid only out of net profits, or distribute any of its capital assets, while it remains in default on any assessment due to the FDIC.\nOur Bank\u2019s subordinated indebtedness is unsecured and subordinate and junior in right of payment to the Bank\u2019s obligations to its depositors, its obligations under banker\u2019s acceptances and letters of credit, its obligations to any FRB, certain obligations to\nthe FDIC, and its obligations to its other creditors, whether now outstanding or hereafter incurred, except any obligations which expressly rank on a parity with or junior to the subordinated notes.", "PERMNO": 89826, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "TCBI"}
