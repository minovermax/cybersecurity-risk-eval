business. The following discussion highlights the risks that management believes are material for our Company, but do not necessarily include all the risks that we may face. You should carefully consider the risk factors and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\"Report\") in evaluating an investment in our common stock.\nRisks relating to our Business and Business Strategy\nWe face risks and uncertainties related to our proposed Merger with ACBI.\nThe Company and ACBI operate and, until the completion of the Merger, will continue to operate independently. There can be no assurances that the businesses of the Company and ACBI can be integrated successfully. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key Company or ACBI employees, the loss of customers, the disruption of either company\u2019s ongoing businesses, inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. The success of the Merger will depend on, among other things, the ability of the Company and ACBI to combine their businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes cost savings. However, if the combined company is not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nFailure to complete our proposed Merger with ACBI could negatively impact our business, financial results and stock price.\nIf our proposed merger with ACBI is not completed for any reason, our ongoing business may be adversely affected, and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Merger, we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nWe will be required to pay certain costs relating to the merger, whether or not the Merger is completed, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees;\n\u2022\nThe ACBI Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of both the Company\u2019s and ACBI\u2019s business before completion of the Merger, which may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies; and\n\u2022\nMatters relating to the Merger are requiring substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which could have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us, as an independent company.\nIn addition, if the Merger is not completed, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our customers and employees. For example, we may be impacted adversely by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Merger. The market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. We also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Merger or to proceedings commenced against us to perform our obligations under the ACBI Merger Agreement. If the Merger is not completed, we cannot assure you that the risks described above will not materialize and will not materially affect our business, financial results and stock price.\nThe Company may not be able to integrate successfully the companies or to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger.\nAssuming the Merger is approved, the successful integration of systems and operations will depend substantially on the Company\u2019s ability to consolidate successfully corporate cultures, management teams, operations, systems, processes and procedures and to eliminate redundancies and costs. While we have substantial experience in successfully integrating institutions we have acquired, we may encounter difficulties during integration, such as:\n\u2022 the loss of key employees and clients;\n\u2022 the disruption of operations and businesses;\n\u2022 inability to maintain and increase competitive presence in the Atlanta market;\n\u2022 loan, deposit, and revenue attrition;\n\u2022 inconsistencies in standards, control procedures and policies;\n\u2022 unexpected issues with costs, operations, personnel, technology; and\n\u2022 problems with the assimilation of new operations, sites or personnel.\nIntegration activities could divert resources from regular operations. In addition, general market and economic conditions or governmental actions affecting the financial industry generally may inhibit the Company\u2019s successful integration of these entities.\nThe Company and ACBI entered into the ACBI Merger Agreement with the expectation that the Merger would result in various synergies including, among other things, benefits relating to enhanced revenues, a strengthened and expanded market position for the combined organization in the Atlanta market, technology efficiencies, cost savings and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the Merger is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the Company integrates the institutions in an efficient and effective manner, as well as general competitive factors in the marketplace. Failure to achieve or delays in achieving these anticipated benefits could result in a share price reduction as well as increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy and could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects.\nThe Company will continue to incur substantial expenses related to the ACBI Merger and the integration.\nThe Company must integrate ACBI\u2019s processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems. In addition, the Merger may increase the Company\u2019s compliance and legal risks, including increased litigation or regulatory actions such as fines or restrictions related to the business practices or operations of the combined business. While the Company has assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred, many factors beyond the Company\u2019s control could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses. Moreover, many of the expenses that the Company will incur are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the expected savings from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale. The amount and timing of future charges to earnings as a result of merger or integration expenses are uncertain.\nThe Company will continue to incur substantial expenses related to the conversion and integration of the CenterState Merger.\nWhile the Company completed the conversion of systems in connection with the CenterState Merger in May 2021, we continue to address clean up integration tasks which could delay the realization of merger synergies and increase the Company\u2019s compliance and operational costs. While the Company has assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred, many factors beyond the Company\u2019s control could affect the total amount or the timing of any remaining integration expenses. Moreover, many of the expenses that the Company will incur are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the expected savings from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale. The amount and timing of future charges to earnings as a result of merger or integration expenses are uncertain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the ultimate impacts of the pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments and other factors that are highly uncertain and will be impacted by the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic.\nAlthough the global economy has begun to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic as many health and safety restrictions have been lifted and vaccine distribution has increased, certain adverse consequences of the pandemic continue to impact the macroeconomic environment and may persist for some time, including labor shortages and disruptions of global supply chains. These consequences of the pandemic have resulted in significant adverse effects for many different types of businesses nationwide and in the regions in which we operate, including, among others, those in the travel, hospitality and food and beverage industries.\nThe global supply chain has been drastically disrupted during the pandemic and remains challenged as it adapts and responds. In part as a result, inflation has exceeded the Federal Reserve\u2019s two percent (2%) annual target, and there is a risk that inflation may become higher or persist for longer periods of time and not decrease even as supply chain issues are resolved. Additional impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business could be widespread and material, and may include, or exacerbate, among other consequences, the following:\n\u2022 employees contracting COVID-19;\n\u2022 reductions in our operating effectiveness as our employees work from home;\n\u2022 work stoppages, forced quarantines, or other interruptions of our business;\n\u2022 employee fatigue as a result of the length of the pandemic response;\n\u2022 unavailability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business activities;\n\u2022 effects on key employees, including operational management personnel and those charged with preparing, monitoring and evaluating our financial reporting and internal controls;\n\u2022 increased cybersecurity risks as 41% of the workforce works from home;\n\u2022 sustained closures of our branch lobbies or the offices of our customers;\n\u2022 declines in demand for loans and other banking services and products;\n\u2022 reduced consumer spending due to both job losses and other effects attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022 volatile performance of our investment securities portfolio;\n\u2022 decline in the credit quality of our loan portfolio, owing to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the markets we serve, leading to a need to increase our allowance for credit losses;\n\u2022 declines in value of collateral for loans, including real estate collateral;\n\u2022 declines in the net worth and liquidity of borrowers and loan guarantors, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us;\n\u2022 a reduction in fee income from reduced demand for loans and deposit services,\n\u2022 a reduction of net interest margin from reductions in interest rates and the yield curve;\n\u2022 an increase in expenses; and\n\u2022 declines in demand resulting from businesses being deemed to be \u201cnon-essential\u201d by governments in the markets we serve, and from \u201cnon-essential\u201d and \u201cessential\u201d businesses suffering adverse effects from reduced levels of economic activity in our markets.\nA resurgence of the pandemic or a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines could worsen these impacts and also affect the Company\u2019s capital and liquidity position, cause an outflow of deposits, cause significant property damage, in case of civil unrest or vandalism, influence the recognition of credit losses on loans and securities and increase the allowance for credit losses, result in additional lost revenue, cause additional increases in expenses, result in goodwill impairment charges, result in the impairment of other financial and nonfinancial assets, and increase the Company\u2019s cost of capital. These factors, together or in combination with other events or occurrences that may not yet be known or anticipated, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic resulted in more volatile stock prices for many companies, including our own, as well as the trading prices for many other securities during 2021. The further spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as ongoing or new governmental, regulatory and private sector responses to the pandemic, may not be successful or may result in increased pressure on the banking sector other economic activity generally and in the areas in which we operate. While loan demand has increased during the second half of 2021, any new or increased spread of the COVID-19 virus or increase in interest rates to address inflationary pressures could result in declines in demand for our banking products and services and could negatively impact, among other things, our liquidity, regulatory capital, goodwill and our growth strategy. In addition, while net interest margin has been, and is likely to continue to be, affected by the very low interest rate environment any increase in rates may increase the margin, allowing us to earn more on our assets. The Company participated in the SBA\u2019s PPP as an eligible lender with the benefit of a government guaranty of loans to small business clients, many of whom may face difficulties even after being granted such a loan. The Company faces increased risks, in terms of credit, fraud risk and litigation, in light of its participation in these programs. Any one or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are taking precautions to protect the safety and well-being of our employees and customers; however, the Company can make no assurance that the steps being taken will be adequate or deemed to be appropriate, nor can we predict the level of disruption which will occur to our employees\u2019 ability to provide customer support and service. If we are unable to recover from a business disruption on a timely basis, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions, which could further adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe implementation of new lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risk.\nWe continuously evaluate our service offerings and may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business in new sales channels such as online and mobile banking in the future. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, we undergo a new product process to assess the risks of and resources needed for the initiative, and invest significant time and resources to build internal controls, policies and procedures to mitigate those risks, including hiring experienced management to oversee the implementation of the initiative. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services and/or new sales channels may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business and/or a new product or service and/or sales channels. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could require the establishment of new key and other controls and have a significant impact on our existing system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business and/or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe adoption of the Current Expected Credit Loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) standard, the merger activity and the COVID-19 pandemic may result in increased volatility and further increases in our allowance for credit losses (\u201cACL\u201d).\nThe measure of our ACL is dependent on the adoption and interpretation of applicable accounting standards, as well as external events, including the CenterState and ACBI mergers and the COVID-19 pandemic. We adopted the\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL standard, in the first quarter of 2020. Under the CECL model, we are required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held to maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount and certain Management judgments over the life of the loan. This initial measurement took place as of January 1, 2020 at the time of our adoption of CECL.\nThe CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our ACL, as compared to the \u201cincurred loss\u201d standard that we previously applied in determining our ACL. The CECL model requires us to estimate the lifetime \u201cexpected credit loss\u201d with respect to loans and other applicable financial assets, which may change more rapidly than the level of \u201cincurred losses\u201d that would have been used to determine our allowance for loan losses under the prior incurred loss standard. While the Company has reduced the ACL over the past several quarters, the potentially material effects of the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic on lifetime expected credit loss, and the challenges associated with estimating lifetime credit losses in view of the uncertain ultimate impacts of the pandemic, has resulted and may continue to result in increased volatility and significant additions to our ACL in the future, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company\u2019s estimate of its ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, the Company's process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach a different reasonable conclusion. Further, if management\u2019s assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect and the allowance for credit losses is inadequate to absorb losses going forward, or if bank regulatory authorities require us to increase the allowance for credit losses as a part of their examination process, our earnings and capital could be significantly and adversely affected.\nTechnological changes, including online and mobile banking, have the potential of disrupting our business model, and we may have fewer resources than many competitors to invest in technological improvements.\nThe financial services industry continues to undergo rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services, including mobile and online banking services. Changes in customer behaviors have increased the need to offer these options to our customers. Further, the occurrence and continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated technological change as our employees and the customers and communities to which we provide products and services experienced quarantines, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in business activity and financial transactions, and supply chain interruptions.\nIn addition to serving clients better, investments in, and the effective use of, technology may increase efficiency and may enable financial institutions to reduce costs. These investments may not be sufficient or provide the anticipated benefits or desired return. We can make no assurance that investments will be sufficient to retain existing customers or attract new customers in the future.\nOur future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to invest in and use technology to provide products and services that provide convenience to customers and to create additional efficiencies in operations. One of our strategic goals is to continue to focus on technological change and digital transformation of our product and service channels, which will impact how we deliver our products and services in the future as well as make our internal processes more efficient. We will need to make significant additional capital investments in technology in the future to achieve this strategic goal, and we may not be able to implement effectively new technology-driven products and services in a timely manner in response to changes in customer behaviors, thus adversely impacting our operations. Many competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than the Company.\nOur business strategy includes continued growth, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively.\nWe intend to continue pursuing a growth strategy for our business. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in significant growth stages of development. Our ability to continue to grow successfully will depend on a variety of factors, including economic conditions in the markets in which we operate as well as in the U.S. and globally, continued availability of desirable business opportunities, the competitive responses from other financial and non-financial institution competitors in our market areas, our ability to continue to implement and improve our operational, credit, financial, management and other risks\ncontrols and processes and our reporting systems and procedures to manage a growing number of client relationships, and our ability to integrate our acquisitions and develop consistent policies throughout our various businesses. While we believe we have the management and other resources and internal systems in place to successfully manage our future growth, and we are expanding those resources and systems as we continue to grow, there can be no assurance growth opportunities will be available or growth will be successfully managed. In addition, if we are unable to manage future expansion in our operations, we may experience compliance and operational problems, have to slow the pace of growth, or have to incur additional expenditures beyond current projections to support such growth, any of which could adversely affect our business. Particularly in light of prevailing economic and competitive conditions, we cannot assure you we will be able to expand our market presence in our existing markets or successfully enter new markets or that any such expansion will not adversely affect our results of operations. Failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, future prospects, financial condition or results of operations, and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Also, if our growth occurs more slowly than anticipated or declines, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and events that negatively impact the real estate market could hurt our business.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolios are secured by real estate. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 80.4% of such loans had real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. There can be no assurance that our local markets will not experience another economic decline. A decline in local economic conditions may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of other financial institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are more geographically diverse. Deterioration in the real estate market could cause us to adjust our opinion of the level of credit quality in our loan portfolio. Such a determination may lead to an additional increase in our allowance for credit losses, which could also adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur loan portfolio includes commercial and commercial real estate loans that may have higher risks.\nOur commercial and commercial real estate loans at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $18.2 billion and $18.8 billion, respectively, or 76%, of total loans. Commercial and commercial real estate loans generally carry larger loan balances and can involve a greater degree of financial and credit risk than other loans. The increased financial and credit risk associated with these types of loans are a result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the size of loan balances, the effects of general economic conditions on income-producing properties and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans.\nAs a result, banking regulators give greater scrutiny to lenders with a high concentration of commercial real estate loans in their portfolios, and such lenders are expected to implement stricter underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies and portfolio stress testing, as well as maintain higher capital levels and loss allowances. The Guidance states that the following metrics may indicate a concentration of commercial real estate loans, but that these metrics are neither limits nor a safe harbor:\n1) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land equal 100% or more of total risk based capital (as of December 31, 2021, our bank ratio was 55%); and\n2) total reported loans secured by multifamily and non-farm nonresidential properties and loans for construction, land development, and other land equal 300% or more of total risk-based capital (as of December 31, 2021, our bank ratio was 239%).\nRegulators may require banks to maintain elevated levels of capital or liquidity due to commercial real estate loan concentrations, and could do so, especially if there is a downturn in our local real estate markets. See Part I Item 1. \u201cSupervision and Regulation - Lending Standards and Guidance\u201d for further details on the Guidance.\nFurthermore, the repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate or commercial project. If the cash flows from the project are reduced, a borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. This cash flow shortage may result in the failure to make loan payments. In such cases, we may be compelled to modify the terms of the loan. In addition, the nature of these loans is such that they are generally less predictable and more difficult to evaluate and monitor. As a result, repayment of these\nloans may, to a greater extent than residential loans, be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or economy.\nWe may not be able to adequately anticipate and respond to changes in market interest rates.\nWe may be unable to anticipate changes in market interest rates, which are affected by many factors beyond our control including but not limited to inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, monetary policy, and other changes that affect financial markets both domestic and foreign. Our net interest income is affected not only by the level and direction of interest rates, but also by the shape of the yield curve and relationships between interest sensitive instruments and key driver rates, as well as balance sheet growth, customer loan and deposit preferences, and the timing of changes in these variables. In the event rates increase, our interest costs on liabilities may increase more rapidly than our income on interest earning assets, thus a deterioration of net interest margins. As such, fluctuations in interest rates could have significant adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur net interest income may decline based on the interest rate environment.\nWe depend on our net interest income to drive our profitability. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we receive from interest earning assets (e.g., loans and investment securities) and the interest expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities (e.g., deposits and borrowings). We are exposed to changes in general interest rate levels and other economic factors beyond our control, and an increase in our cost of funds could negatively impact our net interest income. Net interest income will decline in a particular period if:\n\u2022 in a declining interest rate environment, more interest earning assets than interest bearing liabilities re price or mature, or\n\u2022 in a rising interest rate environment, more interest-bearing liabilities than interest earning assets re price or mature, or\n\u2022 for acquired loans, expected total cash flows decline as our loan balances decline.\nOur net interest income may decline based on our exposure to a difference in short term and long term interest rates. If the difference between the interest rates shrinks or disappears, the difference between rates paid on deposits and received on loans could narrow significantly resulting in a decrease in net interest income. In addition to these factors, if market interest rates rise rapidly, interest rate adjustment caps may limit increases in the interest rates on adjustable rate loans, thus reducing our net interest income. In addition, certain adjustable rate loans re price based on lagging interest rate indices. This lagging effect may also negatively impact our net interest income when general interest rates continue to rise periodically.\nWhile interest rates remain low, the Federal Reserve is expected to begin slowly raising interest rates during 2022. We cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary policies or the precise effects that they may have on our activities and financial results.\nIn addition, our net interest income may be adversely affected by inflationary pressures and global supply chain challenges. In part because the global supply chain has been drastically disrupted during the pandemic and remains challenged as it adapts and responds, inflation has exceeded the Federal Reserve\u2019s two percent (2%) annual target. There is a risk that inflation may become higher or persist for longer periods of time and not decrease even as supply chain issues are resolved. While loan demand has increased during the second half of 2021, any increase in interest rates to address inflationary pressures could result in declines in demand for our banking products and services and could negatively impact, among other things, our liquidity, regulatory capital, goodwill and our growth strategy.\nIf we fail to effectively manage credit risk and interest rate risk, our business and financial condition will suffer.\nWe must effectively manage credit risk. There are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan may be repaid, risks relating to proper loan underwriting and guidelines, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions, risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers and risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral. There is no assurance that our credit risk monitoring and loan approval procedures are or will be adequate or will reduce the inherent risks associated with lending. Our credit administration personnel, policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic\nor any other conditions affecting customers and the quality of our loan portfolio. Any failure to manage such credit risks may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe must also effectively manage interest rate risk. Because mortgage loans typically have much longer maturities than deposits or other types of funding, rising interest rates can raise the cost of funding relative to the value of the mortgage loan. We manage this risk in part by holding adjustable rate mortgages in portfolios and through other means. Conversely, the value of our mortgage servicing assets may fall when interest rates fall, as borrowers refinance into lower rate loans. Given current rates, material reductions in rates may not be probable, but as rates rise, this risk increases. There can be no assurance that we will successfully manage the lending and servicing businesses through all future interest rate environments.\nThe results of our most recent stress tests may not accurately predict the impact on our financial condition if the economy were to deteriorate.\nWe perform capital stress testing on an annual basis using the stress testing assumptions provided by the regulators for the CCAR stress tests. We perform liquidity stress testing and credit stress testing on a quarterly basis. Under the capital stress test, we estimate our loan losses (loan charge-offs), resources available to absorb those losses and any necessary additions to capital that would be required under the \u201cmore adverse\u201d stress test scenario. The results of these stress tests involve many assumptions about the economy and future loan losses and default rates, and may not accurately reflect the impact on our financial condition if the economy were to deteriorate. Any deterioration of the economy could result in credit losses significantly higher, with a corresponding impact on our financial condition and capital, than those predicted by our internal stress test.\nOur size and continued pace of growth may require us to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. Our ability to raise capital, if needed, in the future to meet capital requirements or otherwise will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, there is no assurance as to our ability to raise additional capital if needed on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired.\nOur processes for managing risk may not be effective in mitigating risk or losses to us.\nThe objectives of our risk management processes are to mitigate risk and loss to our organization. We have established an enterprise risk framework and program that are intended to identify, measure, monitor report and analyze the types of risks to which we are subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, operational risk, cybersecurity risk, corporate governance and legal risk, compliance risk, and reputational risk, among others. However, this framework will evolve as we expect to become subject to heightened expectations from the OCC as we grow above $50 billion in assets. In addition, as with any risk management process, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. The ongoing developments in the financial institutions industry continue to highlight both the importance and some of the limitations of managing unanticipated risks. If our risk management processes prove ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.\nThe continued buildout of our mortgage line of business may subject us to additional risk.\nWe continued to build our mortgage line of business in 2021, and in so doing, invested significant time and resources to continue to expand the mortgage business within our market areas. Our price and profitability targets for this business may not prove feasible, due to unexpected delays in the continued implementation of these strategies, as well as external factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, changing tax rates and strategies, interest rates, economic conditions, the continuance of the COVID-19 pandemic, and shifting market preferences, which could impact the profitability of these lines of business and have a material adverse effect on our businesses, and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur recent results may not be indicative of our future results.\nWe may not be able to sustain our historical rate of growth or may not even be able to grow our business at all. In addition, our recent growth may distort some of our historical financial ratios and statistics. Various factors, such as economic conditions, regulatory and legislative considerations and competition, may also impede or prohibit our ability to expand our market presence. If we experience a significant decrease in our historical rate of growth, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected due to a high percentage of our operating costs being fixed expenses.\nWe are subject to environmental risks in our lending activities.\nBecause a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property, we may foreclose upon and take title to such property in the ordinary course of business. If hazardous substances were discovered on any of these properties, we may be liable to governmental agencies or third parties for the full costs of remediation, as well as for related personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws might require us to incur substantial expenses, materially reduce the property\u2019s value, or limit our ability to use or sell the property. Although our management has policies requiring environmental reviews before loans secured by real property are made and before foreclosure is commenced, it is still possible that environmental risks might not be detected and that the associated costs might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Many environmental laws impose liability regardless of whether the Company knew of, or were responsible for, the contamination. In addition, banks credit and underwriting policies that result in funding fossil fuel projects may impact climate change and lead to increased green house gas emissions. Banks have very limited control over the actions of their clients, and while banks can monitor client emissions and environmental profiles, information currently available is insufficient to assess both climate risk and the financial risk inherent in making lending decisions. Accordingly, the Bank may be unable to assess how our lending decisions affect both our risk profile and our profitability as well as our client\u2019s efforts to address climate change.\nWhile we use appraisals in deciding whether to make a loan that is secured by real estate, they do not ensure the value of the real property collateral.\nIn deciding whether to make a loan secured by real property, we generally require an appraisal. However, an appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made. If the appraised amount does not reflect the amount that may be obtained upon any sale or foreclosure of the property, we may not realize an amount equal to the indebtedness secured by the property.\nWe are subject to losses due to errors, omissions or fraudulent behavior by our employees, clients, counterparties or other third parties.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of fraud by third parties, customers and employees, clerical recordkeeping errors and transactional errors. Like the financial services industry overall, we have seen an increase in fraudulent attempts on debit cards, and accounts during 2021 in part due to the material increase in online, including \u201ccard not present\u201d transactions during the COVID-19 pandemic. While our procedures are designed to follow customary, industry-specific security precautions and while we provide employees with ongoing training, table-top exercises and regular communications and guidance to combat fraud, our efforts might not be successful in mitigating or reducing fraudulent attempts resulting in financial losses, increased litigation risk and reputational harm.\nOur business also is dependent on our employees as well as third-party service providers to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions. We could be materially and adversely affected if employees, clients, counterparties or other third parties caused an operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error, fraudulent manipulation or purposeful damage to any of our operations or systems.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in deciding whether to extend credit to clients, we may assume that a customer\u2019s audited financial statements conform to GAAP and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. Our earnings are significantly affected by our ability to properly originate, underwrite and service loans. Our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent we incorrectly assess the creditworthiness of our borrowers, fail to detect or respond to deterioration in asset quality in a timely manner, or\nrely on financial statements that do not comply with GAAP or are materially misleading.\nWe are subject to environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) risks that could adversely affect our reputation, the trading price of our common stock and/or our business, operations, and earnings.\nGovernments, investors, customers, and the general public are increasingly focused on ESG practices and disclosures. For us and others in the financial services industry, this focus extends to the practices and disclosures of the customers, counterparties, and service providers with whom we choose to do business. In addition, certain organizations that provide corporate governance and other corporate risk information to investors and shareholders have developed scores and ratings to evaluate companies based upon ESG metrics. Currently, there are no universal standards for such scores or ratings, but the importance of ESG evaluations is becoming more broadly accepted by investors and shareholders. Views about ESG are diverse, dynamic, and rapidly changing, and if we were to fail to maintain appropriate ESG practices and disclosures or be subject to a low ESG score or rating, we could face potential negative ESG-related publicity in traditional and social media, including based on the identity of those we choose to do business with and the public\u2019s view of those customers. If we or our relationships with customers, vendors and suppliers were to become the subject of such negative publicity or low ESG scores or ratings, our ability to attract and retain customers and employees may be negatively impacted and our stock price may also be impacted.\nAdditionally, investors have begun to consider how corporations are addressing ESG matters when making investment decisions. For example, certain investors are beginning to incorporate the business risks of climate change and the adequacy of companies\u2019 responses to climate change and other ESG matters as part of their investment theses. Any such negative publicity regarding ESG, low ESG scores or ratings, or shifts in investing priorities may result in adverse effects on the trading price of our common stock and/or our business, operations and earnings if investors, shareholders or other stakeholders determine that we have not adequately considered or addressed ESG matters.\nA lack of liquidity could affect our operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our funding sources include core deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, non-core deposits, and short- and long-term debt. Other sources of liquidity are available to us should they be needed, including our ability to acquire additional non-core deposits, the issuance and sale of debt securities, a secured line of credit we have with U.S. Bank, and the issuance and sale of preferred or common securities in public or private transactions. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Our ability to borrow could be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as further disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the continued deterioration in credit markets.\nOur business could suffer if we fail to maintain our culture and attract and retain skilled people.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain competent, experienced people. Our strategic goals in particular require that we be able to attract qualified and experienced retail and commercial lending officers, mortgage loan officers, and SBA lenders in our existing markets as well as those markets in which we may want to expand who share our relationship banking philosophy and have those customer relationships that will allow us to grow successfully. We also need to attract and retain qualified and experienced technology, risk and back-office personnel to operate our business. Many of our competitors are pursuing the same relationship banking strategy in our markets and are looking to hire and retain qualified technology, risk and back-office personnel, which increases the competition to identify, hire and retain talented employees.\nThe CenterState Merger and the integration of the Company\u2019s and CenterState\u2019s operations and employees into one bank creates an additional risk to the Company\u2019s culture. If we fail to consider and account for corporate cultural differences across the two companies, we will face increased difficulty in creating a cohesive culture upon integration. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has made this cultural integration more challenging as many employees continue working from remote environments, which has drastically decreased the opportunities for employees to gather and nurture relationships with colleagues in different departments, locations or legacy institutions.\nWe have focused, and will continue to focus, our strategic attention on our employees and our corporate culture, including enhancing our employee orientation, ongoing general and management training, mentoring and employee work environment as well as diversity and employee advancement. Our failure to maintain our culture and attractive working environment, through competitive compensation packages that reward initiative, as well as mentoring, training, and advancement opportunities in order to successfully compete for experienced, qualified employees may have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our financial goals and thus adversely affect our future results of operations.\nIf we are unable to offer our key management personnel long term incentive compensation, including restricted stock units and performance share units, as part of their total compensation package, we may have difficulty retaining such personnel, which would adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\nWe have a management team that has substantial experience in banking and financial services in the markets we serve. We rely on our management team to achieve and sustain our profitability. Our future success and profitability are substantially dependent upon this management and banking abilities of our senior executives. Although we currently have employment agreements in place with our executive management team and our regional presidents, we cannot guarantee that our executives will remain with us. Changes in key personnel and their responsibilities may be disruptive to our business because of their skills, customer relationship and/or the potential difficulty of promptly replacing them with successors.\nWe have historically granted equity awards under an equity compensation plan, which includes granting performance share units and restricted stock awards or restricted stock units, to key management personnel as part of a competitive compensation package. Our ability to grant these awards has been vital to attracting, retaining and aligning shareholder interest with a talented management team in a highly competitive marketplace.\nShareholder advisory groups have implemented guidelines and issued voting recommendations related to how much equity companies should be able to grant to employees. The factors used to formulate these guidelines and voting recommendations include the volatility of a company\u2019s share price and are influenced by broader macroeconomic conditions that can change year to year. The variables used by shareholder advisory groups to formulate equity plan recommendations may limit our ability to adopt new equity plans in the future. In addition, the federal banking regulators have issued guidance on executive compensation and have also, along with the SEC, proposed rules that would prohibit certain incentive compensation arrangements. We do not believe that the guidance or proposal will impact our current compensation arrangements.\nIf we are limited in our ability to grant equity compensation awards, we would need to explore offering other compelling alternatives to supplement our compensation, including long-term cash compensation plans or significantly increased short-term cash compensation, in order to continue to attract and retain key management personnel. If we used these alternatives to long-term equity awards, our compensation costs could increase and our financial performance could be adversely affected. If we are unable to offer key management personnel long-term incentive compensation, including stock options, restricted stock or restricted stock units, or performance share units, as part of their total compensation package, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining such personnel, which would adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\nWe rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to attract, retain, develop and motivate our human capital in the form of well-qualified employees, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe believe our success has depended, continues to and in the future will, depend, on the efforts and talents of our management team and our highly skilled employees and workers. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. The loss of any of our senior management or key employees could materially and adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts that they have undertaken and to execute our business plan, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements. Despite our current efforts, we cannot ensure that we will be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or developing, retaining and motivating our employees, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird parties provide key components of our business infrastructure, such as our loan and deposit documents, underwriting software, compliance software, product and service offerings, core processing, and internet connections and network access. Any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle currently or higher volumes of use could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our clients and otherwise to conduct business. Technological or financial difficulties of one or our third-party service providers or their sub-contractors could adversely affect our business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. In addition, one or more of our third-party service providers may become subject to cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss of destruction of our or our client\u2019s confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt our or our clients\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 business operations. While we have processes in place to monitor our third-party service providers\u2019 data and information security safeguards, we do not control such service providers\u2019 day to day operations and a successful attack or security breach at one or more of such third-party service providers is not within our control. The occurrence of any such breaches or failures could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny, civil litigation, and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, in some instances we may be responsible for the failure of such third parties to comply with government regulations, and our business recovery plan may not be adequate and may not prevent significant interruptions of our operations or substantial losses. We may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third-party failures and our insurance coverage may not be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures, third-party breaches, or other disruptions. Failures in our business structure or in the structure of one or more of our third-party service providers could interrupt the operations or increase the cost of doing business.\nA failure and/or breach of our operational or securities systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt our business, result in a disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.\nThe potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our business and, as a result of our interactions with, and reliance on, third parties, is not limited to our own internal operational functions. We depend on our ability to process, record and monitor a large number of client transactions on a continuous basis. As client, public and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, we must continue to safeguard and monitor our operational systems and infrastructure for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting, data processing, or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. Although we have information and data security, business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and clients.\nWe rely on our employees and third parties in our day-to-day and ongoing operations, who may, as a result of human error, misconduct, malfeasance or failure, or breach of our or of third-party systems or infrastructure, expose us to risk. For example, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely. In addition, our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is more limited than with respect to our own systems. Our financial, accounting, data processing, backup or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our ability to control, which could adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide services. Such events may include: sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical, telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and floods; disease pandemics; and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including wars and terrorist acts. In addition, we may need to take our systems offline if they become infected with malware or a computer virus or as a result of another form of cyber-attack. In the event that backup systems are utilized, they may not process data as quickly as our primary systems and some data might not have been saved to backup systems, potentially resulting in a temporary or permanent loss of such data. We frequently update our systems to support our operations and growth and to remain compliant with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. This updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones, including business interruptions. Implementation and testing of controls related to our computer systems, security monitoring and retaining\nand training personnel required to operate our systems also entail significant costs. Operational risk exposures could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause reputational harm. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption.\nAny failure or interruption in the operation of our communications and information systems could impair or prevent the effective operation of our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, lending or other functions. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of a failure or interruption in the operation of our information systems, there could be no assurance that any such failures or interruptions will not occur or, if they do, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures or interruptions impacting our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny, civil litigation, and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face security risks, including denial of service attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks targeting our colleagues and customers, malware intrusion or data corruption attempts, and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect our business or reputation, and create significant legal and financial exposure.\nOur computer systems and network infrastructure and those of third parties, on which we are highly dependent, are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities or identity theft. Our business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties. In addition, to access our network, products and services, our customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks.\nWe, our customers, regulators and other third parties, including other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing, have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber-attacks. These cyber-attacks include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, ransomware, improper access by employees or vendors, attacks on personal email of employees, ransom demands to not expose security vulnerabilities in our systems or the systems of third parties or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information of ours, our employees, our customers or of third parties, damage our systems or otherwise materially disrupt our or our customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 network access or business operations. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and implement controls, processes, policies and other protective measures, we may not be able to anticipate all security breaches, nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss.\nCybersecurity risks for banking organizations have significantly increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions. For example, cybersecurity risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications. In addition, cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years in part due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations, hostile foreign governments, disgruntled employees or vendors, activists and other external parties, including those involved in corporate espionage. Even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise. Targeted social engineering attacks and \"spear phishing\" attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent. In such an attack, an attacker will attempt to fraudulently induce colleagues, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to its data or that of its clients. Persistent attackers may succeed in penetrating defenses given enough resources, time, and motive. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and may not be recognized until well after a breach has occurred. The risk of a security breach caused by a cyber-attack at a vendor or by unauthorized vendor access has also increased in recent years. Additionally, the existence of cyber-attacks or security breaches at third-party vendors with access to our data may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner.\nWe also face indirect technology, cybersecurity and operational risks relating to the customers, clients and other third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities, including, for example, financial counterparties, regulators and providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power. As a result of increasing consolidation, interdependence and complexity of financial entities and technology systems, a technology failure, cyber-attack or other information or security breach that significantly degrades, deletes or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including us. This consolidation, interconnectivity and complexity increases the risk of operational failure, on both individual and industry-wide bases, as disparate systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis. Any third-party technology failure, cyber-attack or other information or security breach, termination or constraint could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our business. In addition, we, our employees and our customers, are increasingly transitioning our and their computing infrastructure to cloud-based computing, storage, data processing, networking and other services, which may increase these security risks.\nCyber-attacks or other information or security breaches, whether directed at us or third parties, may result in a material loss or have material consequences. Furthermore, the public perception that a cyber-attack on our systems has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct, may damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business. Hacking of personal information and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational harm. A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us serious negative consequences, including our loss of customers and business opportunities, significant business disruption to our operations and business, misappropriation or destruction of our confidential information and/or that of our customers, or damage to our or our customers\u2019 and/or third parties\u2019 computers or systems, and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in our security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, additional compliance costs, and could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nAlthough to date we have not experienced any material losses related to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future.\nWe may face risks with respect to future expansion.\nOur business growth, profitability and market share has been enhanced by us engaging in strategic mergers and acquisitions and de novo branching either within or contiguous to our existing footprint. We may acquire other financial institutions or parts of those institutions in the future and engage in additional de novo branching. We may also consider and enter into or acquire new lines of business or offer new products or services and through new sales channels, such as online and mobile banking. As part of our acquisition strategy, we seek companies that are culturally similar to us, have experienced management and are in markets in which we operate or close to those markets so we can achieve economies of scale.\nWe expect to continue to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities that are presented to us in our current and expected markets and conduct due diligence related to those opportunities, as well as negotiate to acquire or merge with other institutions. If we announce a transaction, we may issue equity securities, including common stock and securities convertible into shares of our common stock in connection with future acquisitions. We also may issue debt to finance one or more transactions, including subordinated debt issuances. Generally, acquisitions of financial institution involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, resulting in dilution of our book value and fully diluted earnings per share, as well as dilution to our existing shareholders. We also face litigation risks with respect to potential mergers and acquisitions, and such litigation is common. We may incur substantial costs to expand, and we can give no assurance such expansion will result in the levels of profits we seek. There is no assurance that, following any future mergers or acquisitions, our integration efforts will be successful or our company, after giving effect to the acquisition, will achieve increased revenues comparable to or better than our historical experience, and failure to realize such expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in market presence or other benefits could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions and results of operations.\nAttractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us in the future.\nWhile we seek continued organic growth, we anticipate continuing to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities presented to us in our core markets and beyond. The number of financial institutions headquartered in our\nmarket areas in the Southeastern United States and across the country continues to decline through merger and other activity. We expect that other banking and financial companies, many of which have significantly greater resources, will compete with us to acquire financial services businesses. This competition, as the number of appropriate merger targets decreases, could increase prices for potential acquisitions which could reduce our potential returns, and reduce the attractiveness of these opportunities to us. In addition, acquisitions are subject to various regulatory approvals, and if we fail to receive the appropriate regulatory approvals, we will not be able to consummate an acquisition that we believe is in our best interests. Among other things, our regulators consider our capital, liquidity, profitability, risk management, regulatory compliance, including with respect to AML obligations, consumer protection laws, CRA obligations, and levels of goodwill and intangibles when considering acquisition and expansion proposals.\nThe standards by which bank and financial institution acquisitions will be evaluated are currently in flux and some banking organizations, including us, are experiencing delays in the processing of applications. In July 2021, President Biden issued an executive order on competition that requires the banking agencies to review the standards for bank mergers, and the DOJ has announced that it is reviewing its bank merger guidelines. It is expected that these reviews will tighten the standards for bank mergers and may change how the financial stability factor is evaluated. In addition, some in Congress have called for a moratorium of any bank merger and acquisition of greater than $100 billion in assets. While the Company is still much smaller in asset size than $100 billion, we cannot exclude that we may be subject to higher antitrust standards, enhanced scrutiny under the financial stability risk factor, or have a potential acquisition denied. Any acquisition could be dilutive to our earnings and shareholders\u2019 equity per share of our common stock.\nThe transition from LIBOR to an alternative rate may adversely affect our business.\nLIBOR and certain other interest rate benchmarks are the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals to reform. These reforms have caused and may in the future cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, or to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be predicted.\nThe publication of most LIBOR rates ceased as of the end of December 2021. While certain U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors are expected to continue to be published until June 23, 2023, the U.S. federal banking agencies have encouraged banks to cease entering new contracts that use U.S. dollar LIBOR by December 31, 2021. The Bank discontinued the use of LIBOR in new contracts as of December 31, 2021. A transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates and other potential interest rate benchmark reforms has begun and will continue over the course of the next few years.\nWhile there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, a group of large banks, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee, selected and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing in April 2018, the Secured Overnight Finance Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), as an alternative to LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities, given the depth and robustness of the U.S. Treasury repurchase market. On July 29, 2021, the ARRC announced that it is formally recommending CME Group\u2019s forward-looking SOFR term rates. The bank has approved and is using SOFR term rates as an alternative to LIBOR in new contracts. While the use of SOFR term rates appears to have gained significant acceptance following the ARRC recommendation. at this time, it is impossible to predict whether other SOFR-based rates will become accepted alternatives to LIBOR.\nThe market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, including SOFR, is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, any such transition could:\n\u2022\nadversely impact the value of LIBOR-based securities, including certain of our floating rate corporate debentures or our hedging instruments, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally;\n\u2022\nalthough the Bank has implemented language in in its hedging and loan documents to accommodate a change from LIBOR to an alternative pricing benchmark, including SOFR, we may be required to make further changes to existing LIBOR-based products;\n\u2022\nprompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of our preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate;\n\u2022\nresult in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based securities; and\n\u2022\nrequire the transition and/or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition our risk management processes from LIBOR-based products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmark, such as SOFR.\nThe manner and impact of this transition, as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs, loan and investment and trading securities portfolios, asset-liability management, and business, is uncertain.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit with the SEC is accurately accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived or operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control systems are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the reality that judgments and decision making can be faulty, that alternative reasoned judgments can be drawn, or that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an authorized override of the controls. In addition, properly integrating our acquisitions into our disclosure controls and procedures in a timely manner presents challenges. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our controls systems, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected, which could result in a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting and the restatement of previously filed financial statements.\nOur accounting policies and processes are critical to how we report our financial condition and results of operations and require our management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.\nAccounting policies and processes are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Some of these polices require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Several of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, we are required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including and determining credit loss reserves, reserves related to litigation and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, among other items. If the assumptions or estimates underling our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses.\nCertain of our financial instruments, including trading assets and liabilities, securities, and certain loans, among other items, require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our financial statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management judgment. Some of these and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable price levels, making their valuation particularly subjective, being based on significant estimation and judgment. In addition, some illiquidity in markets and declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment, it could lead to declines in our earnings.\nAs a participating lender in the SBA PPP, the Company and the Bank continue to be subject to the additional risks of litigation from the Bank\u2019s customers or other parties regarding the Bank\u2019s processing of loans and related forgiveness for the PPP and risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties.\nLaws enacted during the pandemic included a loan program administered through the SBA referred to as the PPP. The SBA expanded this program in January 2021 to allow eligible companies that obtained loans through the first round of PPP to obtain additional loans, as well as allow eligible companies that had not yet obtained a loan under the PPP to do so. The Bank participated as a lender in two rounds of the PPP and we originated approximately $3.2 billion\nthough the PPP program of which all but approximately 8%, or $263 million, excluding unamortized deferred fees and costs, has been forgiven. If PPP borrowers fail to qualify for loan forgiveness, the Bank faces a heightened risk of holding these loans at unfavorable interest rates for an extended period of time. While the PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA, various regulatory requirements will apply to the Bank\u2019s ability to seek recourse under the guarantees.\nThe Bank also has credit risk on outstanding PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded, or serviced by the Bank, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP. Such deficiency also may be found in the event the Bank discovers any evidence of fraud relating to a PPP loan. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by the Company or evidence of fraud, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from the Company. Incidents of borrower fraud in connection with PPP loans also might expose the Company to additional litigation risk, regulatory scrutiny and reputational damage, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operational results.\nThe value of securities in our investment portfolio may decline in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we owned $7.2 billion of investment securities. The fair value of our investment securities may be adversely affected by market conditions, including changes in interest rates, and the occurrence of any events adversely affecting the issuer of particular securities in our investments portfolio. With adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 326 effective January 1, 2020, we no longer evaluate securities for other-than-temporary impairments as the new accounting guidance changes the accounting for recognizing impairment on available for sale and held to maturity securities. We analyze our available for sale securities on a quarterly basis on an individual basis to determine if there has been a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis of a security to determine whether there is a credit loss associated with the decline in fair value. We consider the nature of the collateral, potential future changes in collateral values, default rates, delinquency rates, third-party guarantees, credit ratings, interest rate changes since purchase, volatility of the security\u2019s fair value and historical loss information for financial assets secured with similar collateral among other factors. We use a systematic methodology to determine the ACL for investment securities held to maturity. The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the held to maturity portfolio. We consider the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. Our estimate of the ACL involves a high degree of judgement; therefore, our process for determining expected credit losses my result in a range of expected credit losses. We monitor the held to maturity portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether a valuation account needs to be recorded. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers, we may be required to recognize expected credit losses on securities in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nConsumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions through alternative methods that historically have involved banks. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts, mutual funds or general purpose reloadable prepaid cards. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \u201cdisintermediation,\u201d could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business, and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nOur reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring, and retaining and providing growth opportunities for employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers, and caring about our customers and employees. If our reputation is\nnegatively affected by the actions of our employees or otherwise, including as a result of a successful cyberattack against us or other unauthorized release or loss of customer information, our business and, therefore, our operating results, may be materially adversely affected.\nRisks relating to the Regulatory Environment\nWe are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to examination, supervision, and comprehensive regulation by various agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the OCC, CFPB and the FDIC. This regulation is imposed primarily to protect depositors, the FDIC deposit insurance fund, consumers, and the banking system as a whole. We also are regulated by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, which regulation is designed to protect investors. Our compliance with these regulations is costly and potentially restricts certain of our activities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged, interest rates paid and deposits and locations of our offices. We are also subject to capital guidelines established by our regulators, which require us to maintain sufficient capital to support our growth. Regulation of the financial services industry has increased significantly since the global financial crisis. The laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time. The extent and timing of any regulatory reform as well as any effect on our business and financial results, are uncertain. Additionally, legislation or regulation may impose unexpected or unintended consequences, the impact of which is difficult to predict. Because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies, our cost of compliance could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably.\nIn addition, we expect that the Biden Administration and the Democratically-controlled Congress will seek to implement a more stringent regulatory agenda that is focused on climate change and fair lending issues. This agenda could include a heightened focus on the regulation of loan portfolios and credit concentrations to borrowers impacted by climate change, heightened scrutiny on Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering requirements, topics related to social equity, executive compensation, and increased capital and liquidity, as well as limits on share buybacks and dividends. In addition, mergers and acquisitions could be dampened by increased antitrust scrutiny. We also expect reform proposals for the short-term wholesale markets. It is too early for us to assess which, if any of these policies, would be implemented and what their impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations would be.\nAs the Company grows, the heightened expectations of regulatory agencies may expose us to additional regulatory risk.\nAs the Company grows above $50 billion in assets, the Company will be expected to bolster its risk management and governance framework to support a larger company. These expectations include established minimum standards for the design and implementation of the risk management framework and increased oversight and credible challenge by the board of directors over the Company\u2019s risk profile and risk management practices. Our existing enterprise risk framework and program may not be easily scalable to meet such heightened expectations, thereby requiring lengthy or costly modifications to meet such expectations. Further, the Company\u2019s existing workforce may not be sufficient or have the requisite skillset to design, operate and manage the bolstered framework, thereby requiring the Company to expend financial resources to hire and/or train the necessary staff. The Company\u2019s failure to meet such heightened expectations may expose it to regulatory enforcement actions and civil penalties which could have an adverse material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, operations and reputation and could jeopardize the Company\u2019s ability to pursue acquisition opportunities.\nWe are required to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, and if we fail to maintain sufficient capital, whether due to losses, an inability to raise additional capital or otherwise, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as our ability to maintain regulatory compliance, would be adversely affected.\nThe Company and the Bank each must meet regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity. Banking organizations experiencing growth, especially those making acquisitions, are expected to hold additional capital above regulatory minimums. From time to time, the regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. In recent years, these market and regulatory expectations have increased substantially and have resulted in higher and more stringent capital requirements for us and the Bank. For example, current capital requirements disallow\nthe Company\u2019s trust preferred securities from qualifying as Tier 1 capital as a result of the Company exceeding $15 billion in assets.\nActions (if necessary) to increase capital, may adversely affect us. Our ability to raise additional capital, when and if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry and market condition, and governmental activities, many of which are outside our control, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we fail to meet these capital and other regulatory requirements, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur failure to remain \u201cwell capitalized\u201d for bank regulatory purposes could affect customer confidence, our ability to grow, our costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, our ability to pay dividends on common stock and make distributions on our trust preferred securities, our ability to make acquisitions, and our business, results of operations and financial condition. Under FDIC rules, if our subsidiary bank ceases to be a \u201cwell capitalized\u201d institution for bank regulatory purposes, the interest rates that it pays and its ability to accept brokered deposits may be restricted. At December 31, 2021, we had approximately $325.0 million in wholesale brokered deposits, $52.0 million of in-market CDARs deposits, $848.1 million of ICS deposits and approximately $58.7 million of deposits related to our prepaid card business, which are considered brokered deposits for regulatory purposes.\nWe are subject to examination and scrutiny by a number of banking agencies and, depending upon the findings and determinations of these agencies, we may be required to make adjustments to our business that could adversely affect us.\nThe banking agencies regularly conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a banking agency were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, asset concentration, earning prospects, management, liquidity, sensitivity to market risk, consumer compliance, or other aspects of any of our operations has become unsatisfactory, or that we or our management is in violation of any law or regulation, it could take a number or different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to change the asset composition of our portfolio or balance sheet, to assess civil money penalties against our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance. If we become subject to such regulatory actions, our business, results of operations and reputation may be negatively impacted.\nThe Bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations, and any deemed deficiency by the Bank with respect to these laws could result in significant liability and have material impact on our business strategy.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective AML program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports when appropriate. The Bank is also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by OFAC regarding, among other things, the prohibition of transacting business with, and the need to freeze assets of, certain persons and organizations identified as a threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States. Please see Item I - Part 1 - Supervision and Regulation - Anti-Money Laundering Rules and Item 1 - Part 1 - Supervision and Regulation - OFAC Regulation for further information regarding the Bank\u2019s obligations under applicable AML laws and regulations and sanctions, respectively.\nIf the Bank\u2019s policies, procedures, and systems are deemed deficient, or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we have already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, the Bank could be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on its ability to pay dividends and the necessity and ability to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of its business plan, including acquisition plans. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for the Bank. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects.\nThe Bank is subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a material penalties and other sanctions.\nThe CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion, and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects.\nHigher FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured depository institutions, such as our subsidiary Bank, up to applicable limits. The amount of a particular institution\u2019s deposit insurance assessment is based on that institution\u2019s risk classification under an FDIC risk-based assessment system. The assessment base on which the Bank\u2019s deposit insurance premiums is paid to the FDIC has been calculated based on its average consolidated total assets less its average equity. However, effective January 1, 2019, which was following the fourth consecutive quarter where the Bank\u2019s total consolidated assets exceeded $10 billion, the FDIC started to use a performance score and loss-severity score to calculate the Bank\u2019s initial FDIC assessment rate. An institution\u2019s risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to its regulators. While our risk management processes are designed to reduce risk by maintaining capital levels and mitigating any supervisory concerns, we may be unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance in the event of a new economic downturn and an increase in financial institution failures. Any future increases in assessments or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums may materially adversely affect results of operations, including by reducing our profitability or limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities.\nThe Federal Reserve Board may require us to commit capital resources to support the Bank.\nApplicable law and the Federal Reserve Board require a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the \u201csource of strength\u201d doctrine, the Federal Reserve Board may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. Under these requirements, in the future, we could be required to provide financial assistance to our Bank if the Bank experiences financial distress.\nA capital injection may be required at times when we do not have the resources to provide it, and therefore we may be required to borrow the funds. In the event of a bank holding company\u2019s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the holding company\u2019s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations. Thus, any borrowing that must be done by the holding company in order to make the required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and will adversely impact the holding company\u2019s cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our income tax provision.\nWe compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any change in enacted tax laws, rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations, or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments and results of operations. The taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our tax positions, which could increase our effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations. We are subject to audit and review by U.S. federal and state tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, changes in enacted tax laws, such as adoption of a lower income tax rate in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, could impact our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets. In addition, the determination of our provision for income taxes and other\nliabilities requires significant judgment by management. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nRisks relating to our Common Stock\nState law and provisions in our articles of incorporation or bylaws could make it more difficult for another company to purchase us, even though such a purchase may increase shareholder value.\nIn many cases, shareholders may receive a premium for their shares if we were purchased by another company. State law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws could make it difficult for anyone to purchase us without the approval of our board of directors.\nOur articles of incorporation provide that a merger, exchange or consolidation of the Company with, or the sale, exchange or lease of all or substantially all of our assets to, any person or entity (referred to herein as a \u201cFundamental Change\u201d), must be approved by the holders of at least 80% of our outstanding voting stock if the board of directors does not recommend a vote in favor of the Fundamental Change. The articles of incorporation further provide that a Fundamental Change involving a shareholder that owns or controls 20% or more of our voting stock at the time of the proposed transaction (a \u201cControlling Party\u201d) must be approved by the holders of at least (i) 80% of our outstanding voting stock, and (ii) 67% of our outstanding voting stock held by shareholders other than the Controlling Party, unless (a) the transaction has been recommended to the shareholders by a majority of the entire board of directors or (b) the consideration per share to be received by our shareholders generally is not less than the highest price per share paid by the Controlling Party in the acquisition of its holdings of our common stock during the preceding three years. The approval by the holders of at least 80% of our outstanding voting stock is required to amend or repeal these provisions contained in our articles of incorporation. Finally, in the event that any such Fundamental Change is not recommended by the board of directors, the holders of at least 80% of our outstanding voting stock must attend a meeting called to address such transaction, in person or by proxy, in order for a quorum for the conduct of business to exist. If the 80% and 67% vote requirements described above do not apply because the board of directors recommends the transaction or the consideration is deemed fair, as applicable, then pursuant to the provisions of the South Carolina Business Corporation Act, the Fundamental Change generally must be approved by two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast with respect thereto.\nConsequently, a takeover attempt may prove difficult, and shareholders may not realize the highest possible price for their securities.\nShares of our Common Stock are not insured deposits and may lose value.\nShares of our common stock are not savings or deposit accounts and are not insured by the FDIC, or any other agency or private entity. Such shares are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of some or all of the value of your investment.\nFuture capital needs could result in dilution of shareholder investment.\nOur board of directors may determine from time to time there is a need to obtain additional capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other securities. These issuances would dilute the ownership interest of our shareholders and may dilute the per share book value of our common stock. New investors also may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our shareholders which may adversely impact our shareholders.\nThe trading volume in our common stock and the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could depress the price of our common stock.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of our common stock in the market, or availability of shares of our common stock for sale in the market, will have on the market price of our common stock. Our stock price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors. General market fluctuations, industry factors, and general economic and political conditions and events, such as terrorist attacks, economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes, tax rate changes, credit loss trends, or currency fluctuations, also could cause our stock price to decrease\nregardless of operating results. We therefore can give no assurance that sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the market, or the potential for large amounts of sales in the market, or any of the other factors discussed above, would not cause the price of our common stock to decline or impair our ability to raise capital through sales of our common stock.\nOur ability to pay dividends is limited and we may be unable to pay future dividends.\nOur ability to pay dividends is limited by regulatory restrictions and the need to maintain sufficient consolidated capital. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us is limited by its obligations to maintain sufficient capital and by other general restrictions on its dividends that are applicable to national banks that are regulated by the OCC. For information on these regulatory restrictions on the right of the Bank to pay dividends to us and on the right of the Company to pay dividends to its shareholders, see Part I - Item 1 - \u201cSupervision and Regulation - Dividend Restrictions.\u201d If we do not satisfy these regulatory requirements, or if the Bank does not have sufficient earnings to make payments to us while maintaining adequate capital levels, we will be unable to pay dividends on our common stock.\nHolders of our junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of our common shareholders.\nWe have helped support our continued growth through the issuance of, and the acquisition of, through prior mergers, trust preferred securities from special purpose trusts and accompanying junior subordinated debentures. The Company redeemed $38.5 million of trust preferred securities in the second and third quarters of 2021, and as of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding trust preferred securities and accompanying junior subordinated debentures totaling $117.2 million, net of fair value adjustments. Payments of the principal and interest on these debt instruments are conditionally guaranteed by us. Further, the accompanying junior subordinated debentures we issued to the special purpose trusts are senior to our shares of common stock. As a result, we must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and, in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the junior subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on our common stock. We have the right to defer distributions on our junior subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) for up to five years, during which time no dividends may be paid on our common stock.\nOur stock price may be volatile, which could result in losses to our investors and litigation against us.\nOur stock price has been volatile in the past and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future. These factors include but are not limited to: actual or anticipated variations in earnings; changes in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections; our announcement of developments related to our businesses, operations and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers; new technology used or services offered by traditional and non-traditional competitors; news reports of trends, concerns, irrational exuberance on the part of investors, and other issues related to the financial services industry. Our stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future, and these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance. General market declines or market volatility in the future, especially in the financial institutions sector, could adversely affect the price of the Company\u2019s common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices.\nStock price volatility may make it more difficult for our investors to resell their common stock when they desire and at prices they find attractive. Moreover, in the past, securities class action lawsuits have been instituted against some companies following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We could in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our normal business.\nAt December 31, 2021, our shareholders included three funds owning approximately 24% of our common stock and they may exercise significant influence over us and their interests may be different from our other shareholders.\nBased on their 13G forms filed for the year end December 31, 2021, our shareholders include three funds that collectively own approximately 24% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Top ten institutional owners collectively own approximately 49% of our outstanding shares of common stock, as reported by S&P Global. While the federal banking laws require prior bank regulatory approval if shareholders owning in excess of 9.9% of a financial holding company\u2019s outstanding voting shares desire to act in concert, these institutional owners nonetheless could vote the same way on matters submitted to our shareholders without being deemed to be acting in concert and, if so, could\nexercise significant influence over us and actions taken by our shareholders. Interests of institutional funds may be different from our other shareholders. Accordingly, given their collective ownership, the funds could have significant influence over whether or not a proposal submitted to our shareholders receives required shareholder approval.\nRisks relating to Economic Conditions and other Outside Forces\nThe political and economic environment could materially impact our business operations and financial performance.\nThe political and economic environment in the United States and elsewhere has resulted in some uncertainty. Changing regulatory policies because of the changing political environment, including the Biden Administration and Democratically-controlled Congress, could be seen as increasing our regulatory and compliance costs, or decreases in the amount of expected revenues, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAdditionally, financial markets may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including escalating military tension between Russia and Ukraine, terrorism or other geopolitical events.\nA slowdown in economic growth or a resumption of recessionary economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our business in the future.\nThe economic crisis of 2008 followed by the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected the banking industry, as well as financial condition and operating results. Although economic conditions are improving and growth has been stronger during the second half of 2021, future political and market developments could affect consumer confidence levels and cause adverse changes in loan payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which may impact our charge-offs and the provision for credit losses. For example, changes in international trade policy, combined with the outbreak of COVID-19, continues to disrupt global supply chains, and also has led to inflationary pressures on goods and services, as well as wages. These circumstances could adversely impact our customers and their customers, which in turn could impact their ability to make loan payments, with the impacts to our business listed above. Changes in the financial services industry and the effects of current and future law and regulations that may be imposed in response to future market developments also could negatively affect us by restricting our business operations, including our ability to originate or sell loans, and adversely impact our financial performance.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. Defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and losses of depositor, creditor and counterparty confidence and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. We could experience increases in deposits and assets as a result of other banks\u2019 difficulties or failure, which would increase the capital we need to support our growth.\nOur business is subject to the success of the local economies where we operate.\nOur success significantly depends upon the growth in population, income levels, deposits and housing starts in our primary and secondary markets. If the communities in which we operate do not grow or if prevailing economic conditions locally or nationally become challenging, our business may be adversely affected. We are less able than a larger institution to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies. We cannot give any assurance we will continue to benefit from market growth or favorable economic conditions in our primary market areas if they do occur.\nAdverse weather or manmade events could negatively affect our local economies or disrupt our operations, which would have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nOur market areas in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Virginia and Alabama are susceptible to hurricanes, tropical storms and related flooding and wind damage as well as tornados and other types of strong storms.\nThese type of storms may increase in intensity because of changes in weather patterns and other factors including climate change. Such weather events and manmade events can disrupt operations, result in damage to properties and negatively affect the local economies in the markets where they operate. Storms during 2021 only minimally impacted our operations but we cannot predict whether or to what extent damage that may be caused by future natural disasters or manmade events will affect our operations or the economies in our current or future market areas. Such events could result in a decline in loan originations, a decline in the value or destruction of properties securing our loans, as well as our own properties, and an increase in delinquencies, bankruptcies, foreclosures or loan losses that could result in a higher level of non-performing assets, net charge-offs, and provision for loan losses. Our business or results of operations may be adversely affected by these and other negative effects of future hurricanes, tropical storms, tornados or other extreme weather events, including flooding and wind damage, or manmade events. Many of our customers have incurred significantly higher property and casualty insurance premiums on their properties located in our markets, which may adversely affect real estate sales and values in those markets.\nWe are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change and other weather and natural disaster impacts.\nThe current and anticipated effects of climate change are creating an increasing level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result, political and social attention to the issue of climate change has increased. In recent years, governments across the world have entered into international agreements to attempt to reduce global temperatures, in part by limiting greenhouse gas emissions. Although the U.S. rejoined the Paris Agreement, effective as of February 19, 2021, and the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies have continued to propose and advance numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives seeking to mitigate the effects of climate change, each of which may result in the imposition of taxes and fees, the required purchase of emission credits, and the implementation of significant operational changes, which may require us to expend significant capital and incur compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. Given the lack of empirical data on the credit and other financial risks posed by climate change, it is impossible to predict how climate change may impact our financial condition and operations; however, as a banking organization, the physical effects of climate change on the Bank may present certain unique risks.\nThe physical risks of climate change include discrete events, such as flooding, hurricanes, tornadoes, and wildfires, and longer-term shifts in climate patterns, such as extreme heat, sea level rise, and more frequent and prolonged drought. Physical risks may alter the Company\u2019s strategic direction in order to mitigate certain financial risks. A significant portion of our operations is located in the areas bordering the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, regions that are susceptible to hurricanes, or in areas of the Southeastern U.S. that are susceptible to tornadoes and other severe weather events including severe droughts, floods, and sea level rise. Any of these, or any other severe weather event, could cause disruption to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our overall business, results of operations or financial condition. We have taken certain preemptive measures that we believe will mitigate these adverse effects; however, such measures cannot prevent the disruption that a catastrophic earthquake, fire, hurricane, tornado or other severe weather event could cause to the markets that we serve and any resulting adverse impact on our customers, such as hindering our borrowers\u2019 ability to timely repay their loans, diminishing the value of any collateral held by us, interrupting supply chains, causing significant property damage, causing us to incur additional expense or resulting in a loss of revenue, and affecting the stability of our deposit base. The severity and impact of future earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, sea level rise, floods and other weather-related events are difficult to predict and may be exacerbated by global climate change. Man-made disasters and other events connected with the Gulf of Mexico or Atlantic Ocean, such as oil spills, could have similar effects. Such events may also cause reductions in regional and local economic activity that may have an adverse effect on our customers, which could limit our ability to raise and invest capital in these areas and communities, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nClimate change may worsen the frequency and severity of future earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, sea level rise, floods and other extreme weather-related events that could cause disruption to our business and operations. Chronic results of climate change such as shifting weather patterns could also cause disruption to our business and operations. Climate change may also result in new and/or more stringent regulatory requirements for the Company, which could materially affect the Company\u2019s results of operations by requiring the Company to take costly measures to comply with any new laws or regulations related to climate change that may be forthcoming. New regulations, shift in customer behaviors, supply chain collapse or breakthrough technologies that accelerate the transition to a lower carbon economy may negatively affect certain sectors and borrowers in our loan portfolio, impacting their ability to timely repay their loans or decreasing the value of any collateral held by us.\nMarket volatility could adversely affect our operations or ability to access capital.\nThe capital and credit markets have experienced volatility and disruption from time to time during the past several years. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers\u2019 underlying financial condition or performance. If these periodic market disruptions and volatility continue or worsen, we may experience adverse effects, which may be material, on our ability to maintain or access capital and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur cost of funds may increase as a result of general economic conditions, FDIC insurance assessments, interest rates and competitive pressures.\nOur cost of funds may increase as a result of general economic conditions, FDIC insurance assessments, interest rates and competitive pressures. We have traditionally obtained funds principally through local deposits and we have a base of lower cost transaction deposits. Generally, we believe local deposits are a less expensive and more stable source of funds than other borrowings because interest rates paid for local deposits are typically lower than interest rates charged for borrowings from other institutional lenders and reflect a mix of transaction and time deposits, whereas brokered deposits typically are higher cost time deposits. Our costs of funds and our profitability and liquidity are likely to be adversely affected, if and to the extent we have to rely upon higher cost borrowings from other institutional lenders or brokers to fund loan demand or liquidity needs, and changes in our deposit mix and growth could adversely affect our profitability and the ability to expand our loan portfolio.\nCompetition from financial institutions and other financial service providers may adversely affect our profitability.\nThe banking business is highly competitive and we experience competition in our markets from many other financial institutions. We compete with commercial banks, credit unions, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds, and other mutual funds, as well as other super-regional, national and international financial institutions and fintech or e-commerce companies that operate in our primary market areas and elsewhere. Some of these competitors may have a long history of successful operation in our markets, greater ties to local businesses and more expansive banking relationships, as well as better established depositor bases. Competitors with greater resources or more advanced technology may possess an advantage by being capable of maintaining numerous and more convenient banking locations, easy to use and available mobile and computer apps or Internet platforms, operating more ATMs and conducting extensive promotional and advertising campaigns.\nWe compete with these institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans. In addition, we have to attract our customer base from other existing financial institutions and from new residents. Many of our competitors are well-established, larger financial institutions and credit unions. While we believe we can and do successfully compete with these other financial institutions in our primary markets, we may face a competitive disadvantage as a result of our smaller size, lack of geographic diversification, sophisticated online or mobile applications, and inability to spread our marketing costs across a broader market. Although we compete by concentrating our marketing efforts in our primary markets with local advertisements, personal contacts, and greater flexibility and responsiveness in working with local customers, we can give no assurance this strategy will be successful.\nThe fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nThe Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. as its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and return earned on those loans and investments, both of which affect our net interest margin. They can also materially decrease the value of financial assets we hold. Federal Reserve policies also can adversely affect borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans, or could result in volatile markets and rapid declining collateral values. Changes in Federal Reserve policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict. Accordingly, the impact of these changes on our activities and results of operations is difficult to predict.\nWe are or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations, and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences.\nMany aspects of the banking business involve a substantial risk of legal liability. The Company and the Bank\nhave been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from our business activities (and in some cases from the activities of companies that we have acquired). In addition, from time to time, we are, or may become, the subject of self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings, and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank regulatory agencies, the SEC and law enforcement authorities. The results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way the Company and the Bank conduct their business, or reputational harm.", "PERMNO": 84389, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SSB"}
