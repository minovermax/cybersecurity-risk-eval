You should consider them carefully when evaluating an investment in PTC\u2019s securities or any forward-looking statements made by us, including those contained in this Annual Report, because these factors could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or\nthe performance projected in forward-looking statements. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.\nI. Operational Considerations\nOur operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter, making future operating results difficult to predict; failure to meet market expectations could cause the price of our securities to decline.\nOur quarterly operating results historically have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\na high percentage of our revenue historically has been generated in the third month of each fiscal quarter and any failure to receive, complete or process orders at the end of any quarter could cause us to fall short of our revenue targets;\n\u2022\na significant percentage of our revenue comes from transactions with large customers, which tend to have long lead times that are less predictable;\n\u2022\none or more industries that we serve may have weak or negative growth;\n\u2022\nour operating expenses are largely fixed in the short term and are based on expected revenues and any failure to achieve our revenue targets could cause us to miss our earnings targets as well;\n\u2022\nour mix of license, subscription and service revenues can vary from quarter to quarter, creating variability in our operating margins;\n\u2022\nbecause a significant portion of our revenue comes from outside the U.S. and a significant portion of our expense structure is located internationally, shifts in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our reported results; and\n\u2022\nwe may incur significant expenses in a quarter in connection with corporate development initiatives, restructuring efforts or the investigation, defense or settlement of legal actions that would increase our operating expenses and reduce our earnings for the quarter in which those expenses are incurred.\nAccordingly, our quarterly results are difficult to predict prior to the end of the quarter and we may be unable to confirm or adjust expectations with respect to our operating results for a particular quarter until that quarter has closed. Any failure to meet our quarterly revenue or earnings targets could adversely impact the market price of our securities.\nWe now offer our solutions as subscriptions, which will adversely affect our revenue and earnings in the transition period and make predicting our revenue and earnings more difficult.\nWe began offering most of our solutions under a subscription option in 2015, in addition to our perpetual license option. Under a subscription, customers pay a periodic fee for the right to use our software and receive support, or to use our cloud services and have us manage the application for a specified period. We believe that a significant number of our customers will elect to purchase our solutions as subscriptions rather than under a perpetual license (if available). Until we have fully transitioned to a stable mix of subscription and perpetual license purchases, we expect that our license revenue will decrease due to the difference in revenue recognition for a subscription license (revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the license) and a perpetual license (revenue is generally recognized upon purchase) and that our support revenue (which comprises a significant portion of our revenue) may also decrease due to support services being included in the subscription offering.\nOur revenue and earnings targets are based on assumptions about the mix of revenue that will be attributable to subscription and perpetual license revenue. If a greater percentage of our customers elect to purchase our solutions as subscriptions in a period than we assumed, our revenue and earnings will likely fall below our expectations for that period, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur long range financial targets are predicated on revenue growth and operating margin improvements that we may fail to achieve, which could reduce our expected earnings and cause us to fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors and cause the price of our securities to decline.\nWe are projecting long-term revenue and earnings growth. However, as we transition to a subscription model, our plan through 2021 assumes that our license revenue and earnings will decrease in 2016, 2017 and 2018 due to lower up-front revenue recognized for a subscription license compared to a perpetual license, and assumes increases in revenue from a recurring subscription revenue stream beginning in 2019. Our projections are based on the expected growth potential in the IoT and SLM markets, with more modest growth expectations for CAD and ePLM. We may not achieve the expected bookings and\nrevenue growth if the markets we serve do not grow at expected rates, if we are not able to deliver solutions desired by customers and potential customers, and/or if acquired businesses do not generate the revenue growth that we expect.\nOur long-term operating margin improvement is predicated on operating leverage as long range revenue increases, improved operating efficiencies, particularly within our sales organization and service margin improvements. Services margins are significantly lower than license and support margins. Future projected improvements in our operating margin as a percent of revenue are based in part on our ability to improve services margins by reducing the amount of direct services that we perform through expansion of our service partner program, and improving the profitability of services that we perform. If our services revenue increases as a percentage of total revenue and/or if we are unable to improve our services margins, our overall operating margin may not increase to the levels we expect or may decrease. Additionally, if we do not achieve lower sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue through productivity initiatives, we may not achieve our operating margin targets. If operating margins do not improve, our earnings could be adversely affected and the price of our securities could decline.\nOur significant investment in our Technology Platform business may not generate the revenues we expect.\nWe have made a significant investment in recent years in our Technology Platform business, including four acquisitions totaling approximately $450 million. Our Technology Platform business provides technology solutions that enable customers to transform their businesses and leverage the opportunities created by the Internet of Things (IoT).\nThe Technology Platform market is a new market for us that requires us to adopt a new sales approach. The go-to-market approach for the Technology Platform business relies on an extensive and differentiated partner ecosystem to enable us to access markets and customers beyond our traditional markets, customers and buyers. We also expect to focus on marketing directly to software application developers to become the Technology Platform of choice for the IoT. We may be unable to expand our partner ecosystem as we expect and developers may not adopt our Technology Platform solutions as we expect, which would adversely affect our ability to realize revenue from our investments in this business.\nFurther, the Internet of Things is a relatively new market and there are a significant number of competitors in the market. If the market does not expand as rapidly as we or others expect or if customers adopt competitive solutions rather than our solutions, our Technology Platform business may not generate the revenues we expect.\nBusinesses we acquire may not generate the revenue and earnings we anticipate and may otherwise adversely affect our business.\nWe have acquired, and intend to continue to acquire, new businesses and technologies. If we fail to successfully integrate and manage the businesses and technologies we acquire, or if an acquisition does not further our business strategy as we expect, our operating results will be adversely affected.\nMoreover, business combinations also involve a number of risks and uncertainties that can adversely affect our operations and operating results, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties managing an acquired company\u2019s technologies or lines of business or entering new markets where we have limited or no prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions;\n\u2022\nunanticipated operating difficulties in connection with the acquired entities, including potential declines in revenue of the acquired entity;\n\u2022\nfailure to achieve the expected return on our investments which could adversely affect our business or operating results and impair the assets that we recorded as a part of an acquisition including intangible assets and goodwill;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management and employee attention;\n\u2022\nloss of key personnel;\n\u2022\nassumption of unanticipated legal or financial liabilities or other unidentified issues with the acquired business;\n\u2022\npotential incompatibility of business cultures;\n\u2022\nsignificant increases in our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition; and\n\u2022\nif we were to issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with future acquisitions, existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease.\nOur restructuring actions and reorganization may be disruptive and could harm our operations.\nOver the past few years, we have taken a number of restructuring actions and reorganizations designed to realign our global workforce to our business needs, reduce our expenses and enable us to increase investment in our Technology Platform business. These actions may not have the expected long-term effect on our expenses or may not be sufficient to fully offset additional investments we may make in our business. Disruptions in operations have occurred and will likely continue to occur as a result of these actions. Disruptions may include attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce, a negative effect on employee morale or our ability to attract highly skilled employees. Further, we could experience delays, business disruptions, decreased productivity, unanticipated employee turnover and increased litigation related costs in connection with the restructuring and other efficiency initiatives.\nWe recently committed to a plan to reduce costs and realign investments with what we believe are our high growth opportunities by reducing our workforce and consolidating facilities. This restructuring may result in higher charges than anticipated and / or our actual projected expense reductions may fall below our expectations.\nWe depend on sales within the discrete manufacturing sector and our business could be adversely affected if manufacturing activity does not grow or if it contracts.\nA large amount of our revenue is related to sales to customers in the discrete manufacturing sector. If this economic sector does not grow, or if it contracts, our customers in this sector may, as they have in the past, reduce or defer purchases of our products and services, which adversely affects our business. In 2015, the manufacturing sector was weak, particularly in the Americas and China, which we believe adversely impacted our sales and operating results in those regions in 2015. We expect global manufacturing economic conditions could continue to adversely impact our results in 2016, particularly in the U.S. and China.\nWe face significant competition, which may reduce our profits and limit or reduce our market share.\nThe market for product development solutions and IoT solutions is rapidly changing and characterized by vigorous competition, both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies. This competition could result in price reductions for our products and services, reduced margins, loss of customers and loss of market share. Our primary competition comes from:\n\u2022\nlarger companies that offer competitive solutions;\n\u2022\nlarger, more well-known enterprise software providers with greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, and other resources; and\n\u2022\nother vendors of various competitive point solutions or IoT platforms.\nIn addition, barriers to entry into certain segments of the software industry have declined and the ability of customers to adopt software solutions has increased with the ability to offer software in the cloud and the increasing prevalence of subscription license models and customer acceptance of both those models. Because of these and other factors, competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future.\nIncreased competition could result in price reductions, reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share, any of which would likely harm our business.\nA breach of security in our products or computer systems, or those of our third-party service providers, could compromise the integrity of our products, harm our reputation, create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results.\nWe have implemented and continue to implement measures intended to maintain the security and integrity of our products, source code and computer systems. The potential consequences of a security breach or system disruption (particularly through cyber-attack or cyber-intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists) have increased in scope as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Despite efforts to create security barriers to such threats, it is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate this risk. In addition, we offer cloud services to our customers and some of our products are hosted by third-party service providers, which expose us to additional risks as those repositories of our customers\u2019 proprietary data may be targeted by such hackers. A significant breach of the security and/or integrity of our products or systems, or those of our third-party service providers, could prevent our products from functioning properly, could enable access to sensitive, proprietary or confidential information, including that of our customers, without authorization, or could disrupt our business operations or those of our customers. This could require us to incur significant costs of remediation, harm our reputation, cause customers to stop buying our products,\nand cause us to face lawsuits and potential liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur sales and operations are globally dispersed, which exposes us to additional compliance risks.\nWe sell and deliver software and services, and maintain support operations, in a large number of countries whose laws and practices differ from one another and are subject to unexpected changes. Managing these geographically dispersed operations requires significant attention and resources to ensure compliance with laws of those countries and those of the U.S. governing our activities in non-U.S. countries.\nThose laws include, but are not limited to, anti-corruption laws and regulations (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010) and trade and economic sanctions laws and regulations (including laws administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. State Department, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the United Nations Security Council and other relevant sanctions authorities). The FCPA and UK Bribery Act prohibit us and business partners or agents acting on our behalf from offering or providing anything of value to persons considered to be foreign officials under those laws for the purposes of obtaining favorable treatment. The UK Bribery Act also prohibits commercial bribery and accepting bribes. Our compliance risks with these laws are heightened due to the global nature of our business, the fact that we operate in, and are expanding into, countries with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices than others, and the fact that we deal with governments and state-owned business enterprises, the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA and the UK Bribery Act.\nAccordingly, while we strive to maintain a comprehensive compliance program, we cannot guarantee that an employee, agent or business partner will not act in violation of our policies or U.S. or other applicable laws. Investigations of alleged violations of those laws can be expensive and disruptive. Violations of such laws can lead to civil and/or criminal prosecutions, substantial fines and other sanctions, including the revocation of our rights to continue certain operations and also cause business and reputation loss. For example, as discussed in Risk Factors II. Other Considerations, we are currently in discussions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and U.S. Department of Justice to attempt to resolve an investigation concerning certain payments and expenses by certain business partners and employees in China that raise questions of compliance with laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and/or compliance with our business policies.\nOur international businesses present economic and operating risks.\nWe expect that our international operations will continue to expand and to account for a significant portion of our total revenue. Because we transact business in various foreign currencies, the volatility of foreign exchange rates has had and may in the future have a material adverse effect on our revenue, expenses and operating results.\nOther risks inherent in our international operations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales and development operations;\n\u2022\npossible future limitations upon foreign-owned businesses;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022\ninadequate local infrastructure; and\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in protecting our intellectual property.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights.\nOur software products are proprietary. We protect our intellectual property rights in these items by relying on copyrights, trademarks, patents and common law safeguards, including trade secret protection, as well as restrictions on disclosures and transferability contained in our agreements with other parties. Despite these measures, the laws of all relevant jurisdictions may not afford adequate protection to our products and other intellectual property. In addition, we frequently encounter attempts by individuals and companies to pirate our software. If our measures to protect our intellectual property rights fail, others may be able to use those rights, which could reduce our competitiveness and revenues.\nIn addition, any legal action to protect our intellectual property rights that we may bring or be engaged in could be costly, may distract management from day-to-day operations and may lead to additional claims against us, and we may not succeed, all of which would materially adversely affect our operating results.\nIntellectual property infringement claims could be asserted against us, which could be expensive to defend and could result in limitations on our use of the claimed intellectual property.\nThe software industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights, as well as improper disclosure of confidential or proprietary information. If a lawsuit of this type is filed, it could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. We cannot be sure that we would prevail against any such asserted claims. If we did not prevail, we could be prevented from using the claimed intellectual property or be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which might not be available on terms acceptable to us. In addition to possible claims with respect to our proprietary products, some of our products contain technology developed by and licensed from third parties and we may likewise be susceptible to infringement claims with respect to these third-party technologies.\nSome of our products contain \u201copen source\u201d software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business and subject us to possible litigation.\nSome of our products incorporate so-called \u201copen source\u201d software and we may incorporate open source software into other products in the future. Such open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. We monitor our use of open source software in an effort to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend. Although we believe that we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for open source software that we use, our processes used to monitor how open source software is used could be improperly followed or subject to error.\nIf an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations. If our defenses were not successful, we could be subject to significant damages. We could also be enjoined from the distribution of our products that contained the open source software or be required to modify our products in order to comply with the conditions of the open source license(s) in question, thereby disrupting the distribution and sale of some of our products. In addition, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, under some open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software, which would adversely affect our ability to derive revenue from the affected products.\nOur financial condition could be adversely affected if significant errors or defects are found in our software.\nSophisticated software can sometimes contain errors, defects or other performance problems. If errors or defects are discovered in our products, we may need to expend significant financial, technical and management resources, or divert some of our development resources, in order to resolve or work around those defects, and we may not be able to correct them in a timely manner or provide an adequate response to our customers.\nErrors, defects or other performance problems in our products could also cause us to lose revenue, lose customers and lose market share, and could subject to liability. Such defects or problems could also damage our business reputation and cause us to lose new business opportunities.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate, which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income.\nAs a multinational organization, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision and other tax liabilities. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our tax returns are subject to review by various taxing authorities. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes could be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\nOur effective tax rate can be adversely affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, regulations, and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate;\n\u2022\nassessments, and any related tax interest or penalties, by taxing authorities;\n\u2022\nchanges in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;\n\u2022\nchanges to the financial accounting rules for income taxes;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in tax rates; and\n\u2022\nchanges to a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets, if any.\nBecause we have substantial cash requirements in the United States and a significant portion of our cash is generated and held outside of the United States, if our cash available in the United States and the cash available under our credit facility is insufficient to meet our operating expenses and debt repayment obligations in the United States, we may be required to raise cash in ways that could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and the market price of our securities.\nWe have significant operations outside the United States. As of September 30, 2015, approximately 72% of our cash and cash equivalents balance was held by subsidiaries outside the United States, with the remainder of the balance held by the U.S. parent or its subsidiaries in the United States. We believe that the combination of our existing United States cash and cash equivalents, future United States operating cash flows and cash available under our credit facility, are sufficient to meet our ongoing United States operating expenses and known capital requirements. However, if these sources of cash are insufficient to meet our future financial obligations in the United States, we will be required to seek other available funding sources or means to repatriate cash to the United States, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position and the market price of our securities.\nII. Other Considerations\nWe have been investigating certain matters in China, the resolution of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results.\nWe have been in discussions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) to resolve an investigation concerning expenditures by our business partners in China and by our China business, including for travel and entertainment, that apparently benefited employees of customers regarded as state owned enterprises in China. This matter involves issues regarding compliance with laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. We have recorded liabilities of $28.2 million as a result of our agreements in principle with those agencies to settle the matter. There can be no assurance that we will enter into final settlements on the agreed terms with these agencies or, if not, that the cost of any final settlements, if reached, would not exceed the existing accrual. Further, any settlement or other resolution of this matter could have collateral effects on our business in China, the United States and elsewhere.\nWe are required to comply with certain financial and operating covenants under our credit facility and to make scheduled debt payments as they become due; any failure to comply with those covenants or to make scheduled payments could cause amounts borrowed under the facility to become immediately due and payable and/or prevent us from borrowing under the facility.\nOur credit facility consists of a $1 billion revolving loan commitment that matures on September 15, 2019, at which time all remaining amounts outstanding will be due and payable in full. As of November 4, 2015, we had $718 million outstanding under the credit facility. We may wish to borrow additional amounts under the facility in the future to support our operations, including for strategic acquisitions and share repurchases.\nWe are required to comply with specified financial and operating covenants and to make payments under the facility, which limit our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might operate it. Our failure to comply with any of these covenants or to meet any payment obligations under the facility could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, would result in any amounts outstanding, including any accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. We might not have sufficient working capital or liquidity to satisfy any repayment obligations in the event of an acceleration of those obligations. In addition, if we are not in compliance with the financial and operating covenants at the time we wish to borrow funds, we will be unable to borrow funds.\nWe may be unable to meet our goal of returning 40% of free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases, which could decrease your expected return on investment in PTC stock.\nIn August 2014, we announced a new capital allocation strategy, a component of which is a long-term goal of returning approximately 40% of free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) to shareholders through share repurchases. Meeting this goal requires PTC to generate consistent free cash flow in the years ahead in an amount sufficient to enable us to continue investing in organic and inorganic growth as well as to return a significant portion of the cash generated to stockholders in the form of share repurchases. We may not meet this goal if we do not generate the free cash flow we expect or if we use our available cash to satisfy other priorities. In addition, our cash flow fluctuates over the course of the year and over multiple years, so, although our goal is to return 40% of free cash flow to shareholders, that is an average over a longer\nterm and the number of shares repurchased and amount of free cash flow returned in any given period will vary and may be more or less than 40% in any such period. Finally, the number of shares repurchased for a given amount of cash will vary based on PTC\u2019s stock price, so the number of shares repurchased will not be a consistent or predictable number or percentage of outstanding stock.\nOur stock price has been volatile, which may make it harder to resell your shares at a time and at a price that is favorable to you.\nMarket prices for securities of software companies are generally volatile and are subject to significant fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of ours, may not be predictable. Negative changes in the public\u2019s perception of the prospects of software companies, or of PTC or the markets we serve, could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results.\nAlso, a large percentage of our common stock is held by institutional investors. Purchases and sales of our common stock by these institutional investors could have a significant impact on the market price of the stock. For more information about those investors, please see our proxy statement with respect to our most recent annual meeting of stockholders and Schedules 13D and 13G filed with the SEC with respect to our common stock.", "PERMNO": 75912, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "PTC"}
