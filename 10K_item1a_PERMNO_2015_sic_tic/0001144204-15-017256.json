RISK FACTORS\nAN INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES IS HIGHLY SPECULATIVE AND INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. WE FACE A VARIETY OF RISKS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND MANY OF THOSE RISKS ARE DRIVEN BY FACTORS THAT WE CANNOT CONTROL OR PREDICT. BEFORE INVESTING IN THE SECURITIES YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISKS, TOGETHER WITH THE FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS ACTUALLY OCCURS, OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN THAT CASE, THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK WOULD LIKELY DECLINE AND INVESTORS MAY LOSE ALL OR A PART OF THEIR INVESTMENT.\nTHIS REPORT CONTAINS CERTAIN STATEMENTS RELATING TO FUTURE EVENTS OR THE FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF OUR COMPANY. READERS ARE CAUTIONED THAT SUCH STATEMENTS ARE ONLY PREDICTIONS AND INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, AND THAT ACTUAL EVENTS OR RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY. IN EVALUATING SUCH STATEMENTS, READERS SHOULD SPECIFICALLY CONSIDER THE VARIOUS FACTORS IDENTIFIED IN THIS REPORT, INCLUDING THE MATTERS SET FORTH BELOW, WHICH COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE INDICATED BY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.\nThe risks described below do not purport to be all the risks to which the Company could be exposed. This section is a summary of certain risks and is not set out in any particular order of priority. They are the risks that we presently believe are material to the operations of the Company. Additional risks of which we are not presently aware or which we presently deem immaterial may also impair the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Business and the Industry in Which We Operate\nWe have a limited operating history upon which investors can evaluate our future prospects.\nAlthough Ekso Bionics was incorporated in 2005, it did not sell its first Ekso medical device until 2012. Therefore, we have limited operating history upon which an evaluation of our business plan or performance and prospects can be made. The business and prospects of the Company must be considered in the light of the potential problems, delays, uncertainties and complications encountered in connection with a newly established business and creating a new industry. The risks include, but are not limited to, the possibility that we will not be able to develop functional and scalable products and services, or that although functional and scalable, our products and services will not be economical to market; that our competitors hold proprietary rights that preclude us from marketing such products; that our competitors market a superior or equivalent product; that we are not able to upgrade and enhance our technologies and products to accommodate new features and expanded service offerings; or that we fail to receive necessary regulatory clearances for our products. To successfully introduce and market our products at a profit, we must establish brand name recognition and competitive advantages for our products. There are no assurances that the Company can successfully address these challenges. If it is unsuccessful, the Company and its business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nGiven the limited operating history, management has little basis on which to forecast future demand for our products from our existing customer base, much less new customers. The current and future expense levels of the Company are based largely on estimates of planned operations and future revenues rather than experience. It is difficult to accurately forecast future revenues because the business of the Company is new and its market has not been developed. If the forecasts for the Company prove incorrect, the business, operating results and financial condition of the Company will be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, the Company may be unable to adjust its spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unanticipated reduction in revenue. As a result, any significant reduction in revenues would immediately and adversely affect the business, financial condition and operating results of the Company.\nThe industries in which the Company operates are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. If our competitors are better able to develop and market products that are safer, more effective, less costly, easier to use, or are otherwise more attractive, we may be unable to compete effectively with other companies.\nThe medical technology, industrial robotics and military equipment industries are characterized by intense competition and rapid technological change, and we will face competition on the basis of product features, clinical outcomes, price, services and other factors. Competitors may include large medical device and other companies, some of which have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do, and firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets. Our competition may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do or may be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners.\nOur competitive position will depend on multiple, complex factors, including our ability to achieve market acceptance for our products, develop new products, implement production and marketing plans, secure regulatory approvals for products under development and protect our intellectual property. In some instances, competitors may also offer, or may attempt to develop, alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device. The development of new or improved products, processes or technologies by other companies may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive. The entry into the market of manufacturers located in low-cost manufacturing locations may also create pricing pressure, particularly in developing markets. Our future success depends, among other things, upon our ability to compete effectively against current technology, as well as to respond effectively to technological advances, and upon our ability to successfully implement our marketing strategies and execute our research and development plan.\nOur products may not be accepted in the market.\nWe cannot be certain that our current products or any other products we may develop or market will achieve or maintain market acceptance. Market acceptance of our products depends on many factors, including the Company\u2019s ability to convince key opinion leaders to provide recommendations regarding our products, convince distributors and customers that our technology is an attractive alternative to other technologies, demonstrate that our products are reliable and supported by us in the field, supply and service sufficient quantities of products directly or through marketing alliances, and price products competitively in light of the current macroeconomic environment, which, particularly in the case of the medical device industry, are becoming increasingly price sensitive.\nDependence on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to such rights may result in our payment of significant monetary damages or adversely impact our product offerings.\nOur long-term success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products. If we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies or may lose access to technologies critical to our products. Also, our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents, and issued patents are subject to claims concerning priority, scope and other issues.\nFurthermore, we have not filed applications for all of our patents internationally and may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies or may lose access to technologies critical to our products in other countries. These include, in some cases, countries in which we are currently selling products and countries in which we intend to sell products in the future.\nIntellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain of our products.\nThe industries in which we operate, including, in particular, the medical device industry, are characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and, from time to time, we might be the subject of claims by third parties of potential infringement or misappropriation. Regardless of outcome, such claims are expensive to defend and divert the time and effort of our management and operating personnel from other business issues. A successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments or negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products in the affected category and could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.\nSome of the patents in the intellectual property portfolio are not within our complete control, which could reduce the value of such patents.\nSome of our U.S. patent applications (which have associated international applications) are co-owned by the Regents of the University of California Berkeley. The Regents of the University of California Berkeley has licensed its rights under many of these patent applications to us, but we do not have a license to their rights under three of these patent applications. With respect to two of these co-owned patent applications, the Regents of the University of California Berkeley has licensed their rights in the U.S. to an unrelated third party. The third patent application will need to be fully prosecuted before it can be determined which claims are exclusive to us (through a previous license) and which claims the Regents of the University of California Berkeley may license to other entities. We do not have complete control over the prosecution of these patent applications. In addition, the license of patent rights under these patents to third parties could reduce the value of the Company\u2019s patent portfolio and limit any income or license fees that we might receive if we were to attempt to transfer or license our rights under any of our co-owned patents.\nEnforcing intellectual property rights in foreign nations for military technology may be more problematic than enforcement in other industries.\nIn many countries, governments reserve the right to allow local manufacturers to infringe patents in cases where it is beneficial to their national security to do so. This could result in additional competition for us or our licensees from local manufacturers in foreign countries even though those manufacturers are infringing patents we hold in those countries, which could adversely affect our ability to sell our products in those countries for military use.\nThe regulatory approval and clearance processes are expensive, time-consuming and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining approvals or clearances, as the case may be, for the continued commercialization of some or all of our products.\nOur medical technology products and operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d), the European Union and other governmental authorities both inside and outside of the United States. These agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing and distribution, and market surveillance of our medical products. It can be costly and time-consuming to obtain regulatory approvals to market a medical device. Our failure to obtain and maintain clearances or approvals for medical device products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In general, unless an exemption applies, we are not permitted to market our products in the United States until we receive a clearance letter under the 510(k) process or approval of a PMA from the FDA, depending on the nature of the device.\nWhile we believe that the Company\u2019s Ekso GT robotic exoskeleton has been appropriately marketed as a Class I 510(k) exempt Powered Exercise Equipment device since February 2012, on June 26, 2014, the FDA announced the creation of a new product classification for Powered Exoskeleton devices. On October 21, 2014, FDA published the summary for the reclassified Powered Exoskeleton. FDA also issued us an Untitled Letter which informed us of the agency\u2019s belief that this new product classification applied to the Ekso GT device. This new product classification was designated as being Class II, which requires the clearance of a 510(k). FDA requested that we file a 510(k) notice to obtain this clearance. Despite the new regulation, we cannot be certain of the regulatory pathway we will need to follow until FDA has fully reviewed a 510(k) notice for the device. The Company filed a 510(k) notice on December 24, 2014, and this submission is under review. While the FDA normally reviews a premarket notification in 90 days, there is no guarantee that the FDA will review it expeditiously or determine that the device is substantially equivalent to a lawfully marketed non-PMA device.\nRegulatory clearance pursuant to a 510(k) premarket notification is not guaranteed, and the clearance process is expensive, uncertain and may take several months. The FDA also has substantial discretion in the medical device clearance process. Despite the time and expense exerted, failure can occur at any stage, and we could encounter problems that cause us to repeat or perform additional development, standardized testing, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. The number of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for FDA clearance or approval varies depending on the medical device candidate, the disease or condition that the medical device candidate is designed to address, and the regulations applicable to any particular medical device candidate. The FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of a medical device candidate for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7 a medical device candidate may not be deemed to be substantially equivalent to a device lawfully marketed either as a grandfathered device or one that was cleared through the 510(k) premarket notification process;\n\u00b7 a medical device candidate may not be deemed to be in conformance with applicable standards and regulations;\n\u00b7 FDA or other regulatory officials may not find the data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials sufficient;\n\u00b7 other non-U.S. regulatory authorities may not approve our processes or facilities or those of any of our third-party manufacturers, thereby restricting export; or\n\u00b7 the FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities may change clearance or approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nThe regulatory classification for Powered Exoskeleton devices is new and fairly specific. We have recently submitted a 510(k) for our Ekso robotic exoskeleton which is currently under FDA review. We intend to continue to market our Ekso robotic exoskeleton until the 510(k) is cleared. FDA may disagree with this decision and require us to cease marketing and distribution until 510(k) clearance is obtained or subject us to fines and penalties.\nWe have been marketing the Ekso GT robotic exoskeleton as a Class I 510(k) exempt Powered Exercise Equipment device since February 2012. On June 26, 2014, the FDA announced the creation of a new product classification for Powered Exoskeleton devices. On October 21, 2014, FDA published the summary for the reclassified Powered Exoskeleton and informed us in writing, via an \u201cUntitled Letter\u201d, the agency\u2019s belief that this new product classification applied to our Ekso GT device. This new product classification was designated as being Class II, which requires the clearance of a 510(k). While the new Powered Exoskeleton classification is broadly similar to the Ekso robotic exoskeleton, it includes specific terms, such as \u201cuser controlled\u201d and \u201cwrist worn wireless interface,\u201d that do not apply to the Ekso robotic exoskeleton in its current marketed form as a clinical device for gait training by medical personnel. The \u201cuser controlled\u201d and \u201cwrist worn wireless interface\u201d features are, however, in line with a robotic exoskeleton that is intended for use outside the supervision of medical staff (i.e. in the home/community), for which the Ekso labeling clearly contraindicates. As a result of these discrepancies, some ambiguity exists as to the application of this product classification to the Ekso robotic exoskeleton. We filed a 510(k) notice for the Ekso robotic exoskeleton on December 24, 2014, and this submission is currently under review at the FDA.\nThe Company intends to continue marketing the Ekso robotic exoskeleton under its current Class I registration and listing with its current indications for use until 510(k) clearance is either granted or denied by the FDA or the Company is otherwise notified by the FDA to cease from such activities. The Company believes that in situations where the class of a product has been elevated by FDA, manufacturers are normally granted enforcement discretion by FDA and given ample time to seek clearance at the new class level. Nonetheless, the FDA may not agree with our decision to continue marketing the device until a 510(k) is cleared. If the FDA disagrees with our decision, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the products until we obtain clearance or approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. Any of these sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAny failure or significant delay in completing clinical trials for our products could materially harm our financial results and the commercial prospects for our products.\nInitiating and completing clinical trials necessary to support 510(k) clearance can be time consuming and expensive and the outcome uncertain. Moreover, the results of early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, and any product we advance into clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials. Conducting successful clinical studies requires the enrollment of large numbers of patients, and suitable patients may be difficult to identify and recruit. Patient enrollment in clinical trials and completion of patient participation and follow-up depends on many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the attractiveness of, or the discomforts and risks associated with, the treatments received by enrolled subjects, the availability of appropriate clinical trial investigators and support staff, proximity of patients to clinical sites, patient ability to meet the eligibility and exclusion criteria for participation in the clinical trial and patient compliance. For example, patients may be discouraged from enrolling in our clinical trials if the trial protocol requires them to undergo extensive post-treatment procedures or follow-up to assess the safety and effectiveness of our products or if they determine that the treatments received under the trial protocols are not attractive or involve unacceptable risks or discomforts. Patients may also not participate in our clinical trials if they choose to participate in contemporaneous clinical trials of competitive products. In addition, patients participating in clinical trials may die before completion of the trial or suffer adverse medical events unrelated to investigational products.\nTo date, the Ekso device has been the subject of several clinical studies, some sponsored by the Company, as well as non-Ekso-sponsored independent studies conducted by rehabilitation institutions. Data from these studies have been provided to FDA a part of the pending 510(k) submission, In addition, we are currently conducting several studies to investigate additional indications for use for the Ekso device, as well as to evaluate clinical and non-clinical outcomes of using the Ekso device. Sufficient and appropriate clinical protocols to demonstrate safety and efficacy are required and we may not adequately develop such protocols to support clearance and approval. Further, the FDA may require us to submit data on a greater number of patients than we originally anticipated and/or for a longer follow-up period or change the data collection requirements or data analysis applicable to our clinical trials. Delays in patient enrollment or failure of patients to continue to participate in a clinical trial may cause an increase in costs and delays in the approval and attempted commercialization of our products or result in the failure of the clinical trial. In addition, despite considerable time and expense invested in our clinical trials, the FDA may not consider our data adequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Such increased costs and delays or failures could adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects.\nThe results of clinical trials may not support product submissions or claims or may result in the discovery of adverse side effects.\nThe Ekso device has been the subject of several clinical studies, some sponsored by the Company, as well as non-Ekso-sponsored independent studies conducted by rehabilitation institutions. We are currently conducting several studies to investigate additional indications for use for the Ekso device, as well as to evaluate clinical and non-clinical outcomes of using the Ekso device. All clinical trial activities that we undertake are subject to extensive regulation and review by numerous governmental authorities both in the United States and abroad. Clinical studies intended to support a 510(k) or PMA must be conducted in compliance with the FDA\u2019s Good Clinical Practice regulations and similar requirements in foreign jurisdictions. Even if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support our product candidate claims or that the FDA or foreign authorities and Notified Bodies will agree with our conclusions regarding them. Success in pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the later trials will replicate the results of prior trials and pre-clinical studies. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for the proposed indicated uses, which could cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of others. Any delay or termination of our clinical trials will delay the filing of associated product submissions and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize products requiring submission of clinical data. It is also possible that patients enrolled in a clinical trial will experience adverse side effects that are not currently part of the product candidate\u2019s safety profile, which could cause us to delay or abandon development of such product.\nOnce our products are cleared or approved, modifications to our products may require new 510(k) clearances, premarket approvals or new or amended CE Certificates of Conformity, and may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified products until clearances, approvals or the relevant CE Certificates of Conformity are obtained.\nAny modification to a 510(k)-cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, design, or manufacture, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, possibly, a PMA. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA may review such determinations. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances or approvals are necessary. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations for any future changes, or prior changes to previously marketed products, as the case may be, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified products until we obtain clearance or approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.\nFurthermore, the FDA\u2019s ongoing review of the 510(k) program may make it more difficult for us to make modifications to our products, either by imposing more strict requirements on when a new 510(k) for a modification to a previously cleared product must be submitted, or applying more onerous review criteria to such submissions. In July and December 2011, respectively, the FDA issued draft guidance documents addressing when to submit a new 510(k) due to modifications to 510(k) cleared products and the criteria for evaluating substantial equivalence. The July 2011 draft guidance document was ultimately withdrawn, and as a result, the FDA\u2019s original guidance document regarding 510(k) modifications, which dates back to 1997, remains in place. It is uncertain when the FDA will seek to issue new guidance on product modifications. Any efforts to do so could result in a more rigorous review process and make it more difficult to obtain clearance for device modifications.\nEven if we obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for our products, the terms thereof and ongoing regulation of our products may limit how we manufacture and market our products, which could materially impair our ability to generate anticipated revenues or profit margins.\nOnce regulatory clearance or approval has been granted, a cleared or approved product and its manufacturer are subject to continual review. Any cleared or approved product may be promoted only for its indicated uses. In addition, if the FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities clear or approve any of our products, the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising and promotion for the product will be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA, either before or after clearance or approval, or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities, or if previously unknown problems with our products or manufacturing processes are discovered, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:\n\u00b7 restrictions on the products, manufacturers or manufacturing process;\n\u00b7 adverse inspectional observations (Form 483), warning letters, non-warning letters incorporating inspectional observations;\n\u00b7 civil or criminal penalties or fines;\n\u00b7 injunctions;\n\u00b7 product seizures, detentions or import bans;\n\u00b7 voluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements;\n\u00b7 suspension or withdrawal of regulatory clearances or approvals;\n\u00b7 total or partial suspension of production;\n\u00b7 imposition of restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements;\n\u00b7 refusal to clear or approve pending applications or premarket notifications; and\n\u00b7 import and export restrictions.\nIf imposed on us, any of these sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to extensive post-market regulation by the FDA. Our failure to meet strict regulatory requirements could require us to pay fines, incur other costs or even close our facilities.\nEven after we have obtained the proper regulatory clearance or approval to market a product, such as our Ekso robotic exoskeleton, the FDA has the power to require us to conduct post-market studies. These studies can be very expensive and time-consuming to conduct. Failure to complete such studies in a timely manner could result in the revocation of clearance or approval and the recall or withdrawal of the product, which could prevent us from generating sales from that product in the United States. The FDA has broad enforcement powers, and any regulatory enforcement actions or inquiries, or other increased scrutiny on us, could dissuade some customers from using our products and adversely affect our reputation and the perceived safety and efficacy of our products.\nWe are also currently, and will continue to be after we receive 510(k) clearance, required to comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which covers the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage, shipping, installation and servicing of our marketed products. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections of manufacturing facilities. In addition, in the future, regulatory authorities and/or customers may require specific packaging of sterile products, which could increase our costs and the price of our products. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, manufacturing problems, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements such as QSR, may result in changes to labeling, restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of the products from the market, voluntary or mandatory recalls, a requirement to repair, replace or refund the cost of any medical device we manufacture or distribute, fines, suspension of regulatory approvals, product seizures, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties which would adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nIf our products, or malfunction of our products, cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions. In addition, product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations.\nUnder the FDA\u2019s medical device reporting, or MDR, regulations, we are required to report to the FDA any incident in which our product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. Repeated product malfunctions may result in a voluntary or involuntary product recall, which could divert managerial and financial resources, impair our ability to manufacture our products in a cost-effective and timely manner, and have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition. We are also required to follow detailed recordkeeping requirements for all firm-initiated medical device corrections and removals, and to report such corrective and removal actions to the FDA if they are carried out in response to a risk to health and have not otherwise been reported under the MDR regulations.\nWhen a medical human exoskeleton is used by a paralyzed individual to walk, the individual relies completely on the exoskeleton to hold them upright. There are many exoskeleton components that, if they were to fail catastrophically, could cause a fall resulting in severe injury or death of the patient. Such occurrences could bring about costly litigation and could also bring about regulatory activity on the part of the FDA or its foreign counterparts which could interfere with our ability to market our products.\nWhen an industrial or military exoskeleton is used by a healthy individual - for example to carry a heavy load - malfunction of the device at an inopportune moment (such as when descending a stairway or navigating a precarious trail) could cause a fall resulting in severe injury or death of the person using the device. Such occurrences could bring about costly litigation and could also bring about regulatory activity on the part of OSHA or its foreign counterparts which could interfere with our ability to market our products\nAll manufacturers bringing medical devices to market in the EEA are legally bound to report any incident that led or might have led to the death or serious deterioration in the state of health of a patient, user or other person, and which the manufacturer\u2019s device is suspected to have caused, to the competent authority in whose jurisdiction the incident occurred. In such case, the manufacturer must file an initial report with the relevant competent authority, which would be followed by further evaluation or investigation of the incident and a final report indicating whether further action is required.\nAny adverse event involving our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement action. We cannot guarantee that adverse events involving our products, such as Ekso robotic exoskeleton, will not occur in the future. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business and may harm our reputation and financial results. Personal injuries relating to the use of our products could also result in product liability claims being brought against us. In some circumstances, such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals.\nA recall of our products, either voluntarily or at the direction of the FDA or another governmental authority, or the discovery of serious safety issues with our products, could have a significant adverse impact on us.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues.\nAny future recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and could have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition, which could impair our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet our customers\u2019 demands. We may also be required to bear other costs or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our future sales and our ability to generate profits.\nU.S. legislative or FDA regulatory reforms may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates and to manufacture, market and distribute our products after approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory approval, manufacture and marketing of regulated devices. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of future products. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.\nFor example, the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently cleared products on a timely basis. For example, the FDA recently issued guidance documents intended to explain the procedures and criteria the FDA will use in assessing whether a 510(k) submission meets a minimum threshold of acceptability and should be accepted for review. Under the \u201cRefuse to Accept\u201d guidance, the FDA conducts an early review against specific acceptance criteria to inform 510(k) submitters if the submission is administratively complete, or if not, to identify the missing element(s). Submitters are given the opportunity to provide the FDA with the identified information, but if the information is not provided within a defined time, the submission will not be accepted for FDA review.\nAny change in the laws or regulations that govern the clearance and approval processes relating to our current and future products could make it more difficult and costly to obtain clearance or approval for new products, or to produce, market and distribute existing products. Significant delays in receiving clearance or approval, or the failure to receive clearance or approval for our new products would have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business.\nWe may be subject to penalties and may be precluded from marketing our products if we fail to comply with extensive governmental regulations.\nThe FDA and non-U.S. regulatory authorities require that our products be manufactured according to rigorous standards. These regulatory requirements may significantly increase our production costs and may even prevent us from making our products in amounts sufficient to meet market demand. If we change our approved manufacturing process, the FDA may need to review the process before it may be used. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements discussed could subject us to enforcement actions, including warning letters, fines, injunctions and civil penalties against us, recall or seizure of our products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of our production, and criminal prosecution.\nFederal, state and non-U.S. regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of medical devices are subject to future changes. The complexity, timeframes and costs associated with obtaining marketing clearances are unknown. Although we cannot predict the impact, if any, these changes might have on our business, the impact could be material.\nCertain of our competitors have reported injuries caused by the malfunction of human exoskeleton devices (in at least one case to the FDA). Injuries caused by the malfunction or misuse of human exoskeleton devices, even where such malfunction or misuse occurs with respect to one of our competitor\u2019s products, could cause regulatory agencies to implement more conservative regulations on the medical human exoskeleton industry, which could significantly increase our operating costs.\nWe could be exposed to significant liability claims if we are unable to obtain insurance at acceptable costs and adequate levels or otherwise protect ourselves against potential product liability claims.\nThe testing, manufacture, marketing and sale of medical devices entail the inherent risk of liability claims or product recalls. Product liability insurance is expensive and may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. A successful product liability claim or product recall could inhibit or prevent the successful commercialization of our products, cause a significant financial burden on the Company, or both, which in either case could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIf we are not able to both obtain and maintain adequate levels of third-party reimbursement for our products, it would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nHealthcare providers and related facilities are generally reimbursed for their services through payment systems managed by various governmental agencies worldwide, private insurance companies, and managed care organizations. The manner and level of reimbursement in any given case may depend on the site of care, the procedure(s) performed, the final patient diagnosis, the device(s) utilized, available budget, or a combination of these factors, and coverage and payment levels are determined at each payer\u2019s discretion. The coverage policies and reimbursement levels of these third-party payers may impact the decisions of healthcare providers and facilities regarding which medical products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products. Thus, changes in reimbursement levels or methods may either positively or negatively impact sales of our products.\nThe Company has no direct control over payer decision-making with respect to coverage and payment levels for our medical device products. Additionally, we expect many payers to continue to explore cost-containment strategies (e.g., comparative and cost-effectiveness analyses, so-called \u201cpay-for-performance\u201d programs implemented by various public and private payers, and expansion of payment bundling schemes such as Accountable Care Organizations, and other such methods that shift medical cost risk to providers) that may potentially impact coverage and/or payment levels for our current products or products we develop.\nAs our product offerings are diverse across healthcare settings, they are affected to varying degrees by the many payment systems. Therefore, individual countries, product lines or product classes may be impacted by changes to these systems.\nChanges in reimbursement practices of third-party payers could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold.\nThe sales of our products could depend, in part, on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities or individual users are reimbursed by government authorities, private insurers and other third-party payers for the costs of our products or the services performed with our products. The coverage policies and reimbursement levels of third-party payers, which can vary among public and private sources and by country, may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products in a particular jurisdiction. Reimbursement rates can also affect the acceptance rate of new technologies. Legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the United States or abroad, or changes in reimbursement rates by private payers, could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using the Company\u2019s products or result in denial of reimbursement for those products, which would adversely affect customer demand or the price customers may be willing to pay for such products.\nClinical outcome studies regarding our products may not provide sufficient data to either cause third-party payers to approve reimbursement or to make human exoskeletons a standard of care.\nOur business plan relies on broad adoption of human exoskeletons to provide neuro-rehabilitation in the form of gait training to individuals who have suffered a neurological injury or disorder. Although use of human exoskeletons in neuro-rehabilitation is new, use of robotic devices to provide gait training has been going on for over a decade and the clinical studies relating to such devices have had both positive and negative outcomes. Much of the rehabilitation community has rejected the use of such devices based on the data from some of these studies. Although we believe that human exoskeletons will outperform such robotic equipment, this has not been proven. Furthermore, it may prove impossible to prove an advantage in a timely manner, or at all, which could prevent broad adoption of our products.\nPart of our business plan relies on broad adoption of the Ekso robotic exoskeleton to provide \u201cearly mobilization\u201d of individuals who have been immobilized by an injury, disease, or other condition. Although the health benefits of other methods of \u201cearly mobilization\u201d have been demonstrated in clinical studies in fields such as stroke, those studies did not test early mobilization with human exoskeletons directly. It may be necessary to provide outcome studies on early mobilization with exoskeletons directly in order to convince the medical community of their effectiveness. Such studies have not been designed at this time, and may be too large and too costly for us and our partners to conduct.\nThe technology of load carriage exoskeletons (such as the HULCTM human exoskeleton) is at a very early stage of development and the technology may not be broadly adopted in military or other markets.\nThe most recent testing of our Human Universal Load Carrier (\u201cHULC\u201dTM) technology showed that the metabolic cost of load carriage while wearing the device varied greatly from subject to subject. This implied that the device helped some subjects and hindered others. The source of this phenomenon and whether it will go away with training of the subjects using the device remains unknown and requires further research and development. This phenomenon and others like it could limit the adoption of such devices by militaries or other customers to a certain portion of their personnel or in the worst case could make it impractical to deploy at all. If Lockheed Martin Corporation is unable to market the HULC exoskeleton, it would negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain key employees.\nThe success of the Company depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain highly qualified managerial, technical and sales and marketing personnel. In addition, as the Company introduces new products or services, it will need to hire additional personnel. Currently, competition for personnel with the required knowledge, skill and experiences is intense, and the Company may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain such personnel. The inability to attract and retain the necessary managerial, technical and sales and marketing personnel could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of the Company.\nWe will experience long and variable sales cycles, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations for any given quarter and may result in volatility in our stock price.\nThe Ekso device has a lengthy sales and purchase order cycle because it is a major capital item and generally requires the approval of senior management at purchasing institutions, which may contribute to substantial fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. Other factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate include:\n\u2022 general economic uncertainties and political concerns;\n\u2022 the introduction of new products or product lines;\n\u2022 product modifications;\n\u2022 the level of market acceptance of new products;\n\u2022 the timing and amount of research and development and other expenditures;\n\u2022 timing of the receipt of orders from, and product shipments to, distributors and customers;\n\u2022 changes in the distribution arrangements for our products;\n\u2022 manufacturing or supply delays;\n\u2022 the time needed to educate and train additional sales and manufacturing personnel; and\n\u2022 costs associated with defending our intellectual property.\nIn addition to these factors, expenditures are based, in part, on expected future sales. If sales levels in a particular quarter do not meet expectations, we may be unable to adjust operating expenses quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall of sales, and our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nInternational sales of our products account for a portion of our revenues, which will expose the Company to certain operating risks. If we are unable to successfully manage our international activities, our net sales, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nOur business currently depends in part on our activities in Europe and other foreign markets, making it subject to a number of challenges that specifically relate to international business activities. These include:\n\u2022 failure of local laws to provide the same degree of protection against infringement of our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022 protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors, which could slow our growth in international markets;\n\u2022 the expense of establishing facilities and operations in new foreign markets;\n\u2022 building an organization capable of supporting geographically dispersed operations;\n\u2022 challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences;\n\u2022 challenges caused by differences in legal regulations, markets, and customer preferences, which may limit our ability to adapt our products or succeed in other regions;\n\u2022 multiple, conflicting, and changing laws and regulations, including complications due to unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, foreign laws, tax schemes, international import and export legislation, trading and investment policies, exchange controls and tariff and other trade barriers;\n\u2022 foreign tax consequences;\n\u2022 fluctuations in currency exchange rates and foreign currency translation adjustments;\n\u2022 foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating income earned outside the United States;\n\u2022 imposition of public sector controls;\n\u2022 political, economic and social instability; and\n\u2022 restrictions on the export or import of technology.\nIf we are unable to meet and overcome these challenges, then our international operations may not be successful, which could adversely affect our net sales, results of operations and financial condition and limit our growth.\nWe may be unable to manage our growth and entry into new business areas.\nIf the initial response to our exoskeleton products exceeds the Company\u2019s capacity to provide services timely and efficiently, then the Company may need to expand our operations accordingly and swiftly. Management of the Company believes that establishing industry leadership will require the Company to:\n\u2022 test, introduce and develop new products and services including enhancements to our Ekso device;\n\u2022 develop and expand the breadth of products and services offered;\n\u2022 develop and expand our market presence through relationships with third parties; and\n\u2022 generate satisfactory revenues from such expanded products or services to fund the foregoing requirements while obtaining and maintaining satisfactory profit margins.\nTo be able to expand our operations in a cost-effective or timely manner and increase the overall market acceptance of our products and services in this manner, we will need additional capital and technical and managerial human resources. These additional resources may not be available to the Company. Failure of the Company to timely and efficiently expand our operations and successfully achieve the four requirements listed above could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of the Company.\nThe disruption or loss of relationships with vendors and suppliers for the components of our products could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to manufacture and market our products successfully is dependent on relationships with both third party vendors and suppliers. Although most of the raw materials that the Company uses to manufacture our products are readily available from a number of suppliers, we generally procure raw materials and components through purchase orders, with no guaranteed supply arrangements. Our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of various components, if and as required in the future, may subject us to:\n\u2022 delays in delivery or shortages in components that could interrupt and delay manufacturing and result in cancellations of orders for our products;\n\u2022 increased component prices and supply delays as we establish alternative suppliers;\n\u2022 inability to develop alternative sources for product components;\n\u2022 required modifications of our products, which may cause delays in product shipments, increased manufacturing costs, and increased product prices; and\n\u2022 increased inventory costs as we hold more inventory than we otherwise might in order to avoid problems from shortages or discontinuance, which may result in write-offs if we are unable to use all such products in the future.\nIn addition, failure of any one supplier\u2019s components could result in a product recall, which could materially adversely affect our business, operations and cash flows.\nNew product introductions may adversely impact our financial results.\nWe may introduce new products with enhanced features and extended capabilities from time to time. The products will be subject to various regulatory processes, and we will need to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals in order to sell our new products. If a potential purchaser believes that we plan to introduce a new product in the near future or if a potential purchaser is located in a country where a new product that we have introduced has not yet received regulatory approval, planned purchases may be deferred or delayed. As a result, new product introductions may adversely impact our financial results.\nThe acquisition of other companies, businesses, or technologies could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other harmful consequences.\nWe may selectively pursue strategic acquisitions, any of which could be material to our business, operating results, and financial condition. Future acquisitions could divert management\u2019s time and focus from operating our business. In addition, integrating an acquired company, business or technology is risky and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization and integrating each company\u2019s accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative systems to permit effective management. The anticipated benefits of future acquisitions may not materialize. Future acquisitions or dispositions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. Future acquisitions may also require us to obtain additional financing, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nThe impact of United States healthcare reform legislation remains uncertain.\nIn 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cPPACA\u201d) was enacted into law. The legislation seeks to reform the United States healthcare system. It is far-reaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage, improve quality and reduce costs over time. We expect the new law will have a significant impact upon various aspects of our business operations. The PPACA reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals, clinical laboratories and pharmaceutical companies, and could otherwise reduce the volume of medical procedures. These factors, in turn, could result in reduced demand for our products and increased downward pricing pressure. It is also possible that the PPACA will result in lower reimbursements. While the PPACA is intended to expand health insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the United States, the impact of any overall increase in access to healthcare on sales of our products remains uncertain. In addition, the new law imposes a 2.3 percent excise tax on medical devices that will apply to United States sales of our medical device product. Many of the details of the new law will be included in new and revised regulations, which have not yet been promulgated, and require additional guidance and specificity to be provided by the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Labor and Department of the Treasury. Accordingly, while it is too early to understand and predict the ultimate impact of the new law on our business, the legislation and resulting regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nHealthcare changes in the United States and other countries resulting in pricing pressures could have a negative impact on our future operating results.\nIn addition to the PPACA, initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where we will do business. Pricing pressure has also increased in these markets due to continued consolidation among health care providers, trends toward managed care, the shift towards governments becoming the primary payers of health care expenses and laws and regulations relating to reimbursement and pricing generally. Reductions in reimbursement levels or coverage or other cost-containment measures could unfavorably affect our future operating results.\nContinuing worldwide macroeconomic instability, such as recent recessions in Europe and the debt crisis in certain countries in the European Union, could negatively affect our ability to conduct business in those geographies.\nSince 2008, the global economy has been impacted by the sequential effects of an ongoing global financial crisis which has caused extreme disruption in the financial markets, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability. There can be no assurance that further deterioration will not occur. Our customers and suppliers may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability to purchase our products or to pay for them on a timely basis, if at all. The continuing debt crisis in certain European countries could cause the value of the euro to deteriorate, reducing the purchasing power of our European customers. Failure to receive payment of all or a significant portion of our receivables could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers could result in product delays and inventory issues.\nNatural or other disasters could disrupt our business and result in loss of revenue or in higher expenses.\nNatural disasters, terrorist activities, military conflict and other business disruptions could seriously harm our revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. Our corporate headquarters are located in California, a seismically active region. A natural disaster in any of our major markets in North America or Europe could have a material adverse impact on our operations, operating results and financial condition. Further, any unanticipated business disruption caused by Internet security threats, damage to global communication networks or otherwise could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition\nWe have a history of losses and we may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred losses in each fiscal year since our incorporation in 2005. We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as we continue to invest to grow our business, acquire customers and develop our platform and new functionality. These efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenues sufficiently to offset these higher expenses.\nWe may not be able to reduce the cost to manufacture or service our products as planned.\nOur business plan assumes that exoskeletons can be manufactured more inexpensively than they are currently being manufactured. However, we have not yet found a way to significantly reduce the manufacturing cost of our products and doing so may prove more difficult than expected or even impossible. For example, if expectations for greater functionality of the products drive costs up as other factors drive costs down, the result may be that the overall cost of manufacturing the product stays the same or even increases. Likewise, we currently provide service and support of our products for our customers at a high standard (both in and out of warranty), and plan on continuing to do so. Our business plan also assumes that as we continue to improve our product, we achieve improved levels of product reliability and decreased service cost and frequency, which also may prove more difficult than expected.\nWe may not be able to leverage our cost structure or achieve better margins.\nDue to the early stage of our commercial efforts, and particularly the early stage of customer adoption of our products, our current sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses are each a higher percentage of sales than they will need to be for us to reach profitability. While we do expect these expenses to grow as the Company\u2019s business grows, we also expect these expenses to decline as a percentage of revenues over time. If we are unable to leverage these costs and grow revenues at a greater pace than these operating expenses as we expect, the Company will not be able to achieve viable operating margins and profitability.\nIf we are unable to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, we may have to curtail our growth or cease our development plans and operations.\nThe operation of our business and our growth efforts will require significant cash outlays and advance capital equipment expenditures and commitments. We are largely dependent on capital raised through our private placement offering that was completed in the first quarter of 2014 and through the subsequent exercise of warrants that were issued in the same financing to implement our business plan and support our operations. At the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash. We anticipate for the foreseeable future that cash on hand and cash generated from operations will not be sufficient to meet our cash requirements, and that we will need to raise additional capital through investments to fund our operations and growth. We cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional working capital as needed on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise capital as needed, we may be required to reduce the scope of our business development activities, which could harm our business plans, financial condition and operating results, or cease our operations entirely. Financings, if obtained, may be on terms that are dilutive to our stockholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the price at which existing stockholders purchased their shares.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Securities and Exchange Commission and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.\nChanges in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the U.S. and various jurisdictions outside the U.S. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes and penalties. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our consolidated earnings and financial condition. Additionally, changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially impact our effective tax rate. Proposals for fundamental U.S. corporate tax reform, if enacted, could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Capital Stock\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders or prevent or make more difficult certain transactions, including a sale or merger of the Company.\nIn the future, we may issue our authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders. The Company\u2019s current Articles of Incorporation authorize the Company to issue an aggregate of 500,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock. We may issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees, future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes, or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any such additional shares of our common stock will dilute the ownership interest of our current stockholders and may create downward pressure on the trading price of the common stock. In addition, the terms of any new securities may include liquidation or other preferences that may adversely affect the rights of our existing stockholders. Further, shares of voting or convertible preferred stock could be issued, or rights to purchase such shares could be issued, to create voting impediments or to frustrate persons seeking to effect a takeover or otherwise gain control of the Company. The ability of the Board to issue such additional shares of preferred stock, with rights and preferences it deems advisable, could discourage an attempt by a party to acquire control of the Company by tender offer or other means. Such issuances could therefore deprive stockholders of benefits that could result from such an attempt, such as the realization of a premium over the market price for their shares in a tender offer or the temporary increase in market price that such an attempt could cause. Moreover, the issuance of such additional shares of preferred stock to persons friendly to the Board of Directors could make it more difficult to remove incumbent officers and directors from office even if such change were to be favorable to stockholders generally.\nThere currently is a limited trading market for our common stock. Failure to maintain a trading market could negatively affect the value of our common stock and make it difficult or impossible for existing stockholders to sell their shares.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTC Markets under the symbol \u201cEKSO.\u201d The OTC Markets is a thinly traded market and lacks the liquidity of certain other public markets with which some investors may have more experience. We may not ever be able to satisfy the listing requirements for our common stock to be listed on a national securities exchange, which is often a more widely-traded and liquid market. Some, but not all, of the factors which may delay or prevent the listing of our common stock on a more widely-traded and liquid market include the following: our stockholders\u2019 equity may be insufficient; the market value of our outstanding securities may be too low; our net income from operations may be too low; our common stock may not be sufficiently widely held; we may not be able to secure market makers for our common stock; and we may fail to meet the rules and requirements mandated by the several exchanges and markets to have our common stock listed. Should we fail to satisfy the initial listing standards of the national exchanges, or our common stock is otherwise rejected for listing, and remains listed on the OTC Markets or is suspended from the OTC Markets, the trading price of our common stock could suffer and be subject to increased volatility. In addition, if we remain listed on the OTC, the shares of our common stock may trade infrequently and in low volumes, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common shares at or near bid prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. An investor may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock or to sell his or her shares at or near bid prices or at all.\nIn addition, if we fail to meet the criteria set forth in SEC regulations, various requirements would be imposed by law on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. Consequently, such regulations may deter broker-dealers from recommending or selling our common stock, which may further affect the liquidity of our common stock. This would also make it more difficult for us to raise capital.\nOur common stock is subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules of the SEC and the trading market in the securities is limited, which makes transactions in the stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in the stock.\nRule 15g-9 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) establishes the definition of a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require: (a) that a broker or dealer approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks; and (b) the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.\nIn order to approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must: (a) obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person and (b) make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.\nThe broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form: (a) sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and (b) confirms that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our common stock.\nDisclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker or dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nWe have never paid and do not intend to pay cash dividends.\nCash dividends have never been declared or paid on our common stock, and we do not anticipate such a declaration or payment for the foreseeable future. We expect to use future earnings, if any, to fund business growth. Therefore, stockholders will not receive any funds absent a sale of their shares of common stock. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.\nBeing a public company is expensive and administratively burdensome and such costs will increase once we cease to be either a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d or an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nAs a public reporting company, we are subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), the Exchange Act and other federal securities laws, rules and regulations related thereto, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Complying with these laws and regulations requires the time and attention of our Board of Directors and management, and increases our expenses. Among other things, we are required to:\n\u2022 maintain and evaluate a system of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;\n\u2022 maintain policies relating to disclosure controls and procedures;\n\u2022 prepare and distribute periodic reports in compliance with our obligations under federal securities laws;\n\u2022 institute a more comprehensive compliance function, including with respect to corporate governance; and\n\u2022 involve, to a greater degree, our outside legal counsel and accountants in the above activities.\nThe costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC and furnishing audited reports to stockholders is expensive and much greater than that of a privately-held company, and compliance with these rules and regulations may require us to hire additional financial reporting, internal controls and other finance personnel, and will involve a material increase in regulatory, legal and accounting expenses and the attention of management. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the applicable regulations in a timely manner, if at all.\nWe were a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, and we are also an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act enacted in April 2012, each of which allows us to take advantage of exemptions from certain public company reporting requirements.\nThese exemptions include, but are not limited to, (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (2) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements, and (3) exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Although we ceased to be a smaller reporting company as of January 1, 2015, we could be an emerging growth company for up to five years after the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act. However, if certain events occur prior to the end of such five year period, including if we become a \"large accelerated filer,\" our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion or we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt in any three year period, we would cease to be an emerging growth company prior to the end of such five year period. We have taken advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in the filings we have made with the SEC and may elect to take advantage of other reduced burdens in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choice we make to reduce disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, being a public company makes it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. In the future, we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain this coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executives and members of our Board of Directors, particularly directors willing to serve on our audit committee.\nAny failure to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting could materially adversely affect us.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to include in our annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, at such time, if any, as we are neither a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d nor an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d our independent registered public accounting firm will have to attest to and report on management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of such internal control over financial reporting. Based upon the last evaluation conducted as of December 31, 2014, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of such date. While we have assessed our control environment and addressed previously identified control deficiencies, the policies, processes and procedures we have put in place since the Merger to remediate identified deficiencies have not been implemented for a sufficient period of time to enable us to properly test the effectiveness of the controls and determine them to be effective.\nWhile we believe that the policies, processes and procedures we put in place will be sufficient to render our internal controls over financial reporting effective, our initiatives may not prove successful and management may not be able to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Furthermore, even if management were to reach such a conclusion, if our independent registered public accounting firm is not satisfied with the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, or if the independent auditors interpret the requirements, rules or regulations differently than we do, then (if required in the future) they may decline to attest to management\u2019s assessment or may issue a report that is qualified. Any of these events could result in a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could negatively affect the price of our common stock.\nIn particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and (if required in future) our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404. Our compliance with Section 404 may require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts.\n***\nThe risks above do not necessarily comprise all of those associated with an investment in the Company.
