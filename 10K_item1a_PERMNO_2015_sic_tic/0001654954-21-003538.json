{"cik": "884650", "company": "INFINITE GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information provided in our reports, you should consider the following factors carefully in evaluating our business and us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or that are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general, such as competitive conditions, may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Industry\nSystem security risks, data protection breaches, cyberattacks, and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or IT services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation.\nWe sell cybersecurity services, third-party software as well as our internally developed software, Nodeware. As a result, we have been and will be a target of cyber-attacks designed to impede the performance of our products, penetrate our network security or the security of our cloud platform or our internal systems, or that of our customers, misappropriate proprietary information and/or cause interruptions to our services. For example, because Nodeware is a network vulnerability management tool, a successful cyber-attack on us may be perceived as a victory for the cyber attacker, thereby increasing the likelihood that we may be a target of more cyber-attacks, even absent financial motives. Further, if our systems are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error or misconduct, attackers could learn critical information about how our primary product operates to help protect our customers\u2019 IT infrastructures from cyber risk, thereby making our customers more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. In addition, if actual or perceived breaches of our network security occur, they could adversely affect the market perception of our Nodeware product, negatively affecting our reputation, and may expose us to the loss of our proprietary information or information belonging to our customers, investigations or litigation and possible liability, including injunctive relief and monetary damages. Such security breaches could also divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. In addition, such security breaches could impair our ability to operate our business and provide products to our customers. If this happens, our reputation could be harmed, our revenue could decline, and our business could suffer. We monitor our network continuously with our Nodeware product as well as other cybersecurity software.\nWe are not aware of or identified an incident leading to a breach of our internal or external facing systems. We have implemented several proactive policies and procedures to mitigate any internal incidents from outside forces. This includes deploying additional monitoring software, phishing training, creating an internal incident response team, and additional awareness through internal communications around typical attempts that outside forces use. While we have seen phishing attempts sent to certain email addresses, we have mitigated those through the aforementioned steps. Our internal security team has blocked the associated addresses and/or domains of the senders and has enhanced email security features to identify external emails. Overall, our internal security posture continues to evolve as the market evolves. We have a cyber insurance policy which will cover certain expenses related to an attack, such as certain business interruption costs associated with an incident.\nWe depend on prime contracts or subcontracts with the federal, state and local governments for a substantial portion of our sales, and our business would be seriously harmed if the government ceased doing business with us or our prime contractors or significantly decreased the amount of business it does with us or our prime contractors.\nWe derived approximately 70% of our sales in 2020 from contracts as either a prime contractor or a subcontractor from government contracts. We expect that we will continue to derive a substantial portion of our sales for the foreseeable future from work performed under government contracts, as we have in the past, and from marketing efforts focused on commercial enterprises. If we or our prime contractors were suspended or prohibited from contracting with federal, state or local governments, or if our reputation or relationship with the federal, state or local governments and commercial enterprises were impaired, or if any of the foregoing otherwise ceased doing business with us or our prime contractors or significantly decreased the amount of business it does with us or our prime contractors, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected.\nOur business could be adversely affected by changes in budgetary priorities of the federal, state and local governments.\nBecause we derive a significant portion of our sales from contracts with federal, state and local governments, we believe that the success and development of our business will continue to depend on our successful participation in their contract programs. Changes in federal, state and local government budgetary priorities could directly affect our financial performance. A significant decline in government expenditures, a shift of expenditures away from programs which call for the types of services that we provide or a change in government contracting policies, could cause U.S. Governmental agencies as well as state and local governments to reduce their expenditures under contracts, to exercise their right to terminate contracts at any time without penalty, not to exercise options to renew contracts or to delay or not originate new contracts. Any of those actions could seriously harm our business, prospects, financial condition or operating results. Moreover, although our contracts with governmental entities may contemplate that our services will be performed over a period of several years, government entities usually must approve funds for a given program each government fiscal year and may significantly reduce or eliminate funding for a program. Significant reductions in these appropriations could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additional factors that could have a serious adverse effect on our government contracting business include, but may not be limited to:\n\u25cf\nchanges in government programs or requirements;\n\u25cf\nbudgetary priorities limiting or delaying government spending generally, or by specific departments or agencies and changes in fiscal policies or available funding, including potential governmental shutdowns;\n\u25cf\nreductions in the government's use of technology solutions firms;\n\u25cf\na decrease in the number of contracts reserved for small businesses, or small business set asides, which could result in our inability to compete directly for these prime contracts; and\n\u25cf\ncurtailment of the government uses of IT or related professional services.\nRisks Related to our Business and Financial Condition\nOur results of operations may be negatively impacted by the coronavirus outbreak.\nIn December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus surfaced in China and the virus has now spread to other countries, including the United States and infections have been reported globally. The impacts of the outbreak are unknown and rapidly evolving.\nTo date, the outbreak has not had a material adverse impact on our operations. However, the future impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted and there is no assurance that the outbreak will not have a material adverse impact on our business, operations and the market for our securities. The extent of the impact, if any, will depend on future developments, including actions taken to contain the coronavirus. There can be no assurance that our personnel will not be impacted by these pandemic diseases and ultimately see our workforce productivity reduced or incur increased medical costs / insurance premiums as a result of these health risks.\nIn addition, a significant outbreak of coronavirus could result in a widespread global health crisis that could adversely affect global economies and financial markets resulting in an economic downturn.\nWe rely on one customer for a large portion of our revenues.\nWe depend on one customer for a large portion of our revenue. During 2020, sales to one customer, including sales under subcontracts, accounted for 61.2% of total sales and 38.8% of accounts receivable at December 31, 2020. The loss of this customer could have a significant impact on our revenues and harm our business and results of operations.\nWe are highly leveraged, which increases our operating deficit and makes it difficult for us to grow.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had current liabilities of approximately $3.1 million and long-term liabilities of $1.6 million and stockholders\u2019 deficiency of $3,105,770. We had a working capital deficit of approximately $2.1 million and a current ratio of .35. Working capital shortages may impair our business operations and growth strategy, and accordingly, our business, operations.\nIf we acquire businesses or business assets and do not successfully integrate the acquisitions, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may grow our business by acquiring or investing in companies and businesses and assets that we feel have synergy and will complement our business plan. As such, we periodically evaluate potential business combinations and investments in other companies and assets. We may be unable to profitably manage businesses and assets that we may acquire or invest in. We may fail to integrate these businesses and assets successfully without incurring substantial expenses, delays or other problems that could negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur investments in cybersecurity and other business initiatives may not be successful.\nWe have invested in and continue to invest in cybersecurity capabilities to add new products and services to address the needs of our clients, including our newly introduced product, Nodeware. Our investments may not be successful or increase our revenues. If we are not successful in creating value from our investments by increasing sales, our financial condition and prospects could be harmed.\nIf we fail to adequately manage the size of our business, it could have a severe negative impact on our financial results or stock price.\nOur management believes that to be successful we must appropriately manage the size of our business. This may mean reducing costs and overhead in certain economic periods, and selectively growing in periods of economic expansion. In addition, we will be required to implement operational, financial and management information procedures and controls that are efficient and appropriate for the size and scope of our operations. The management skills and systems currently in place may not be adequate and we may not be able to manage any significant reductions or growth effectively.\nWe may have difficulties in managing our growth.\nOur future growth depends, in part, on our ability to expand, train and manage our employee base and provide support to an expanded client base. We must also enhance and implement new operating and software systems to accommodate our growth and expansion of IT product and service offerings. If we cannot manage growth effectively, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial condition. In addition, acquisitions, investments and expansion involve substantial infrastructure costs and working capital. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to integrate acquisitions, if any, and expansions efficiently. Similarly, we cannot provide assurance that any investments or expansion will enhance our profitability. If we do not achieve sufficient sales growth to offset increased expenses associated with our expansion, our results will be adversely affected.\nWe depend on the continued services of our key personnel.\nOur future success depends, in part, on the continuing efforts of our senior executive officers. The loss of any of these key employees may materially adversely affect our business.\nOur future success depends on our ability to continue to retain and attract qualified employees.\nWe believe that our future success depends upon our ability to continue to train, retain, effectively manage and attract highly skilled technical, managerial, sales and marketing personnel. This includes skills for our new initiatives in cybersecurity. Employee turnover is generally high in the IT services industry. If our efforts in these areas are not successful, our costs may increase, our sales efforts may be hindered, and the quality of our client service may suffer. Although we invest significant resources in recruiting and retaining employees, there is often significant competition for certain personnel in the IT services industry. From time to time, we experience difficulties in locating enough highly qualified candidates in desired geographic locations, or with required specific expertise.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be adversely affected by the possible issuance of shares to third parties upon conversion of outstanding notes.\nWe have four convertible notes outstanding to third parties that are convertible into shares of common stock at prices ranging from $.05 to $.25 per share. If these notes were converted into common stock, the holders would receive approximately 5,025,000 shares of our common stock or approximately 14.7% of our common stock outstanding as of March 25, 2021.\nOur stock price is volatile and could be further affected by events not within our control.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile and will continue to be subject to volatility in the trading markets and other factors.\nThe closing market price for our common stock varied between a low of $.03 and a high of $.15 in 2020. This volatility may affect the price at which a stockholder could sell its shares of common stock, and the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Our stock price is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including variations in our quarterly operating results and announcement by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments.\nOur common stock is currently quoted on the Over The Counter (OTC) Bulletin Board. Because there is a limited public market for our common stock, a stockholder may not be able to sell shares when he or she wants. We cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common stock will ever develop.\nThere is limited trading in our common stock, and we cannot assure you that an active public market for our common stock will ever develop. The lack of an active public trading market means that a stockholder may not be able to sell shares of common stock when wanted, thereby increasing market risk. Until our common stock is listed on an exchange, we expect that the shares will continue to be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. However, an investor may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations regarding the common stock\u2019s market value. In addition, if we failed to meet the criteria set forth in SEC regulations, various requirements would be imposed by law on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. Consequently, such regulations may deter broker-dealers from recommending or selling our common stock, which may further affect the shares liquidity. Moreover, our ability to obtain future financing may be adversely affected by the consequences of our common stock trading on the OTC Bulletin Board.\nOur common stock may be considered a \u201cpenny stock\u201d and may be difficult to buy or sell.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has adopted regulations which generally define \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be an equity security that has a market or exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. The market price of our common stock is currently below $5.00 per share and therefore may be designated as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d according to SEC rules. This designation requires any broker or dealer selling these securities to disclose certain information concerning the transaction, obtain a written agreement from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities. These rules may restrict the ability of brokers or dealers to accept our share certificates into a customer account and may affect the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares.", "PERMNO": 79595, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "IMCI"}
