RISK FACTORS\nOur business and the sector within which we operate is influenced by significant risk and uncertainties. These risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks, and the trading prices of our common stock could decline by virtue of these risks. These risks should be read in conjunction with the other information in this report. This report, including Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements that may be materially affected by several risk factors, including those summarized below:\nFinancial Risks\nOur results of operations, cash flows and the value of our properties are highly dependent on the market prices of gold and silver and certain base metals and these prices can be volatile.\nThe profitability of our gold, silver, and base metal mining operations and the value of our mining properties are directly related to the market price of gold, silver, copper, lead, and zinc. The price of gold and silver may also have a significant influence on the market price of our common stock. The market price of gold and silver historically has fluctuated significantly and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include supply and demand fundamentals, global or national political or economic conditions, expectations with respect to the rate of inflation, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar and other currencies, interest rates, gold and silver sales and loans by central banks, forward sales by metal producers, accumulation and divestiture by exchange traded funds, and a number of other factors.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from the sale of gold, silver, and zinc, and to a lesser extent copper and lead, and our results of operations will fluctuate as the prices of these metals change. A period of significant and sustained lower metal prices would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. The volatility of mineral prices represents a substantial risk which no amount of planning or technical expertise can fully eliminate. In the event metal prices decline or remain low for prolonged periods of time, we might be unable to develop our existing operating or exploration properties, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial performance, and cash flows. An asset impairment charge may result from the occurrence of unexpected adverse events that impact our estimates of expected cash flows generated from our producing properties or the market value of our non-producing properties, including a material diminution in the price of metals.\nThe volatility in gold and silver prices is illustrated by the following table, which sets forth for each of the past five calendar years, the high, low, and average annual market prices in U.S. dollars per ounce of gold and silver and the price per tonne of base metals based on the daily London P.M. fix and London Metal Exchange:\nAs of February 23, 2021, gold and silver prices were $1,807 per ounce and $27.65 per ounce, respectively. Base metal prices per tonne were for copper $9,092, for lead $2,099, and zinc $2,847 on February 23, 2021.\nWe may not continue to be profitable.\nDuring the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we reported net income of $4.4 million, $5.8 million, and $9.3 million, respectively. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we reported net (loss) income from continuing operations of $(6.3) million, $5.5 million, and $11.9 million, respectively. We have accumulated retained earnings of $12.7 million as of December 31, 2020. Metal prices have a significant impact on our profit margin and there is no assurance that we will be profitable in the future. We have recently completed a separation of our former business into two separate companies, and our remaining assets may not generate sufficient cash flow to cover our operating, development, exploration, and other costs due to certain risk factors. Unexpected interruptions in our mining business may cause us to incur losses, or the revenue that we generate from production may not be sufficient to fund continuing operations including exploration and mine construction costs. Our failure to generate future profits may adversely affect the price of our common stock and shareholders may lose all or part of their investment.\nWe may require significant additional capital to fund our business plans.\nWe may be required to expend significant funds to determine if mineralized material and proven and probable mineral reserves exist at any of our non-producing properties to continue exploration, and if warranted, develop our existing properties and to identify and acquire additional properties to diversify our property portfolio. If we receive the necessary permits and make a positive development decision, we will require significant additional capital to bring the projects into production. We have spent, and may be required to continue to expend, significant amounts of capital for drilling, geological and geochemical analysis, assaying, feasibility studies, mine development, and mining and process equipment in connection with our exploration, development, and production activities.\nOur ability to obtain necessary funding for these purposes, in turn, depends upon a number of factors, including our historical and prospective results of operations, the status of the national and worldwide economy, the price of gold, silver and other valuable metals, the condition of the debt and equity markets, and the costs associated with extracting minerals. We may not be successful in generating or obtaining the required financing, or if we can obtain such financing, such financing may not be on terms that are favorable to us. Failure to obtain such additional financing could result in delay or indefinite postponement of further mining operations or exploration and construction and the possible partial or total loss of our interest in our properties.\nWe do not hedge our exposure to fluctuations in gold and silver prices and therefore may be subject to significant reductions in commodity prices.\nWe do not currently use hedging transactions with respect to any of our gold and silver production and we do not expect to do so in the future. Accordingly, we are fully exposed to price fluctuations if precious and base metal prices decline. While the use of hedging transactions limits the downside risk of price declines, their use also may limit future revenues from price increases. Hedging transactions also involve the risk that the counterparty may be unable to satisfy its obligations.\nCompetition in the mining industry is intense, and we have limited financial and personnel resources with which to compete.\nCompetition in the mining industry for desirable properties, investment capital and human capital is intense. Numerous companies headquartered in the United States, Canada, and elsewhere throughout the world compete for properties and human capital on a global basis. We are a small participant in the mining industry due to our limited financial and human capital resources. We presently operate with a limited number of human capital and we anticipate operating in the same manner going forward. We compete with other companies in our industry to hire qualified human capital when needed to successfully operate our mines and processing facility. We may be unable to attract the necessary investment capital or human capital to fully explore, and if warranted, develop our properties and be unable to acquire other desirable properties. We believe that competition for acquiring mineral properties, as well as the competition to attract and retain qualified human capital, will continue to be intense in the future.\nSince a significant amount of our expenses in Mexico are paid in Mexican pesos, we are subject to fluctuations in currency values that may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur revenue and external funding are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, certain mining, processing, maintenance and exploration costs are denominated in Mexican pesos. Therefore, our operations have in the past and will in the future be affected by fluctuations in the value of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar. The appreciation of the peso against the U.S. dollar increases expenses and the cost of purchasing capital assets in U.S. dollar terms in Mexico, which can adversely impact our operating results and cash flows. Conversely, depreciation of the Mexican peso decreases operating costs and capital asset purchases in U.S. dollar terms. The value of cash and cash equivalents, and other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies also fluctuate with changes in currency exchange rates.\nOur ability to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets is dependent on future cash flows and taxable income.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized; otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to realize the deferred tax assets could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws could limit our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2020, our net deferred tax assets were $0.3 million.\nOur accounting and other estimates may be imprecise.\nPreparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosure of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reporting periods. The more significant areas requiring the use of management assumptions and estimates relate to:\n\u25cf Mineral reserves, mineralized material, and other resources that are the basis for future income and cash flow estimates and units-of-production depreciation, depletion and amortization calculations;\n\u25cf Future ore grades, throughput and recoveries;\n\u25cf Future metals prices;\n\u25cf Future capital and operating costs;\n\u25cf Environmental, reclamation and closure obligations;\n\u25cf Permitting and other regulatory considerations;\n\u25cf Asset impairments;\n\u25cf Future foreign exchange rates, inflation rates and applicable tax rates; and\n\u25cf Deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nFuture estimates and actual results may differ materially from these estimates as a result of using different assumptions or conditions. For additional information, see Critical Accounting Estimates in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and the risk factors set forth contained below. \u201cEstimates of proven and probable reserves and mineralized material are uncertain and the volume and grade of ore actually recovered may vary from our estimates,\u201d and \u201cOur continuing reclamation obligations at our operations could require significant additional expenditures\u201d.\nOur continuing reclamation obligations at our operations could require significant additional expenditures.\nWe are responsible for the reclamation obligations related to disturbances located on all of our properties and have recorded a liability on our balance sheet to cover the estimated reclamation obligation. However, there is a risk that any reserve could be inadequate to cover the actual costs of reclamation when carried out. Continuing reclamation obligations will require a significant amount of capital. There is a risk that we will be unable to fund these additional obligations and further, that the regulatory authorities may increase reclamation requirements to such a degree that it would not be commercially reasonable to continue mining and exploration activities, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial performance and cash flows.\nOperational Risks\nOur production is primarily derived from a single operating unit and any interruptions or stoppages in our mining activities at that operating unit would adversely affect our revenue.\nWe are largely dependent on revenues from a single operating unit to fund our operations. Any interruption in our ability to mine this location, such as a labor strike, natural disaster, or loss of permits would negatively impact our ability to generate revenue following such interruption. Additionally, if we are unable to economically develop additional mines, we will eventually deplete the body of mineralized material and will no longer generate revenue sufficient to fund our operations. A decrease in, or cessation of, our mining operations at this operating unit would adversely affect our financial performance and may eventually cause us to cease operations.\nSince our current property portfolio is limited to one operating unit, our ability to remain profitable over the long-term will depend on our ability to expand the known deposits like Arista and Switchback and /or identify, explore, and develop additional properties in Mexico.\nGold and silver producers must continually replace reserves depleted by production to maintain production levels over the long-term and provide a return on invested capital. Depleted reserves can be replaced in several ways, including expanding known ore bodies, locating new deposits, or acquiring interests in reserves from third parties. Exploration is highly speculative in nature, capital intensive, involves many risks and is frequently unproductive. Our current or future exploration programs may not result in new mineralization. Even if significant mineralization is discovered, it will likely take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change.\nFrom time to time, we may acquire mineral interests from other parties. Such acquisitions are based on an analysis of a variety of factors including historical exploration results, estimates of and assumptions regarding the extent of mineralized material, and/or reserves, the timing of production from such reserves and cash and other operating costs. In addition, we may rely on data and reports prepared by third parties (including the ability to permit and compliance with existing regulations) which may contain information or data that we are unable to independently verify or confirm. All of these factors are uncertain and may have an impact on our ability to develop the minerals interests.\nAs a result of these uncertainties, our exploration programs and any acquisitions which we may pursue may not result in the expansion or replacement of our current production with new ore reserves or operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position.\nEstimates of proven and probable reserves and mineralized material are uncertain and the volume and grade of ore actually recovered may vary from our estimates.\nThe proven and probable reserves stated in this report represent the amount of gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc that we estimated, at December 31, 2020, could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Estimates of proven and probable reserves and mineralized material are subject to considerable uncertainty. Such estimates are, to a large extent, based on the prices of gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc as well as interpretations of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques. These prices and interpretations are subject to change. If we determine that certain of our estimated reserves or mineralized material have become uneconomic, we may be forced to reduce our estimates. Actual production from proven and probable reserves may be significantly less than we expect.\nAny material changes in mineral estimates and grades of mineralization may affect the economic viability of our current operations, our decision to place a new property into production and/or such property\u2019s return on capital. There can be no assurance that mineral recoveries in small scale laboratory tests will be duplicated in a large-scale on-site operation in a production environment. Extended declines in market prices for gold and/or silver may render portions of our mineralization estimates uneconomic and result in reduced reported mineralization or adversely affect the commercial viability of one or more of our properties. Any material reductions in estimates of mineralization, or of our ability to extract this mineralization, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nAdditionally, the term \u201cmineralized material\u201d as used in this report does not indicate proven and probable reserves as defined by Industry Guide 7 (\u201cGuide 7\u201d) promulgated by the SEC. Estimates of mineralized material are inherently imprecise and depend on geological interpretation and statistical inferences drawn from drilling and sampling that may prove to be unreliable or inaccurate. We cannot be certain that any part or parts of the mineralized material deposit will ever be confirmed or converted into Guide 7 compliant mineral reserves or that mineralized material can be economically or legally extracted.\nIf we are unable to achieve anticipated gold, silver, and base metal production levels, our financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe have been processing ore from the Arista and Mirador underground mines at the Aguila and Alta Gracia projects, respectively, based on estimates of mineralized material identified during exploration and in our Proven and Probable Reserve report. However, risks related to reserve estimates, metallurgy, and/or mining dilution are inherent when working with extractable minerals. Sales of gold, silver, and base metals that we realize from future mining activity will be less than anticipated if the mined material does not contain the concentration of gold and silver predicted by our geological exploration, studies and reports. If metal sales are less than anticipated, we may not be able to recover our investment in our properties and our operations may be adversely affected. Our inability to realize production based on quarterly or annual projections may also adversely affect the price of our common stock and our shareholders may lose part or all of their investment.\nRevenue from the sale of metal concentrate may be adversely affected by loss or damage during shipment and storage at our buyer\u2019s facilities.\nWe rely on third-party transportation companies to transport our metal concentrate to the buyer\u2019s facilities for processing and further refining. The terms of our sales contracts with the buyers require us to rely, in part, on assay results from samples of our metal concentrate that are obtained at the buyer\u2019s warehouse to determine the final sales value for our metals. Once the metal concentrate leaves our processing facility, we no longer have direct custody and control of these products. Theft, loss, road accidents, improper storage, fire, natural disasters, tampering or other unexpected events while in transit or at the buyer\u2019s location may lead to the loss of all or a portion of our metal concentrate products. Such losses may not be covered by insurance and may lead to a delay or interruption in our revenue and as a result, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nA significant delay or disruption in sales of concentrates or dor\u00e9 as a result of the unexpected disruption in services provided by smelters or refiners could have a material adverse effect on results of operations.\nWe rely on third party refiners and smelters to refine and process and, in some cases, purchase, the gold and silver dor\u00e9 and gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc concentrate produced from our mines. Access to refiners and smelters on economic terms is critical to our ability to sell our products to buyers and generate revenues. We periodically enter into agreements with refiners and smelters, some of which operate their refining or smelting facilities outside the United States, and we believe we currently have contractual arrangements with a sufficient number of refiners and smelters so that the loss of any one refiner or smelter would not significantly or materially impact our operations or our ability to generate revenues. Nevertheless, services provided by a refiner or smelter may be disrupted by operational issues, new or increased tariffs, duties or other cross-border trade barriers, the bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more refiners or smelters or the inability to agree on acceptable commercial or legal terms with a refiner or smelter. Such an event or events may disrupt an existing relationship with a refiner or smelter or result in the inability to create a contractual relationship with a refiner or smelter, which may leave us with limited, uneconomical or no access to refining or smelting services for short or long periods of time. Any such delay or loss of access may significantly impact our ability to sell dor\u00e9 and concentrate products. We cannot ensure that alternative refiners or smelters would be available or offer comparable terms if the need for them were to arise or that it would not experience delays or disruptions in sales that would materially and adversely affect results of operations.\nExploration and, if deemed feasible, development of mineral properties is inherently risky and could lead to unproductive properties and/or capital investments.\nOur long-term success depends on our ability to identify additional mineral deposits on our properties and any other properties that we may acquire and to develop of those deposits into commercially viable mining operations. Mineral exploration is highly speculative in nature, involves many risks and is frequently unproductive. These risks include unusual or unexpected geologic formations and the inability to obtain suitable or adequate machinery, equipment or labor. The success of exploration is determined in part by the following factors:\n\u25cf The identification of potential mineralization based on surface and drill analysis;\n\u25cf Availability of government-granted exploration and construction permits;\n\u25cf The quality of our management, geological and technical expertise; and\n\u25cf The capital available for exploration and development.\nSubstantial expenditures are required to establish proven and probable reserves through detailed drilling and analysis, to develop metallurgical processes to extract metal and to develop the mining and processing facilities and infrastructure at any site chosen for mining. Whether a mineral deposit will be commercially viable depends on a number of factors, which include, without limitation, the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade, metallurgy, rock competency and proximity to infrastructure like power, water and roads; metal prices, which fluctuate widely; and government regulations, including, without limitation, regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, importing and exporting of minerals, environmental protection and local and community support. We may invest significant capital and resources in exploration activities and abandon such investments if we are unable to identify commercially exploitable mineral reserves. The decision to abandon a project may have an adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and our ability to raise future financing.\nWe may acquire additional exploration, development and operating stage properties and our business may be negatively impacted if reserves are not located on acquired properties or if we are unable to successfully execute and/or integrate the acquisitions.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, acquire additional exploration, development and operating stage properties. There can be no assurance that reserves will be identified on any properties that we acquire. We may experience negative reactions from the financial markets if we successfully complete acquisitions of additional properties and reserves are not located on acquired properties.\nIn addition to the results of exploration, development and operating stage properties, if warranted, the success of any acquisition would depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf Identifying suitable candidates for acquisition and negotiating acceptable terms;\n\u25cf Obtaining approval from regulatory authorities and potentially our shareholders;\n\u25cf Implementing our standards, controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired business and addressing any pre-existing liabilities or claims involving the acquired business; and\n\u25cf To the extent the acquired operations are in a country in which we have not operated historically, understanding the regulations and challenges of operating in that new jurisdiction.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to conclude any acquisitions successfully, or that any acquisition will achieve the anticipated synergies or other positive results. Any material problems that we encounter in connection with such an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. These factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe rely on contractors to conduct a significant portion of our operations and construction projects.\nA significant portion of our operations and construction projects are currently conducted in whole or in part by contractors. As a result, our operations are subject to a number of risks, some of which are outside our control, including:\n\u25cf The difficulty and inherent delay in replacing a contractor and its operating equipment in the event that either party terminates the agreement;\n\u25cf Reduced control and oversight over those aspects of operations which are the responsibility of the contractor;\n\u25cf Failure of a contractor to perform under its agreement;\n\u25cf Interruption of operations and construction or increased costs in the event that a contractor ceases its business due to insolvency or other unforeseen events;\n\u25cf Injuries or fatalities on the job as a result of the failure to implement or follow adequate safety measures;\n\u25cf Failure of a contractor to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, to the extent it is responsible for such compliance; and\n\u25cf Problems of a contractor with managing its workforce, labor unrest or other related employment issues.\nIn addition, we may incur liability to third parties as a result of the actions of our contractors. The occurrence of one or more of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nIncreased operating and capital costs could adversely affect our results of operations.\nCosts at any particular mining location are subject to fluctuation due to a number of factors, such as variable ore grade, changing metallurgy and revisions to mine plans in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body, as well as the age and utilization rates for the mining and processing- related facilities and equipment. In addition, costs are affected by the price and availability of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel, concrete and mining and processing related equipment and facilities. Commodity costs are, at times, subject to volatile price movements, including increases that could make production at certain operations less profitable. Further, changes in laws and regulations can affect commodity prices, uses and transport. Reported costs may also be affected by changes in accounting standards. A material increase in costs could have a significant effect on our results of operation and operating cash flow.\nWe could have significant increases in capital and operating costs over the next several years in connection with the development of new projects in challenging jurisdictions and in the sustaining and/or expansion of existing mining and processing operations. Costs associated with capital expenditures may increase in the future as a result of factors beyond our control. Increased capital expenditures may have an adverse effect on the results of operation and cash flow generated from existing operations, as well as the economic returns anticipated from new projects.\nMining operations are subject to unique risks.\nThe exploration for minerals, mine construction and mining operations, especially in an underground environment, involve a high level of risk and are often affected by hazards outside of our control. Some of these risks include, but are not limited to, underground fires or floods, fall-of-ground accidents, seismic activity and unexpected geological formations or conditions including noxious fumes or gases. The occurrence of one or more of these events in connection with our exploration, mine construction, or production activities may result in the death of, or personal injury to, our employees, other personnel or third parties, the loss of mining equipment, damage to or destruction of mineral properties or production facilities, monetary losses, deferral or unanticipated fluctuations in production, environmental damage and potential legal liabilities, all of which may adversely affect our reputation, business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nContinuation of our mining operations is dependent on the availability of sufficient and affordable water supplies.\nOur mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. Our properties in Mexico are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. Continuous production and mine development is dependent on our ability to acquire and maintain water rights and claims and to defeat claims adverse to current water uses in legal proceedings. Although we believe that our operations currently has sufficient water rights and claims to cover its operating demands, we cannot predict the potential outcome of future legal proceedings relating to water rights, claims and uses. Water shortages may also result from weather or environmental and climate impacts out of our control. Shortages in water supply could result in production and processing interruptions. In addition, the scarcity of water in certain regions could result in increased costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water to conduct our operations. The loss of some or all water rights, in whole or in part, or ongoing shortages of water to which we have rights or significantly higher costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water (or the failure to procure sufficient quantities of water) could result in our inability to maintain production at current or expected levels, require us to curtail or shut down mining production and prevent us from pursuing expansion or development opportunities. Laws and regulations may be introduced in some jurisdictions in which we operate which could also limit access to sufficient water resources, thus adversely affecting our operations.\nThe nature of mineral exploration and production activities involves a high degree of risk and the possibility of uninsured losses.\nExploration for and the production of minerals is highly speculative and involves greater risk than many other businesses. Many exploration programs do not result in the discovery of mineralization, and any mineralization discovered may not be of sufficient quantity or quality to be profitably mined. Our operations are, and any future mining operations or construction we may conduct will be, subject to all of the operating hazards and risks normally incident to exploring for and mining of mineral properties, such as, but not limited to:\n\u25cf Uneconomic mineralized material;\n\u25cf Fluctuation in production costs that make mining uneconomic;\n\u25cf Labor disputes;\n\u25cf Unanticipated variations in grade and other geologic problems;\n\u25cf Environmental hazards;\n\u25cf Water conditions;\n\u25cf Difficult surface or underground conditions;\n\u25cf Industrial accidents;\n\u25cf Metallurgical and other processing problems;\n\u25cf Mechanical and equipment performance problems;\n\u25cf Failure of pit walls, dams, declines, drifts and shafts;\n\u25cf Unusual or unexpected rock formations;\n\u25cf Personal injury, fire, flooding, cave-ins and landslides; and\n\u25cf Decrease in the value of mineralized material due to lower gold, silver and metal prices.\nAny of these risks can materially and adversely affect, among other things, the development of properties, production quantities and rates, costs and expenditures, potential revenues and targeted production dates. We currently have limited insurance to guard against some of these risks. If we determine that capitalized costs associated with any of our mineral interests are not likely to be recovered, we would incur a write down of our investment in these interests. All of these factors may result in losses in relation to amounts spent which are not recoverable or result in additional expenses.\nWe do not, or cannot, insure against all of the risks to which we may be subject in our operations and development.\nWhile we currently maintain insurance for general commercial liability claims and the physical assets at our Aguila and Alta Gracia projects, we do not maintain insurance to cover all of the potential risks associated with our operations. We might be subject to liability for environmental, pollution or other hazards associated with mineral exploration and mine construction, for which insurance may not be available, which may exceed the limits of our insurance coverage, or which we may elect not to insure against because of premium costs or other reasons. We may also not be insured against all interruptions to our operations. Losses from these or other events may cause us to incur significant costs which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to fund activities on our properties. A significant loss could force us to reduce or suspend our operations and development.\nRegulatory Risk Factors\nOur operations are subject to ongoing permitting requirements which could result in the delay, suspension or termination of our operations.\nOur operations, including our ongoing exploration drilling programs and production, require ongoing permits from governmental and local authorities. If we cannot obtain or maintain the necessary permits or if there is a delay in receiving future permits, our timetable and business plan will be adversely affected.\nOur operating properties located in Mexico are subject to changes in political or economic conditions and regulations in that country.\nThe risks with respect to operating in Mexico or other developing countries include, but are not limited to: nationalization of properties, military repression, extreme fluctuations in currency exchange rates, increased security risks, labor instability or militancy, mineral title irregularities and high rates of inflation. In addition, changes in mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude in Mexico may adversely affect our business. We may be affected in varying degrees by government regulation with respect to restrictions on production, price controls, export controls, income taxes, expropriation of property, maintenance of claims, environmental legislation, land use, land claims of local people, opposition from non-governmental organizations, labor legislation, water use and mine safety. The effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted and may adversely impact our operations.\nOur ability to develop our Mexican properties is subject to the rights of the Ejido (agrarian cooperatives) who use or own the surface for agricultural purposes.\nOur ability to mine minerals is subject to maintaining satisfactory arrangements and relationships with the Ejido for access and surface disturbances. Ejidos are groups of local inhabitants who were granted rights to conduct agricultural activities on the property. We must negotiate and maintain a satisfactory arrangement with these residents in order to disturb or discontinue their rights to farm. While we have successfully negotiated and signed such agreements related to the Aguila and Alta Gracia projects, our inability to maintain these agreements or consummate similar agreements for new projects could impair or impede our ability to successfully explore, develop and mine the properties, which in turn could adversely affect our future cash flow.\nOur activities are subject to significant environmental regulations, which could raise the cost of doing business or adversely affect our ability to develop our properties.\nOur mining operations in Mexico are subject to environmental regulation by SEMARNAT. Regulations governing advancement of new projects or significant changes to existing projects require an environmental impact statement, known in Mexico as a MIA. We may also be required to submit proof of local community support for a project to obtain final approval. If an environmental impact statement is adverse or if we cannot obtain community support, our ability to explore and develop our properties could be adversely affected. Significant environmental legislation exists in Mexico,\nincluding fines and penalties for spills, release of emissions into the air, and other environmental damage, which fines or penalties could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nTitle to mineral properties can be uncertain and in the event of a dispute regarding title to our Mexican properties, it will likely be necessary for us to resolve the dispute in Mexico, where we would be faced with unfamiliar laws and procedures.\nOur ability to explore and operate our properties depends on the validity of our title to that property. Our concessions in Mexico are subject to continuing government regulation and failure to adhere to such regulations will result in termination of the concession. Uncertainties inherent in mineral properties relate to such things as the sufficiency of mineral discovery, proper posting and marking of boundaries, assessment work and possible conflicts with other claims not determinable from public record. There may be valid challenges to the title to our properties which, if successful, could impair development and/or operations. The resolution of disputes in foreign countries can be costly and time consuming. In a foreign country we face the additional burden of understanding unfamiliar laws and procedures. We may not be entitled to a jury trial, as we might be in the U.S. Further, to litigate in any foreign country, we would be faced with the necessity of hiring lawyers and other professionals who are familiar with the foreign laws. For these reasons, we may incur unforeseen costs if we are forced to resolve a dispute in Mexico or any other foreign country.\nRisks Relating to the Fortitude Gold Corporation Spin-Off\nThe separation of our business into two separate public companies could have adverse impacts on our results of operation and future prospects.\nThe separation may result in various adverse impacts on our businesses and the trading price of our common stock including, without limitation, the risk that the separation does not achieve the expected benefits for the parties, changes to our senior management, reduced cash flow and the availability of capital, the risk of potential adverse tax consequences for our company and shareholders, and risks, difficulties, and uncertainties that may result from the separation of businesses that were previously co-mingled including necessary ongoing relationships.\nThe spin-off of Fortitude Gold Corporation could result in significant tax liability to our company and its shareholders.\nWhile our analysis of the tax treatment of the transaction was based on certain representations as to factual matters from our company and the facts as stated in the Separation Agreement, the other ancillary agreements, the prospectus for the spin-off and a number of other documents, we did not obtain an opinion that the Fortitude Spin-Off would qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss to our company and our shareholders under any federal or state law. Our analysis is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or the courts, and we cannot assure shareholders that the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position. If the spin-off were determined not to qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss, U.S. holders could be subject to tax. In this case, each U.S. holder who received the Fortitude Gold Corporation stock in the spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of Fortitude Gold Corporation common stock received, which would generally result in (i) a taxable dividend to the U.S. holder to the extent of that U.S. holder\u2019s pro rata share of the Company\u2019s current and accumulated earnings and profits; (ii) a reduction in the U.S. holder\u2019s basis (but not below zero) in the Company\u2019s common stock to the extent the amount received exceeds the shareholder\u2019s share of the Company\u2019s earnings and profits; and (iii) a taxable gain from the exchange of the Company\u2019s common stock to the extent the amount received exceeds the sum of the U.S. holder\u2019s share of the Company\u2019s earnings and profits and the U.S. holder\u2019s basis in its common stock.\nIf the spin-off were determined not to qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss, then the Company would recognize a gain in an amount up to the fair market value of the Fortitude Gold Corporation stock held by the Company immediately before the spin-off.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile and as a result shareholders could lose part or all of their investment.\nIn addition to other risk factors identified and due to volatility associated with equity securities in general, the value of a shareholder\u2019s investment could decline due to the impact of numerous factors upon the market price of our common stock, including:\n\u25cf Changes in the worldwide price for the metals we mine;\n\u25cf Adverse results from our exploration, development, or production efforts;\n\u25cf Producing at rates lower than those targeted;\n\u25cf Political and regulatory risks;\n\u25cf Weather conditions, including unusually heavy rains;\n\u25cf Failure to meet our revenue or profit goals or operating budget;\n\u25cf Decline in demand for our common stock;\n\u25cf Downward revisions in securities analysts\u2019 estimates or changes in general market conditions;\n\u25cf Technological innovations by competitors or in competing technologies;\n\u25cf Investor perception of our industry or our prospects;\n\u25cf Lawsuits;\n\u25cf Economic impact from spread of disease;\n\u25cf Actions by government or central banks; and\n\u25cf General economic trends.\nStock markets in general have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of individual securities have been highly volatile. These fluctuations are often unrelated to operating performance and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As a result, shareholders may be unable to sell their shares at a desired price.\nPast payments of dividends on our common stock are not a guaranty of future payments of dividends.\nIn 2010, we began paying cash dividends to the holders of our common stock. However, our ability to continue to pay dividends in the future will depend on a number of factors, including, free cash flow, mine construction requirements and strategies, other acquisition and/or construction projects, spot metal prices, taxation, government-imposed royalties and general market conditions. Further, a portion of our cash flow is expected to be retained to finance our operations and explorations and development of mineral properties. Any material change in our operations may affect future dividends which may be modified or canceled at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Any decrease in our monthly dividend would likely have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to the Continued Listing Criteria of the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE American\u201d), and our failure to satisfy these criteria may result in delisting of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NYSE American. In order to maintain that listing, we must maintain certain share price and other criteria, including maintaining a minimum amount of shareholders\u2019 equity and a minimum number of public shareholders. In addition to objective standards, the NYSE American may delist the securities of any issuer if, in its opinion, the issuer\u2019s financial condition and/or operating results appear unsatisfactory; if it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the security has become so reduced as to make continued listing on the NYSE American inadvisable; if the issuer sells or disposes of principal operating assets or ceases to be an operating company; if an issuer fails to comply with the NYSE American\u2019s listing requirements; if an issuer\u2019s common stock sells at what the NYSE American considers a \u201clow selling price\u201d and the issuer fails to correct this via a reverse split of shares after notification by the NYSE American; or if any other event occurs or any condition exists which makes continued listing on the NYSE American, in its opinion, inadvisable.\nIf the NYSE American delists our common stock, investors may face material adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, a lack of trading market for our securities, reduced liquidity, decreased analyst coverage of our securities, and an inability for us to obtain additional financing to fund our operations.\nIssuances of our stock in the future could dilute existing shareholders and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe have the authority to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock, 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, and to issue options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, in some cases without shareholder approval. As of February 23, 2021, there were 74,439,205 shares of common stock outstanding. Future issuances of our securities could be at prices substantially below the price paid for our common stock by our current shareholders. We can issue blocks of our common stock in amounts up to 20% of the then-outstanding shares without further shareholder approval. Because we have issued less common stock than many of our larger peers, the issuance of a significant amount of our common stock may have a disproportionately large impact on our share price compared to larger companies.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe are dependent upon information technology systems, which are subject to disruption, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation and integration.\nWe are dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of our operations. Our information technology systems are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity incidents, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. We have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to information technology systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into our operations. If we are unable to successfully implement system upgrades or modifications, we may have to rely on manual reporting processes and controls over financial reporting that have not been planned, designed or tested. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to the system upgrades and modifications, but system upgrades and modification failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could, if not successfully implemented, adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nOur business is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, a breach or violation of which could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, loss of licenses or permits and reputational harm.\nWe operate in certain jurisdictions that have experienced some degree of governmental and private sector corruption, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with certain local customs and practices. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. Our Code of Ethics and other corporate governance mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, which often carry substantial penalties. However, there can be no assurance that our internal control\npolicies and procedures will always protect us from recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts committed by our affiliates, employees, contractors, or agents. As such, our corporate policies and processes may not prevent all potential breaches of law or other governance practices. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, litigation, loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations or cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nWe depend upon a limited number of personnel and the loss of any of these individuals could adversely affect our business.\nDue to the relatively limited number of personnel that we employ, we are dependent on certain key individuals to run our business. These individuals include our executive officers and other key employees. If any of these individuals were to die, become disabled or leave our company, we would be forced to identify and retain individuals to replace them. There is no assurance that we can find suitable individuals to replace them or to add to our employee base if that becomes necessary. We have no life insurance on any individual, and we may be unable to hire a suitable replacement on favorable terms should that become necessary.\nOur activities may continue to be adversely affected by unforeseeable and unquantifiable health risks, such as COVID-19, whether those effects are local, nationwide or global.\nThe novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and has spread globally, including throughout the United States and Mexico. In response, many jurisdictions, including in the United States, some of its political subdivisions and Mexico have instituted restrictions on travel, public gatherings, and certain business operations. These restrictions have significantly disrupted economic activity in both the world, national and local economies and have caused volatility in capital markets. Our operations at the Aguila project in Oaxaca were temporarily suspended and our cash flow suffered during 2020 as a result. The various government restrictions arising due to the virus have curtailed the travel of our executives, which might adversely affect our operations on a long-term basis. The effects of the continued outbreak of COVID-19 or other viruses and related government responses could include extended disruptions to supply chains and capital markets, reduced labor availability and productivity and a prolonged reduction in economic activity. These effects could have a variety of adverse impacts on us, including reduced demand for our products, impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets and impairment of our ability to develop and construct new mines and operate existing projects and to access funds from financial institutions and capital markets. In particular, these effects could disrupt or delay mining at our operating projects, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flow and financial condition. Due to circumstances beyond our control, including the availability and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine, we are unable to determine the long-term impact that the COVID-19 outbreak will have on operations.", "PERMNO": 12049, "SIC": 1040, "TIC": "GORO"}
