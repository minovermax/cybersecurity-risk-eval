{"cik": "923120", "company": "GREENBRIER COMPANIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-10-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the risks outlined in this annual report under the heading \u201cForward-Looking Statements,\u201d as well as other comments included herein regarding risks and uncertainties, the following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our company. Our business, financial condition or financial results could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. In addition, new risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect us.\nThe cyclical nature of our business, economic downturns or a rising interest rate environment can result in lower demand for our products and services and reduced revenue.\nOur business is cyclical. Overall economic conditions and the purchasing practices of buyers have a significant effect upon our business due to the impact on demand for our products and services. As a result, during downturns, we could operate with a lower level of backlog and may slow down or halt production at some or all of our facilities. Economic conditions that result in higher interest rates increase the cost of new leasing arrangements, which could cause some of our leasing customers to lease fewer of our railcars or demand shorter lease terms. An economic downturn or increase in interest rates may reduce demand for our products and services, resulting in lower sales volumes, lower prices, lower lease utilization rates and decreased profits.\nInterest rates remain close to historically low levels. Higher interest rates could increase the cost of, or potentially deter, new leasing arrangements with our customers, reduce our ability to syndicate railcars under lease to financial institutions, or impact the sales price we may receive on such syndications, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA change in our product mix due to shifts in demand or fluctuations in commodity and energy prices could have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nWe manufacture and, through GBW, repair a variety of railcars. The demand for specific types of these railcars and mix of repair and refurbishment work varies from time to time. In addition, fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, including crude oil and gas prices, could negatively impact the activities of our customers resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on the demand for our products and services. These shifts in demand could affect our results of operations and could have an adverse effect on our profitability. Demand for railcars that are used to transport crude oil and other energy related products is dependent on the demand for these commodities. Prices for oil and gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of, and demand for, oil and gas, market uncertainty and a variety of other economic factors that are beyond our control.\nA decline in performance of the rail freight industry would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future success depends in part upon the performance of the rail freight industry, which in large part depends on the health of the economy. If railcar loadings, railcar and railcar components replacement rates or refurbishment rates or industry demand for our railcar products weaken or otherwise do not materialize, if railcar transportation becomes more efficient from an increase in velocity or a decrease in dwell times, if there is a negative impact due to technological advances or if the rail freight industry becomes oversupplied, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur backlog is not necessarily indicative of the level of our future revenues.\nOur manufacturing backlog represents future production for which we have written orders from our customers in various periods, and estimated potential revenue attributable to those orders. Some of this backlog is subject to\nThe Greenbrier Companies 2017 Annual Report\ncertain conditions, including potential adjustment to prices due to changes in prevailing market prices, or due to lower prices for new orders accepted by us from other customers for similar cars on similar terms and conditions during relevant time periods. Our reported backlog may not be converted to revenue in any particular period and some of our contracts permit cancellations with limited compensation that would not replace lost revenue or margins. In addition, some customers may attempt to cancel or modify a contract even if the contract does not allow for such cancellation or modification, and we may not be able to recover all revenue or earnings lost due to a breach of contract. The likelihood of attempted cancellations or modifications of contracts generally increases during periods of market weakness. Actual revenue from such contracts may not equal our anticipated revenues based on our backlog, and therefore, our backlog is not necessarily indicative of the level of our future revenues.\nWe derive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, the loss of or reduction of business from one or more of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nA significant portion of our revenue is generated from a few major customers. Although we have some long-term contractual relationships with our major customers, we cannot be assured that our customers will continue to purchase or lease our products or services or that they will continue to do so at historical levels. A reduction in the purchasing or leasing of our products or a termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe could be unable to lease railcars at satisfactory rates, remarket leased railcars on favorable terms upon lease termination or realize the expected residual values due to changes in scrap prices upon lease termination, which could reduce our revenue and decrease our overall return or effect our ability to sell leased assets in the future.\nThe profitability of our railcar leasing business depends on our ability to lease railcars to our customers at satisfactory rates, and to re-market, sell or scrap railcars we own or manage upon the expiration of existing lease terms. The total rental payments we receive under our operating leases do not fully amortize the acquisition costs of the leased equipment, which exposes us to risks associated with remarketing the railcars and the risk of not realizing the expected residual values. Our ability to lease or remarket leased railcars profitably is dependent upon several factors, including, but not limited to, market and industry conditions, cost of and demand for competing used or newer models, costs associated with the refurbishment of the railcars, market demand or governmental mandate for refurbishment, assumptions related to expected residual values and interest rates. A downturn in the industries in which our lessees operate and decreased demand for railcars could also increase our exposure to re-marketing risk because lessees may demand shorter lease terms, requiring us to re-market leased railcars more frequently. Furthermore, the resale market for previously leased railcars has a limited number of potential buyers. From August 31, 2014 to August 31, 2017, the percentage of railcars in the fleet on lease has declined from approximately 98% to 92%. Our inability to lease, re-market or sell leased railcars on favorable terms could result in reduced revenues and margins or net gain on disposition of equipment and decrease our overall returns and affect our ability to syndicate railcars to investors.\nRisks related to our operations outside of the U.S. could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur current operations outside of the U.S. and any future expansion of our international operations are subject to the risks associated with foreign and cross-border business transactions and activities. Political, legal, trade, financial market or economic changes or instability could limit or curtail our foreign business activities and operations. Some foreign countries in which we operate or may operate have regulatory authorities that regulate railroad safety, railcar design and railcar component part design, performance and manufacturing. If we fail to obtain and maintain certifications of our railcars and railcar parts within the various foreign countries where we operate or may operate, we may be unable to market and sell our railcars in those countries. In addition, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other trade barriers, more stringent rules relating to labor or the environment, adverse tax consequences and currency and price exchange controls could limit operations and make the manufacture and distribution of our products difficult. Sovereign risk exists related to international governments that include, but may not be limited to, governments stopping payments or\nThe Greenbrier Companies 2017 Annual Report\nrepudiating, renegotiating or nullifying their contracts, nationalizing private businesses and assets or altering banking, foreign exchange or tax regulations. The uncertainty of the legal environment or geo-political risks in these and other areas could limit our ability to enforce our rights effectively. We may experience longer customer payment cycles, difficulty in collecting accounts receivable or an inability to effectively protect intellectual property. Because we have operations outside the U.S., we could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. The failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial penalties and fines. Any international expansion or acquisition that we undertake could amplify these risks related to operating outside of the U.S. In addition, in 2015, we began to establish a presence in the GCC region and Latin America and are exploring market opportunities in Eastern Europe and other emerging markets. Our development of customer relationships in these areas may expose us to uncertainties arising from local business practices, judicial processes, cultural considerations and international political and trade tensions and our limited knowledge of foreign markets or our inability to protect our interests.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with our global business, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows may be negatively impacted.\nChanges impacting international trade and corporate tax provisions related to the global sales and production of our products may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe own, lease, operate or have invested in joint ventures or entities which have manufacturing facilities in Mexico, Brazil and Europe. Our business benefits from free trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and we also rely on various U.S. corporate tax provisions related to international commerce as we build, market and sell our products globally. NAFTA and future import taxes are under scrutiny by the current U.S. administration. On August 16, 2017 the U.S. Trade Representative opened the renegotiation of NAFTA with the governments of Canada and Mexico. Negotiations continue and the U.S. administration has periodically indicated a willingness to exercise its right to declare its intent to withdraw from NAFTA after a six month notice period. Any changes in trade treaties, corporate tax policy, import taxes and foreign policies could adversely and significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe rail freight industry could become oversupplied and the use of railcars as a significant mode of transporting freight could decline, become more efficient over time, experience a shift in types of modal transportation, and/or certain railcar types could become obsolete.\nThe rail freight industry could become oversupplied which could have a significant impact on the pricing, lease rates or demand for new railcars. In addition, if railcar transportation becomes more efficient from an increase in velocity or a decrease in idle times, especially if coupled with lower freight volumes, some of which may be permanent due to a reduction in coal volumes, this could significantly reduce the demand for our products and could adversely affect our results of operations. As the freight transportation markets we serve continue to evolve and become more efficient or are disrupted through technological developments, the use of railcars may decline in favor of other more economic modes of transportation. Features and functionality specific to certain railcar types could result in those railcars becoming obsolete as customer requirements for freight delivery change. Our operations may be adversely impacted by changes in the preferred method used by customers to ship their products or changes in demand for particular products. The industries in which our customers operate are driven by dynamic market forces and trends, which are in turn influenced by economic and political factors. Demand for our railcars may be significantly affected by changes in the markets in which our customers operate. A significant reduction in customer demand for transportation or manufacture of a particular product or change in the preferred method of transportation used by customers to ship their products could result in reduced demand for railcars and the economic obsolescence of our railcars, including those leased by our customers.\nThe Greenbrier Companies 2017 Annual Report\nWe face aggressive competition by a concentrated group of competitors and a number of factors may influence our performance. If we are unable to compete successfully, our market share, margin and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe face aggressive competition by a concentrated group of competitors in all geographic markets and in each area of our business. In addition, other companies may attempt to enter markets in which we compete. Some of these competitors are owned or financially supported by foreign countries or sovereign wealth funds, and may potentially sell products and services below cost, or otherwise to compete unfairly, in order to gain market share. These markets are intensely competitive and we expect it to remain so in the foreseeable future. Competitive factors, including introduction of competitive products, new entrants into certain of our markets, price pressures, limited customer base and the relative competitiveness of our manufacturing facilities and products affect our ability to compete effectively. In addition, new technologies or the introduction of new railcars or other product offerings by our competitors could render our products obsolete or less competitive. If we do not compete successfully, our market share, margin and results of operation may be adversely affected.\nWe may pursue strategic opportunities, including new joint ventures, acquisitions and new business endeavors that involve inherent risks, any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits and we could have difficulty integrating the operations of companies that we acquire or joint ventures we enter into, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully identify suitable joint venture, acquisition and new business endeavors to invest in or complete potential transactions on acceptable terms. Our identification of suitable joint venture opportunities, acquisition candidates and new business endeavors involve risks inherent in assessing the values, strengths, weaknesses, risks and profitability of these opportunities. Our failure to identify suitable joint ventures, acquisition opportunities and new business endeavors may restrict our ability to grow our business. If we are successful in pursuing such opportunities, we may be required to expend significant funds or incur additional debt, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and limit our ability to obtain financing for working capital or other purposes and we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures.\nThe success of our acquisition and joint venture strategies depends upon our ability to successfully complete acquisitions, to enter into joint ventures and to integrate any businesses that we acquire into our existing business. The integration of acquired business operations could disrupt our business by causing unforeseen operating difficulties, diverting management\u2019s attention from day-to-day operations and requiring significant financial resources that would otherwise be used for the ongoing development of our business. The difficulties of integration could be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically dispersed organizations, integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures. Each of these circumstances could be more likely to occur or be more severe in consequence in the case of an acquisition or joint venture involving a business that is outside of our core areas of expertise. In addition, we could be unable to retain key employees or customers of the combined businesses. We could face integration issues including those related to operations, internal controls, information systems and operational functions of the acquired companies and we also could fail to realize cost efficiencies or synergies that we anticipated when selecting our acquisition candidates and joint ventures. Any of these items could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we or our joint ventures fail to complete capital expenditure projects on time and within budget, or if these projects, once completed, fail to operate as anticipated, such failure could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time-to-time, we, or our joint ventures, undertake strategic capital projects in order to enhance, expand and/or upgrade facilities and operational capabilities. Our ability, and our joint ventures\u2019 ability, to complete these projects on time and within budget, and for us to realize the anticipated increased revenues or otherwise realize acceptable returns on these investments or other strategic capital projects that may be undertaken is subject to a number of risks. Many of these risks are beyond our control, including a variety of market, operational, permitting, and labor related factors. In addition, the cost to implement any given strategic capital project\nThe Greenbrier Companies 2017 Annual Report\nultimately may prove to be greater than originally anticipated. If we, or our joint ventures, are not able to achieve the anticipated results from the implementation of any of these strategic capital projects, or if unanticipated implementation costs are incurred, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nA failure to design or manufacture products or technologies or to achieve timely certification or market acceptance of new products or technologies could have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nWe continue to introduce new railcar product innovations and technologies, and we periodically accept orders prior to receipt of railcar certification or proof of ability to manufacture a quality product that meets customer standards. We could be unable to successfully design or manufacture these new railcar product innovations or technologies. Our inability to develop and manufacture such new product innovations or technologies in a timely fashion and profitable manner, obtain timely certification, or achieve market acceptance, or the existence of quality problems in our new products, could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations and subject us to penalties, cancellation of orders and/or other damages.\nOur relationships with our joint venture and alliance partners could be unsuccessful, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe have entered into several joint venture agreements and other alliances or investments with other companies to increase our sourcing alternatives, reduce costs, to produce new railcars or components and repair and retrofit railcars. We may seek to expand our relationships or enter into new agreements with other companies. If our joint venture or alliance partners are unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or if these relationships are otherwise not successful in the future, our manufacturing and other costs could increase, we could encounter production disruptions, growth opportunities could fail to materialize, or we could be required to fund such joint venture or alliances in amounts significantly greater than initially anticipated, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nIf any of our joint ventures generate significant losses, including future potential intangible asset or goodwill impairment charges, it could adversely affect our results of operations or cause our investment to be impaired.\nWe have potential exposure to environmental liabilities, which could increase costs or have an adverse effect on results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive national, state, foreign, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, air emissions, water discharge, solid waste and hazardous substances handling and disposal and employee health and safety. These laws and regulations are complex and frequently change. We could incur unexpected costs, penalties and other civil and criminal liability if we, or in certain circumstances others, fail to comply with environmental laws or permits issued pursuant to those laws. We also could incur costs or liabilities related to off-site waste disposal or remediating soil or groundwater contamination at our properties, including as set forth below. In addition, future environmental laws and regulations may require significant capital expenditures or changes to our operations, or may impose liability on us in the future for actions that complied with then applicable laws and regulations when the action was taken.\nOur Portland, Oregon manufacturing facility is located adjacent to the Willamette River. In December 2000, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classified portions of the Willamette River bed, known as the Portland Harbor, including the portion fronting our manufacturing facility, as a federal \u201cNational Priority List\u201d or \u201cSuperfund\u201d site due to sediment contamination (the Portland Harbor Site). We, along with more than 140 other parties, have received a \u201cGeneral Notice\u201d of potential liability from the EPA relating to the Portland Harbor Site. The letter advised us that we may be liable for the costs of investigation and remediation (which liability may be joint and several with other potentially responsible parties) as well as for natural resource damages resulting from releases of hazardous substances to the site. Ten private and public entities, including us (the Lower Willamette\nThe Greenbrier Companies 2017 Annual Report\nGroup or LWG), signed an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) to perform a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) of the Portland Harbor Site under EPA oversight, and several additional entities have not signed such consent, but nevertheless contributed money to the effort. The EPA-mandated RI/FS was produced by the LWG and cost over $110 million during a 17-year period. We bore a percentage of the total costs incurred by the LWG in connection with the investigation. We cannot provide assurance that some or all of any such outlay will be recoverable from other responsible parties. The LWG requested in August 2017 that the AOC be terminated since EPA issued its ROD for the Portland Harbor Site on January 6, 2017.\nSeparate from the process described above which focused on the type of remediation to be performed at the Portland Harbor Site and the schedule for such remediation, 83 parties, including the State of Oregon and the federal government, have entered into a non-judicial mediation process to try to allocate costs associated with remediation of the Portland Harbor Site. Approximately 110 additional parties have signed tolling agreements related to such allocations. On April 23, 2009, we and the other AOC signatories filed suit against 69 other parties due to a possible limitations period for some such claims; Arkema Inc. et al v. A & C Foundry Products, Inc. et al, U.S. District Court, District of Oregon, Case #3:09-cv-453-PK. All but 12 of these parties elected to sign tolling agreements and be dismissed without prejudice, and the case was stayed by the court, pending the EPA\u2019s ROD, which was issued by the EPA on January 6, 2017. The continuing status of the stay has not yet been determined by the court. The allocation process is continuing in parallel with the process to define the remediation steps.\nThe EPA\u2019s January 6, 2017 ROD selects a remedy that the EPA estimates will take 13 years of active remediation, followed by 30 years of monitoring, with an estimated undiscounted cost of $1.7 billion. The EPA expects its cost estimates to be within a range of -30% to +50%. However, the EPA has acknowledged that more data needs to be collected before a remedy can be designed and that costs may change significantly based upon that additional data. The EPA\u2019s ROD identifies 13 Sediment Decision Units. One of the units, RM9W, includes the nearshore area of the river sediments offshore of our Portland, Oregon manufacturing facility as well as upstream and downstream of the facility. The ROD does not break down total remediation costs by unit.\nOn January 30, 2017 the Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakama Nation sued 33 parties including our company as well as the United States and the State of Oregon for costs it incurred in assessing alleged natural resource damages to the Columbia River from contaminants deposited in Portland Harbor. Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation v. Air Liquide America Corp., et. al., United States Court for the District of Oregon Case No. 3i17-CV-00164-SB. We, along with many of the other defendants, have moved to dismiss the case. That motion is pending. The complaint does not specify the amount of damages the Plaintiff will seek.\nThe ROD does not assign responsibility for the costs of clean-up, allocate such costs among the potentially responsible parties, nor define precise boundaries for the cleanup. Responsibility for funding and implementing the EPA\u2019s selected cleanup option will be determined at a later date.\nBased on the investigation to date, we believe that we did not contribute in any material way to contamination in the river sediments or the damage of natural resources in the Portland Harbor Site and that the damage in the area of the Portland Harbor Site adjacent to our property precedes our ownership of the Portland, Oregon manufacturing facility. Because these environmental investigations are still underway, sufficient information is currently not available to determine our liability, if any, for the cost of any required remediation or restoration of the Portland Harbor Site or to estimate a range of potential loss. Based on the results of the pending investigations and future assessments of natural resource damages, we may be required to incur costs associated with additional phases of investigation or remedial action, and may be liable for damages to natural resources. In addition, we may be required to perform periodic maintenance dredging in order to continue to launch vessels from our launch ways in Portland, Oregon, on the Willamette River, and the river\u2019s classification as a Superfund site could result in some limitations on future dredging and launch activities. Any of these matters could adversely affect our business and Consolidated Financial Statements, or the value of our Portland property.\nWe have entered into a Voluntary Cleanup Agreement with the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) in which we agreed to conduct an investigation of whether, and to what extent, past or present operations at the Portland property may have released hazardous substances into the environment. We have also signed an\nThe Greenbrier Companies 2017 Annual Report\nOrder on Consent with the DEQ to finalize the investigation of potential onsite sources of contamination that may have a release pathway to the Willamette River. Interim precautionary measures are also required in the order and we are currently discussing with the DEQ potential remedial actions which may be required. We could incur significant expenses for remediation and we cannot provide assurance that some or all of any such outlay will be recoverable from other responsible parties.\nThe timing of our asset sales and related revenue recognition could cause significant differences in our quarterly results and liquidity.\nWe may build railcars or marine barges in anticipation of a customer order, or that are leased to a customer and ultimately planned to be sold to a third party. The difference in timing of production and the ultimate sale subjects our company to operational and market risks. In addition, we periodically sell railcars from our own lease fleet and the timing and volume of such sales is difficult to predict. As a result, comparisons of our manufacturing revenue, deliveries, quarterly net gain on disposition of equipment, income and liquidity between quarterly periods within one year and between comparable periods in different years may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of our future performance.\nWe depend on our senior management team and other key employees, and significant attrition within our management team or unsuccessful succession planning for members of our senior management team and other key employees who are at or nearing retirement age, could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate senior management and other key employees. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, competitors\u2019 hiring practices, cost reduction activities, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. Competition for qualified personnel can be very intense. We must continue to recruit, retain and motivate senior management and other key employees sufficient to maintain our current business and support our future projects and growth objectives. We are vulnerable to attrition among our current senior management team and other key employees. A loss of any such personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany members of our senior management team and other key employees are at or nearing retirement age. If we are unsuccessful in our succession planning efforts, the continuity of our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nChanges in the credit markets and the financial services industry could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nThe credit markets and the financial services industry may experience volatility which can result in tighter availability of credit on more restrictive terms and limit our ability to sell railcar assets. Our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if our ability to borrow money to finance operations, obtain credit from trade creditors, offer leasing products to our customers or sell railcar assets were to be impaired. In addition, scarcity of capital could also adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability to purchase or pay for products from us or our suppliers\u2019 ability to provide us with product, either of which could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nVolatility in the global financial markets may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nDuring periods of volatility in the global financial markets, certain of our customers could delay or otherwise reduce their purchases of railcars and other products and services. If volatile conditions in the global credit markets impact our customers\u2019 access to credit, product order volumes may decrease or customers may default on payments owed to us.\nThe Greenbrier Companies 2017 Annual Report\nLikewise, if our suppliers face challenges obtaining credit, or otherwise operating their businesses, the supply of materials we purchase from them to manufacture our products may be interrupted. Any of these conditions or events could result in reductions in our revenues, increased price competition, or increased operating costs, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) held a non-binding advisory referendum in which voters voted for the UK to exit the EU (Brexit). Brexit has caused volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations, including the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. Continuing political uncertainties related to Brexit may create further uncertainty in European and worldwide markets, which may cause our customers or potential customers to delay or reduce spending on our products or services, and may limit our suppliers\u2019 access to credit. Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur actual results may differ significantly from our announced expectations.\nFrom time to time, we have released, and may continue to release guidance estimates in our quarterly and annual earnings releases, quarterly and annual earnings conference calls, or otherwise, regarding our future performance that represents our management\u2019s estimates as of the date of release. Although we believe that any such guidance or estimates would provide investors and analysts with a better understanding of management\u2019s expectations for the future and could be useful to our shareholders and potential shareholders, such guidance or estimates would consist of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements. Guidance and estimates are necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance or estimates may not materialize or may vary significantly from actual results. Our actual results may not always be in line with or exceed any guidance or estimates we may provide, especially in times of economic uncertainty. If our financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or estimates or the expectations of investors or research analysts, or if we reduce our guidance or estimates for future period, the trading volume or market price of our common stock may decline. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged not to unduly rely upon any guidance or estimates in making an investment decision regarding our common stock.\nWe rely on limited suppliers for certain components and services needed in our production. If we are not able to procure specialty components or services on commercially reasonable terms or on a timely basis, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur manufacturing operations depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of materials, components and services in acceptable quantities and quality from our suppliers. In 2017, the top ten suppliers for all inventory purchases accounted for approximately 53% of total purchases. Amsted Rail Company, Inc. accounted for 22% of total inventory purchases in 2017. No other suppliers accounted for more than 10% of total inventory purchases. Certain components of our products, particularly specialized components like castings, bolsters, trucks, wheels and axels, and certain services, such as lining capabilities, are currently only available from a limited number of suppliers. Increases in the number of railcars manufactured could increase the demand for such components and services and strong demand may cause industry-wide shortages if suppliers are in the process of ramping up production or reach capacity production. Our dependence on a limited number of suppliers involves risks, including limited control over pricing, availability and delivery schedules. If any one or more of our suppliers cease to provide us with sufficient quantities of our components or services in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us, or cease to provide services or manufacture components of acceptable quality, we could incur disruptions or be limited in our production of our products and we could have to seek alternative sources for these components or services. We could also incur delays while we attempt to locate and engage alternative qualified suppliers and we might be unable to engage acceptable alternative suppliers on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, we are increasing the number of components and services we manufacture or provide ourselves, directly or through joint ventures. If we are not successful at manufacturing such components or providing such services or have production problems after transitioning to self-produced supplies, we may not be able to replace such components or services from third party suppliers in a timely manner. Any such disruption in\nThe Greenbrier Companies 2017 Annual Report\nour supply of specialized components and services or increased costs of those components or services could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations.\nTrain derailments or other accidents or claims could subject us to legal claims that adversely impact our business, financial condition and our results of operations.\nWe provide a number of services which include the manufacture and supply of new railcars, wheels, components and parts and the lease and repair of railcars for our customers that transport a variety of commodities, including tank railcars that transport hazardous materials such as crude oil, ethanol and other products. We could be subject to various legal claims, including claims for negligence, personal injury, physical damage and product or service liability, or in some cases strict liability, as well as potential penalties and liability under environmental laws and regulations, in the event of a derailment or other accident involving railcars, including tank railcars. Additionally, the severity of injury or property damage arising from an incident may influence the causation responsibility analysis exposing us to potentially greater liability. If we become subject to any such claims and are unable successfully to resolve them or have inadequate insurance for such claims, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nChanges in or failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements applicable to the industries in which we operate may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations and the industry we serve, including our customers, are subject to extensive regulation by governmental, regulatory and industry authorities and by federal, state, local and foreign agencies. These organizations establish rules and regulations for the railcar industry, including construction specifications and standards for the design and manufacture of railcars; mechanical, maintenance and related standards; and railroad safety. New regulatory rulings and regulations from these entities could impact our financial results, demand for our products and the economic value of our assets. In addition, if we fail to comply with the requirements and regulations of these entities, we could face sanctions and penalties that could negatively affect our financial results.\nThe risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to compliance with these laws and regulations are an inherent part of our business. Despite our intention to comply with these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so at all times and compliance may prove to be more costly and limiting than we currently anticipate and compliance requirements could increase in future years. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and may become more stringent over time, which could impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory changes, along with prevailing market conditions, could materially affect new tank railcar manufacturing and retrofitting activities industry-wide, including negative impacts to customer demand for our products and services. Additional laws and regulations have been proposed or adopted that will potentially have a significant impact on railroad operations, including the implementation of \u201cpositive train control\u201d (PTC) requirements. PTC is a collision avoidance technology intended to override engineer controlled locomotives and stop certain types of train accidents. While certain of these legal and regulatory changes could result in increased levels of repair or refurbishment work for GBW and/or new tank car manufacturing activity, if we are unable to manage to adapt our business successfully to changing regulations, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nCompliance with health care legislation and increases in the cost of providing health care plans to our employees may adversely affect our business.\nIn the U.S., the cost of providing health care plans to a company\u2019s employees has increased at annual rates in excess of inflation. Continued significant annual increases in the cost of providing employee health coverage may adversely affect our business and results of operations. It remains unclear whether changes will be made to applicable health care laws.\nThe Greenbrier Companies 2017 Annual Report\nAn adverse outcome in any pending or future litigation could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nWe are a defendant in several pending cases in various jurisdictions. If we are unsuccessful in resolving these claims, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, future claims that may arise relating to any pending or new matters, whether brought against us or initiated by us against third parties, could distract management\u2019s attention from business operations and increase our legal and related costs, which could also negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nRisks related to potential misconduct by employees may adversely impact us.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with our policies or regulatory standards and requirements, which could subject us to regulatory sanctions and materially harm our business. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses, including risks associated with whistleblower complaints and litigation. There can be no assurance that we will succeed in preventing misconduct by employees in the future. In addition, the investigation of alleged misconduct disrupts our operations and may be costly. Any such events in the future may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nShortages of skilled labor could adversely affect our operations.\nWe depend on skilled labor in the manufacture of railcars and marine barges, repair, refurbishment, retrofitting and maintenance of railcars and provision of wheel services and supply of parts. Some of our facilities are located in areas where demand for skilled laborers often exceeds supply. Shortages of some types of skilled laborers such as welders and machine operators could restrict our ability to maintain or increase production rates, lead to production inefficiencies and increase our labor costs.\nSome of our employees belong to labor unions and strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations.\nWe are a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions at some of our operations. Disputes with regard to the terms and conditions of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions in the future could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers. We cannot be assured that our relations with our workforce will remain positive. Union organizers are actively working to organize employees at some of our other facilities. If our workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown, or other employees were to become unionized or the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated, or if union representation is implemented at such sites and we are unable to agree with the union on reasonable employment terms, including wages, benefits, and work rules, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and incur higher ongoing labor costs. In addition, we could face higher labor costs in the future as a result of severance or other charges associated with lay-offs, shutdowns or reductions in the size and scope of our operations or due to the difficulties of restarting our operations that have been temporarily suspended.\nOur stock price has been volatile and may continue to experience large fluctuations.\nThe price of our common stock has experienced rapid and severe price fluctuations. Our stock price ranged from a low of $28.95 per share to a high of $51.25 per share for the year ended August 31, 2017 and $19.89 per share to a high of $42.04 per share for the year ended August 31, 2016. The price for our common stock is likely to\nThe Greenbrier Companies 2017 Annual Report\ncontinue to be volatile and subject to price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including the factors discussed elsewhere in these risk factors and the following:\n\u2022\nquarter-to-quarter variations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nthe depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;\n\u2022\nshortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and investors; including the level of our backlog and number of orders received during the period;\n\u2022\nchanges in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our future performance;\n\u2022\nshareholder activism;\n\u2022\ndissemination of false or misleading statements through the use of social and other media to discredit us, disparage our products or to harm our reputation;\n\u2022\nany developments that materially impact investors\u2019 or customers\u2019 perceptions of our business prospects;\n\u2022\ndilution resulting from our sale of additional shares of common stock or from the conversion of convertible notes;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulation;\n\u2022\nsignificant railcar industry announcements or developments;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new products or technologies by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our or our competitors\u2019 quarterly or annual financial results;\n\u2022\nthe general health and outlook of our industry\n\u2022\ngeneral financial and other market conditions; and\n\u2022\ndomestic and international economic conditions.\nIn addition, public stock markets have experienced, and may in the future experience, extreme price and trading volume volatility. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons frequently unrelated to, or that disproportionately impact, the operating performance of these companies and may adversely affect the price of our common stock. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future.\nA material decline in the price of our common stock may result in the assertion of certain claims against us, and/or the commencement of inquiries and/or investigations against us. A prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock, a reduction in our ability to raise capital, and the inability of investors to obtain a favorable selling price for their shares. Any reduction in our ability to raise equity capital in the future may force us to reallocate funds from other planned uses and could have a significant negative effect on our business plans and operations.\nFollowing periods of volatility in the market price of their stock, historically many companies have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we became involved in securities class action litigation in the future, it could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management\u2019s attention and our resources and could harm our stock price, business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur product and service warranties could expose us to potentially significant claims.\nWe offer our customers limited warranties for many of our products and services. Accordingly, we may be subject to significant warranty claims in the future, such as multiple claims based on one defect repeated throughout our production or servicing processes or claims for which the cost of repairing the defective part is highly disproportionate to the original cost of the part. These types of warranty claims could result in costly product recalls, customers seeking monetary damages, significant repair costs and damage to our reputation.\nIf warranty claims attributable to actions of third party component manufacturers are not recoverable from such parties due to their poor financial condition or other reasons, we could be liable for warranty claims and other risks for using these materials on our products.\nThe Greenbrier Companies 2017 Annual Report\nMany of our products are sold to third parties who may misuse, improperly install or improperly or inadequately maintain or repair such products thereby potentially exposing us to claims that could increase our costs and weaken our financial condition.\nThe products we manufacture are designed to work optimally when properly operated, installed, repaired, maintained and used to transport the intended cargo. When this does not occur, we may be subjected to claims or litigation associated with product damage, injuries or property damage that could increase our costs and weaken our financial condition.\nOur financial performance and market value could cause future write-downs of goodwill or intangibles in future periods.\nWe are required to perform an annual impairment review of goodwill and indefinite lived assets which could result in an impairment charge if it is determined that the carrying value of the asset is in excess of the fair value. We perform a goodwill impairment test annually during our third quarter. Goodwill is also tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that a potential impairment exists.\nWhen we have continued underperforming operations or changes in circumstances, such as a decline in the market price of our common stock, changes in demand or in the numerous variables associated with the judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the appropriate valuation of goodwill indicate the carrying amount of certain indefinite lived assets may not be recoverable, the assets are evaluated for impairment. Among other things, our assumptions used in the valuation of goodwill include growth of revenue and margins and increased cash flows over time. If actual operating results were to differ from these assumptions, it may result in an impairment of goodwill. As of August 31, 2017, we had $43.3 million of goodwill in our Wheels & Parts segment, $25.3 million in our Manufacturing segment and GBW had $41.5 million of goodwill. Impairment charges to our or GBW\u2019s goodwill or our indefinite lived assets would impact our results of operations. Future write-downs of goodwill and intangibles could affect certain of the financial covenants under debt instruments and could restrict our financial flexibility. In the event of goodwill impairment, we may have to test other assets for impairment.\nWe have indebtedness, which could have negative consequences to our business or results of operations.\nAs of August 31, 2017, our total consolidated indebtedness was approximately $597.6 million (excluding $30.8 million of debt discount and $8.6 million of debt issuance costs). As of August 31, 2017, approximately $188.3 million (excluding $0.8 million of debt issuance costs) of our consolidated indebtedness was secured. Our indebtedness consists of convertible notes, a senior secured revolving credit facility and term loans. Our level of indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness and the notes. As a result of our debt and debt service obligations, we face increased risks regarding, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to borrow additional amounts or refinance existing indebtedness in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, investments, stock repurchases, execution of our growth strategy, or other purposes may be limited or such financing may be more costly;\n\u2022\nour availability of cash flow to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions or other strategic initiatives and other general corporate purposes because a portion of our cash flow is needed to pay principal and interest on our debt;\n\u2022\nour vulnerability to competitive pressures and to general adverse economic or industry conditions, including fluctuations in market interest rates or a downturn in our business;\n\u2022\nour being at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that have greater financial resources than us or more flexible capital structures than us;\n\u2022\nour ability to satisfy our financial obligations related to our consolidated indebtedness;\n\u2022\nour additional exposure to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expense in the event of an increase in interest rates;\nThe Greenbrier Companies 2017 Annual Report\n\u2022\nour restrictions under the restrictive covenants in our North American senior secured credit facility, our secured term loan, our other credit agreements, and any of the agreements governing our future indebtedness adversely restricting our financial and operating flexibility and subjecting us to other risks; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility we may suffer a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition if we are unable to service our debt or obtain additional financing, as needed.\nDespite our current indebtedness levels and the restrictive covenants set forth in the agreements governing our indebtedness, if we, our subsidiaries and our joint ventures are in compliance with the covenants, we, our subsidiaries and our joint ventures may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, and other obligations and liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness. This could increase the risks associated with our indebtedness. As of August 31, 2017, after giving effect to issued but undrawn letters of credit, we had approximately $268.1 million of availability under our North American senior secured credit facility (based on our borrowing base as of such date) and approximately $70.8 million of availability under our European and Mexican joint venture senior secured credit facilities.\nWe may need to raise additional capital to operate our business and achieve our business objectives, which could result in dilution to investors.\nWe require substantial working capital to fund our business. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership held by our stockholders will be reduced and these equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock. We evaluate opportunities to access the capital markets taking into account our financial condition and other relevant considerations. Additional financing may not be available when needed, on terms favorable to us or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to develop or enhance our business, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe conversion of our outstanding convertible notes would result in substantial dilution to our current stockholders.\nThe conversion of some or all of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders, including holders who have previously converted their notes. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon the conversion of the notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the notes may encourage short selling by market participants, because the conversion of the notes could depress the price of our common stock.\nWe are a holding company with no independent operations. Our ability to meet our obligations depends upon the performance of our subsidiaries and our joint ventures and their ability to make distributions to us.\nAs a holding company, we are dependent on the earnings and cash flows of, and dividends, distributions, loans or advances from, our subsidiaries and joint ventures to generate the funds necessary to meet certain of our obligations including the payment of principal, of premium, if any, and interest on debt obligations. Any payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law and monetary transfer restrictions in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. In addition, many of our subsidiaries and our joint ventures are parties to credit facilities that contain restrictions on the timing and amount of any payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances that our subsidiaries may make to us. Under certain circumstances, some or all of our subsidiaries may be prohibited from making any such payments.\nThe Greenbrier Companies 2017 Annual Report\nOur governing documents, the indentures governing our 2024 Convertible Notes and 2018 Convertible Notes, and Oregon law contain certain provisions that could prevent or make more difficult an attempt to acquire us.\nOur Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, as currently in effect, contain certain provisions that may have anti-takeover effects, including:\n\u2022\na classified Board of Directors, with each class containing as nearly as possible one-third of the total number of members of the Board of Directors and the members of each class serving for staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\na vote of at least 55% of our voting securities to amend, repeal or adopt an inconsistent provision of certain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation;\n\u2022\nno less than 120 days\u2019 advance notice with respect to nominations of directors or other matters to be voted on by stockholders other than by or at the direction of the Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nremoval of directors only for cause;\n\u2022\nthe calling of special meetings of stockholders only by the president, a majority of the Board of Directors or the holders of not less than 25% of all votes entitled to be cast on the matters to be considered at such meeting;\n\u2022\nthe issuance of preferred stock by our board without further action by the shareholders; and\n\u2022\nthe availability under the Articles of Series A participating preferred stock that may be issuable.\nThe provisions discussed above could have anti-takeover effects because they may delay, defer or prevent an unsolicited acquisition proposal that some, or a majority, of our stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which stockholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the then-prevailing market price.\nThe Oregon Control Share Act and business combination law could limit parties who acquire a significant amount of voting shares from exercising control over us for specific periods of time. These acts could lengthen the period for a proxy contest or for a stockholder to vote their shares to elect the majority of our Board and change management. Additionally, the indentures governing our 2024 Convertible Notes and 2018 Convertible Notes provide for the acceleration, at the lenders option, of all outstanding principal and interest owed on the notes upon a change of control of our company. The rights afforded to our creditors under these indentures could increase the cost of any potential acquisition of our company and have a resulting chilling effect on interest in acquiring our company.\nThese restrictions and provisions could have the effect of dissuading other stockholders or third parties from contesting director elections or attempting certain transactions with us, including, without limitation, acquisitions, which could cause investors to view our securities as less attractive investments and reduce the market price of our common stock and the notes.\nPayments of cash dividends on our common stock may be made only at the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be restricted by Oregon law.\nAny decision to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our operating results, strategic plans, capital requirements, financial condition, provisions of our borrowing arrangements and other factors our Board of Directors considers relevant. Furthermore, Oregon law imposes restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. Accordingly, we may not be able to continue to pay dividends in any given amount in the future, or at all.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could lead to increased costs and lower profitability.\nOutside of the U.S., we currently conduct business in Mexico, Poland, other European countries, Brazil and Saudi Arabia, and our non-U.S. businesses conduct their operations in local currencies and other regional currencies. We also source materials worldwide. Fluctuations in exchange rates may affect demand for our products in foreign markets or our cost competitiveness and may adversely affect our profitability. Although we attempt to mitigate a portion of our exposure to changes in currency rates through currency rate hedge contracts\nThe Greenbrier Companies 2017 Annual Report\nand other activities, these efforts cannot fully eliminate the risks associated with the foreign currencies. In addition, some of our borrowings are in foreign currency, giving rise to risk from fluctuations in exchange rates. A material or adverse change in exchange rates could result in significant deterioration of profits or in losses for us.\nFluctuations in the availability and price of energy, freight transportation, steel and other raw materials, and our fixed price contracts could have an adverse effect on our ability to manufacture and sell our products on a cost effective basis and could adversely affect our margins and revenue.\nA significant portion of our business depends upon the adequate supply of steel, components and other raw materials at competitive prices and a small number of suppliers provide a substantial amount of our requirements. The cost of steel and all other materials used in the production of our railcars represents more than half of our direct manufacturing costs per railcar and in the production of our marine barges represents more than 30% of our direct manufacturing costs per marine barge.\nOur businesses also depend upon an adequate supply of energy at competitive prices. When the price of energy increases, it adversely impacts our operating costs and could have an adverse effect upon our ability to conduct our businesses on a cost-effective basis. We cannot be assured that we will continue to have access to supplies of energy or necessary components for manufacturing railcars and marine barges. Our ability to meet demand for our products could be adversely affected by the loss of access to any of these supplies, the inability to arrange alternative access to any materials, or suppliers limiting allocation of materials to us.\nIn some instances, we have fixed price contracts which anticipate material price increases and surcharges, or contracts that contain actual or formulaic pass-through of material price increases and surcharges. However, if the price of steel or other raw materials were to fluctuate in excess of anticipated increases on which we have based our fixed price contracts, or if we were unable to adjust our selling prices or have adequate protection in our contracts against changes in material prices, or if we are unable to reduce operating costs to offset any price increases, our margins would be adversely affected. The loss of suppliers or their inability to meet our price, quality, quantity and delivery requirements could have an adverse effect on our ability to manufacture and sell our products on a cost-effective basis.\nDecreases in the price of scrap adversely impact our Wheels & Parts and GBW Joint Venture margins and revenue and the residual value and future depreciation of our leased assets. A portion of our Wheels & Parts and GBW Joint Venture businesses involve scrapping steel parts and the resulting revenue from such scrap steel increases our margins and revenues. When the price of scrap steel declines, our revenues and margins in such business therefore decrease.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.\nOur business employs systems and websites that allow for the storage and transmission of proprietary or confidential information regarding our customers, employees, job applicants and other parties, including financial information, intellectual property and personal identification information. Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information, expose us to liability and harm our reputation and business. The steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks may not be successful. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent current or rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our customers, or others who have entrusted us with information. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts or consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, or other technological developments may result in the technology and security measures used by us to protect transaction or other data being breached or compromised. In addition, data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breach by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships. Any compromise or breach of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, legal and financial exposure, negative impacts on our customers\u2019 willingness\nThe Greenbrier Companies 2017 Annual Report\nto transact business with us and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.\nUpdates or changes to our information technology systems may result in problems that could negatively impact our business.\nWe have information technology systems, comprising hardware, network, software, people, processes and other infrastructure that are important to the operation of our businesses. We continue to evaluate and implement upgrades and changes to information technology systems that support substantially all of our operating and financial functions. We could experience problems in connection with such implementations, including compatibility issues, training requirements, higher than expected implementation costs and other integration challenges and delays. A significant problem with an implementation, integration with other systems or ongoing management and operation of our systems could negatively impact our business by disrupting operations. Such a problem could also have an adverse effect on our ability to generate and interpret accurate management and financial reports and other information on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial reporting system and internal controls and adversely affect our ability to manage our business.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property and prevent its improper use by third parties or if third parties assert that our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights, our ability to compete in the market may be harmed, and our business and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nThe protection of our intellectual property is important to our business. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, patents and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property. However, these protections might be inadequate. Our pending or future trademark, copyright and patent applications might not be approved or, if allowed, might not be sufficiently broad. If our intellectual property rights are not adequately protected we may not be able to commercialize our technologies, products or services and our competitors could commercialize our technologies, which could result in a decrease in our sales and market share and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Conversely, third parties might assert that our products, services, or other business activities infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. Infringement and other intellectual property claims and proceedings brought against us, whether successful or not, could result in substantial costs and harm our reputation. Such claims and proceedings can also distract and divert our management and key personnel from other tasks important to the success of our business. In addition, intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to cease selling or using products that incorporate the asserted intellectual property, which would adversely affect our revenues, or cause us to pay substantial damages for past use of the asserted intellectual property or to pay substantial fees to obtain a license from the holder of the asserted intellectual property, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. In the event of an adverse determination in an intellectual property suit or proceeding, or our failure to license essential technology or redesign our products so as not to infringe third party intellectual property rights, our sales could be harmed and our costs could increase, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be liable for physical damage, business interruption or product liability claims that exceed our insurance coverage.\nThe nature of our business subjects us to physical damage, business interruption and product liability claims, especially in connection with the repair and manufacture of products that carry hazardous or volatile materials. Although we maintain liability insurance coverage at commercially reasonable levels compared to similarly-sized heavy equipment manufacturers, an unusually large physical damage, business interruption or product liability claim or a series of claims based on a failure repeated throughout our production process could exceed our insurance coverage or result in damage to our reputation which could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Greenbrier Companies 2017 Annual Report\nWe could be unable to procure adequate insurance on a cost-effective basis in the future.\nThe ability to insure our businesses, facilities and rail assets is an important aspect of our ability to manage risk. As there are only limited providers of this insurance to the railcar industry, there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available on a cost-effective basis in the future. In addition, we cannot assure that our insurance carriers will be able to pay current or future claims.\nChanges in accounting standards or inaccurate estimates or assumptions in the application of accounting policies could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported value of our assets or liabilities and financial results and are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards (such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, and our independent registered public accounting firm) may amend or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, resulting in the revision of prior period financial statements. Changes in accounting standards can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.\nFires, natural disasters, severe weather conditions or public health crises could disrupt our business and result in loss of revenue or higher expenses.\nAny serious disruption at any of our facilities due to fire, hurricane, earthquake, flood, other severe weather events or any other natural disaster, or an epidemic or other public health crisis, or a panic reaction to a perceived health risk, could impair our ability to use our facilities and have a material adverse impact on our revenues and increase our costs and expenses. If there is a natural disaster or other serious disruption at any of our facilities, particularly at any of our Mexican facilities, it could impair our ability to adequately supply our customers, cause a significant disruption to our operations, cause us to incur significant costs to relocate or reestablish these functions and negatively impact our operating results. While we insure against certain business interruption risks, such insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses incurred as a result of natural or other disasters.\nUnusual weather conditions may reduce demand for our wheel-related parts and repair services.\nPerforming railcar wheel repair and replacing railcar wheels represents a portion of our business. Seasonal fluctuations in weather conditions may lead to greater variation in our quarterly operating results as unusually mild weather conditions will generally lead to lower demand for our wheel-related products and services. In addition, unusually mild weather conditions throughout the year may reduce overall demand for our wheel-related products and repair services. If occurring for prolonged periods, such weather could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nBusiness, regulatory, and legal developments regarding climate change may affect the demand for our products or the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs.\nScientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as greenhouse gases (GHGs) including carbon dioxide and methane, may be contributing to warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climate changes. Legislation and new rules to regulate emission of GHGs have been introduced in numerous state legislatures, the U.S. Congress, and by the EPA. Some of these proposals would require industries to meet stringent new standards that may require substantial reductions in carbon emissions. While we cannot assess the direct impact of these or other potential regulations, we recognize that new climate change\nThe Greenbrier Companies 2017 Annual Report\nprotocols could affect the demand for our products and/or affect the price of materials, input factors and manufactured components which could impact our margins. Potential opportunities could include greater demand for certain types of railcars, while potential challenges could include decreased demand for certain types of railcars or other products and higher energy costs. Other adverse consequences of climate change could include an increased frequency of severe weather events and rising sea levels that could affect operations at our manufacturing facilities, the price of insuring company assets, or other unforeseen disruptions of our operations, systems, property or equipment.\nRepercussions from terrorist activities or armed conflict could harm our business.\nTerrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts, and other armed conflict involving the U.S. or its interests abroad may adversely affect the U.S. and global economies, potentially preventing us from meeting our financial and other obligations. In particular, the negative impacts of these events may affect the industries in which we operate. This could result in delays in or cancellations of the purchase of our products or shortages in raw materials, parts, or components. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our financial condition and profitability and we may take tax positions that the Internal Revenue Service or other tax authorities may contest.\nWe are subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Changes in estimates of projected future operating results, loss of deductibility of items, recapture of prior deductions (including related to interest on convertible notes), our ability to utilize tax net operating losses in the future or changes in assumptions regarding our ability to generate future taxable income could result in significant increases to our tax expense and liabilities that could adversely affect our financial condition and profitability.\nWe have in the past and may in the future take tax positions that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or other tax authorities may contest. We are required by an IRS regulation to disclose particular tax positions to the IRS as part of our tax returns for that year and future years. If the IRS or other tax authorities successfully contests a tax position that we take, we may be required to pay additional taxes, interest or fines that may adversely affect our results of operation and financial position.\nSome of our customers place orders for our products in reliance on their ability to utilize tax benefits or tax credits such as accelerated depreciation.\nThere is no assurance that tax authorities will reauthorize, modify, or otherwise not allow the expiration of such tax benefits, tax credits, or reimbursement policies, and in cases where such subsidies and policies are materially modified to reduce the available benefit, credit, or reimbursement or are otherwise allowed to expire, the demand for our products could decrease, thereby creating the potential for a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term shareholder value although we cannot guarantee this will occur and this program may be suspended or terminated at any time.\nThe Board of Directors has authorized our company to repurchase our common stock through a share repurchase program. Our share repurchase program may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Although the share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term shareholder value, we cannot provide assurance that this will occur.\nThe Greenbrier Companies 2017 Annual Report\nOur business and operations could be negatively affected if we become subject to shareholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of our business strategy and impact our stock price.\nShareholder activism, which could take many forms and arise in a variety of situations, has been increasing in publicly traded companies recently. Shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s and our Board of Directors\u2019 attention and resources from our business. Additionally, such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, we may be required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters. Our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any shareholder activism.\nThe Greenbrier Companies 2017 Annual Report", "PERMNO": 80719, "SIC": 3743, "TIC": "GBX"}
