{"cik": "1610950", "company": "Syneos Health, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. In evaluating our company, you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below together with the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The occurrence of any of the following risks may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf we do not generate a large number of new business awards, or if new business awards are delayed, terminated, reduced in scope, or fail to go to contract, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to generate new business awards from new and existing customers and maintain existing customer contracts. Our inability to generate new business awards on a timely basis and subsequently enter into contracts for such awards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThere is risk of cancelability in both the clinical and commercial businesses. The time between when a clinical study is awarded and when it goes to contract is typically several months, and prior to a new business award going to contract, our customer can cancel the award without notice. Once an award goes to contract, the majority of our customers can terminate the contract with little notice, in many cases 30 days or less. Our contracts may be delayed or terminated by our customers or reduced in scope for a variety of reasons beyond our control, including but not limited to:\n\u2022decisions to forego or terminate a particular trial;\n\u2022budgetary limits or changing priorities;\n\u2022actions by regulatory authorities;\n\u2022production problems resulting in shortages of the candidate drug being tested;\n\u2022failure of products being tested to satisfy safety requirements or efficacy criteria;\n\u2022unexpected or undesired clinical results for products;\n\u2022insufficient patient enrollment in a trial;\n\u2022insufficient principal investigator recruitment;\n\u2022production problems resulting in shortages of the product being tested;\n\u2022the customers\u2019 decision to terminate or scale back the development or commercialization of a product or to end a particular project;\n\u2022shift of business to a competitor or internal resources; or\n\u2022product withdrawal following market launch.\nOur commercial services contracts typically have a significantly shorter wind down period than clinical contracts, particularly within our Deployment Solutions offerings. Furthermore, many of our communications services and consulting services projects are tied to a customer\u2019s annual marketing budget or ad hoc service requests, which can lead to seasonal variability in revenue and less predictability in future revenues. In addition, many of our biopharmaceutical Deployment Solutions service contracts provide our customers with the opportunity to internalize the resources provided under the contract and terminate all or a portion of the services we provide under the contract. Our customers may also decide to shift their business to a competitor. Each of these factors results in less visibility to future revenues and may result in high volatility in future revenues.\nContract terminations, delays and modifications are a regular part of our business across each of our segments. For example, our full service offering within our Clinical Solutions business has been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted by project delays, which impact near term revenue disproportionately. In addition, project delays, downsizings and cancellations, particularly within our Deployment Solutions and communications offerings, which are part of our Commercial Solutions business, have impacted our results in the past and might impact them in the future. The loss, reduction in scope or delay of a large project or of multiple projects could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, we might not realize the full benefits of our backlog if our customers cancel, delay, or reduce their commitments to us.\nIn the event of termination, our contracts often provide for fees for winding down the project, which include both fees incurred and actual and non-cancellable expenditures and may include a fee to cover a percentage of the remaining professional fees on the project. These fees might not be sufficient for us to maintain our margins, and termination may result in lower resource utilization rates and therefore lower operating margins. In addition, cancellation of a contract or project for the reasons noted above may result in the unwillingness or inability of our customer to satisfy its existing obligations to us such as payments of accounts receivable, which may in turn result in a material impact to our results of operations and cash flow. Historically, cancellations and delays have negatively impacted our operating results, and they might again. In addition, we might not realize the full benefits of our backlog if our customers cancel, delay, or reduce their commitments to us, which may occur if, among other things, a customer decides to shift its business to a competitor or revoke our status as a preferred provider. Thus, the loss or delay of a large business award or the loss or delay of multiple awards could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Additionally, a change in the timing of a new business award could affect the period over which we recognize revenue and reduce our revenue in any one quarter.\nOur backlog might not be indicative of our future revenues, and we might not realize all of the anticipated future revenue reflected in our backlog.\nOur backlog consists of anticipated revenue awarded from contract and pre-contract commitments that are supported by written communications. Once work begins on a project, revenue is recognized over the duration of the project, provided the award has gone to contract. Projects may be canceled or delayed by the customer or delayed by regulatory authorities for reasons beyond our control. To the extent projects are delayed, the timing of our revenue could be adversely affected. In addition, if a customer terminates a contract, we typically would be entitled to receive payment for all services performed up to the termination date and subsequent customer-authorized services related to terminating the canceled project. Typically, however, we have no contractual right to the full amount of the future revenue reflected in our backlog in the event of a contract termination or subsequent changes in scope that reduce the value of the contract. The duration of the projects included in our backlog, and the related revenue recognition, typically range from a few months to several years. Our backlog might not be indicative of our future revenues, and we might not realize all the anticipated future revenue reflected in that backlog. A number of factors may affect backlog, including:\n\u2022the size, complexity, and duration of projects or strategic relationships;\n\u2022the cancellation or delay of projects;\n\u2022the failure of one or more business awards to go to contract; and\n\u2022changes in the scope of work during the course of projects.\nThe rate at which our backlog converts to revenue may vary over time. The revenue recognition on larger, more global projects could be slower than on smaller, more regional projects for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, an extended period of negotiation between the time the project is awarded to us and the actual execution of the contract, as well as an increased time frame for obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals.\nOur backlog at December 31, 2019 was $8.90 billion. Although an increase in backlog will generally result in an increase in revenues over time, an increase in backlog at a particular point in time does not necessarily correspond directly to an increase in revenues during any particular period, or at all. The extent to which contracts in backlog will result in revenue depends on many factors, including, but not limited to, delivery against project schedules, scope changes, contract terminations and the nature, duration, and complexity of the contracts, and can vary significantly over time.\nOur operating results have historically fluctuated between fiscal quarters and may continue to fluctuate in the future, which may adversely affect the market price of our stock.\nOur operating results have fluctuated in previous quarters and years and may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are influenced by a variety of factors, such as:\n\u2022timing of contract amendments for changes in scope that could affect the value of a contract and potentially impact the amount of net new business awards and revenue from quarter to quarter;\n\u2022commencement, completion, execution, postponement, or termination of large contracts;\n\u2022contract terms for the recognition of revenue milestones;\n\u2022progress of ongoing contracts and retention of customers;\n\u2022timing of and charges associated with completion of acquisitions, integration of acquired businesses, and other events;\n\u2022changes in the mix of services delivered, both in terms of geography and type of services;\n\u2022potential customer disputes, penalties or other issues that may impact the revenue we are able to recognize, or the collectability of our related accounts receivable; and\n\u2022exchange rate fluctuations.\nOur operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results and fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect the market price and liquidity of our stock.\nIf we underprice our contracts, overrun our cost estimates, or fail to receive approval for or experience delays in documentation of change orders, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nWe price our contracts based on assumptions regarding the scope of work required and cost to complete the work. We bear the financial risk if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates, which could adversely affect our cash flows and financial performance. In addition, contracts with our customers are subject to change orders, which occur when the scope of work we perform needs to be modified from that originally contemplated in our contract with the customers. This can occur, for example, when there is a change in a key study assumption or parameter or a significant change in timing. We may be unable to successfully negotiate changes in scope or change orders on a timely basis or at all, which could require us to incur cost outlays ahead of the receipt of any additional revenue. In addition, under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") we cannot recognize additional revenue anticipated from change orders until appropriate documentation is received by us from the customer authorizing the change. However, if we incur additional expense in anticipation of receipt of that documentation, we must recognize the expense as incurred. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur business depends on the continued effectiveness and availability of our information systems, including the information systems we use to provide services to our customers and to store employee data, and failures of these systems, including cyber-attacks, may materially limit our operations or have an adverse effect on our reputation.\nOur information systems consist of systems we have purchased or developed, legacy information systems from organizations we have acquired, including inVentiv and, increasingly, web-enabled and other integrated information systems. In using these information systems, we frequently rely on third-party vendors to provide hosting services, where our infrastructure is dependent upon the reliability of their underlying platforms, facilities, and communications systems. We also utilize integrated information systems that we provide customers access to or install for our customers in conjunction with our delivery of services.\nAs the breadth and complexity of our information systems continue to grow, we will increasingly be exposed to the risks inherent in maintaining the stability of our legacy systems due to prior customization, attrition of employees or vendors involved in their development, and obsolescence of the underlying technology, as well as risks from the increasing number and scope of external data breaches on multi-national companies. Because certain customers, clinical trials, and other long-term projects depend upon these legacy systems, we also face an increased level of embedded risk in maintaining the legacy systems and limited options to mitigate such risk. We are also exposed to risks associated with the availability of all our information systems, including:\n\u2022disruption, impairment or failure of data centers, telecommunications facilities or other key infrastructure platforms, including those maintained by our third-party vendors;\n\u2022security breaches of, cyber-attacks on, and other failures or malfunctions in our internal systems, including our employee data and communications, critical application systems or their associated hardware; and\n\u2022excessive costs, excessive delays, or other deficiencies in systems development and deployment.\nThe materialization of any of these risks may impede the processing of data, the delivery of databases and services, and the day-to-day management of our business and could result in the corruption, loss or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary, confidential, or other data. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of our databases and services, diverting resources from other projects and disrupting our business. Our disaster recovery plans might not adequately protect us in the event of a system failure. Despite any precautions we take, damage from fire, floods, hurricanes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins, and similar events at our various computer facilities or those of our third-party vendors could result in interruptions in the flow of data to us and from us to our customers. Corruption or loss of data may result in the need to repeat a project at no cost to the customer, but at significant cost to us, the termination of a contract, civil or criminal enforcement actions and penalties, or damage to our reputation. Additionally, significant delays in system enhancements or inadequate performance of new or upgraded systems once completed could damage our reputation and harm our business. Finally, long-term disruptions in the infrastructure caused by events such as natural disasters, the outbreak of war, the escalation of hostilities and acts of terrorism, particularly involving cities in which we have offices, and cyber-attacks such as those recently faced by other multi-national companies could adversely affect our businesses. As our business continues to expand globally, these types of risks may be further increased by instability in the geopolitical climate of certain regions, underdeveloped and less stable utilities and communications infrastructure, and other local and regional factors. Although we carry property and business interruption insurance that we believe is customary for our industry, our coverage might not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur.\nUnauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential data, including personal data, whether through systems failure or employee actions, cyber-attacks, fraud, or misappropriation, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers. Similarly, we have been and expect that we will continue to be subject to attempts to gain unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we internally or externally develop for our customers, including a cyber-attack by computer programmers and hackers who may develop and deploy viruses, worms, or other malicious software programs, process breakdowns, denial-of-service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing. In addition, we may be susceptible to physical or computer-based attacks by terrorists or hackers due to our role in the\nbiopharmaceutical service industry. These concerns about security are increased when information is transmitted over the Internet. If such attacks are not detected immediately, their effect could be compounded. To date these attacks have not had a material impact on our operations or financial results. However, successful attacks in the future could result in negative publicity, significant remediation and recovery costs, legal liability and damage to our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, our liability insurance might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks and other related breaches.\nAdditionally, we rely on service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network. If a service provider fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require for similar reasons, the failure could interrupt our services. Because of the centrality of our processing systems to our business, any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of our brands' reliability and harm our business. If a service provider experiences the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential data they are processing on our behalf, whether through systems failure or employee actions, cyber-attacks, fraud, or misappropriation, it could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers. Similarly, such disclosure could result in negative publicity, significant remediation and recovery costs, legal liability and damage to our reputation, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, contractual indemnity, the service provider\u2019s liability insurance and our liability insurance might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks, and other related breaches.\nWe are subject to governmental regulation and legal obligations in the areas of privacy, data, and security. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.\nPrivacy, data and security continue to receive heightened legislative and regulatory focus in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. For example, in many jurisdictions individuals whose personal information has been collected must be notified in the event of a data breach and those jurisdictions that have these laws are continuing to increase the circumstances requiring these notices and the breadth of information they must include. Complying with these numerous, complex and often changing regulations is expensive and difficult. We are likely to be required to expend capital and other resources to ensure ongoing compliance with these laws and regulations. Our failure, the failure of our customers, our partners, our service providers, or our employees or contractors to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions, litigation, damages, cost for mitigation activities and damage to our global reputation and our brands. For example, failure by us, our customers, our partners, our service providers, or our employees or contractors to comply with the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") could result in regulatory investigations, enforcement notices and/ or fines of up to the higher of 20,000,000 Euros or up to 4% of our total worldwide annual revenue. In addition, laws and expectations relating to privacy, security and data protection continue to evolve in ways that may limit our data access, use and disclosure, and may require increased expenditures by us or may dictate that we not offer certain types of services.\nOur customer or therapeutic area concentration may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf any large customer decreases or terminates its relationship with us, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our top ten customers based on revenue accounted for approximately 35% of our consolidated revenue and our top ten Clinical Solutions customers based on backlog accounted for approximately 38% of our total backlog. No single customer accounted for greater than 10% of our total consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, one customer accounted for approximately 11% of our revenue, which was primarily earned in our Clinical Solutions Segment. It is possible that an even greater portion of our revenues will be attributable to a smaller number of customers in the future, including as a result of our entering into strategic provider relationships with customers. Also, consolidation in our potential customer base results in increased competition for important market segments and fewer available customer accounts.\nAdditionally, conducting multiple clinical trials for different sponsors in a single therapeutic class involving drugs with the same or similar chemical action may adversely affect our business if some or all of the trials are canceled because of new scientific information or regulatory judgments that affect the drugs as a class.\nSimilarly, marketing and selling products for different sponsors with similar drug action subjects us to risk if new scientific information or regulatory judgment prejudices the products as a class, leading to compelled or voluntary prescription limitations or withdrawal of some or all of the products from the market.\nOur business is subject to international economic, political and other risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or reputation.\nWe have operations in many foreign countries, including, but not limited to, countries in the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East and Africa. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 53% of our workforce was located outside of the United States, and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 37% of our revenue was earned from locations outside the United States. Our international operations are subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in operating in these regions, including:\n\u2022conducting a single project across multiple countries is complex, and issues in one country, such as a failure to comply with or unanticipated changes to local regulations, or restrictions such as restrictions on import or export of clinical trial material or availability of clinical trial data may affect the progress of the clinical trial in the other countries, resulting in delays or potential termination of contracts, which in turn may result in loss of revenue;\n\u2022the United States or other countries could enact legislation or impose regulations or other restrictions, including unfavorable labor regulations, tax policies, data protection regulations or economic sanctions, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business in or expatriate profits from the countries in which we operate;\n\u2022foreign countries are expanding or may expand their banking regulations that govern international currency transactions, particularly cross-border transfers, which may inhibit our ability to transfer funds into or within a jurisdiction, impeding our ability to pay our principal investigators, vendors and employees, thereby impacting our ability to conduct trials in such jurisdictions;\n\u2022foreign countries are expanding or may expand their regulatory framework with respect to patient informed consent, protection and compensation in clinical trials, or transparency reporting requirements (similar to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act in the United States), which could delay, inhibit or prohibit our ability to conduct projects in such jurisdictions;\n\u2022the regulatory or judicial authorities of foreign countries might not enforce legal rights and recognize business procedures in a manner in which we are accustomed or would reasonably expect;\n\u2022changes in political and economic conditions, including the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union and the policies of the current U.S. presidential administration, may lead to changes in the business environment in which we operate, as well as changes in inflation and foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022potential violations of applicable anti-bribery/anti-corruption laws, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and the UK Bribery Act of 2010, may cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or reputation;\n\u2022customers in foreign jurisdictions may have longer payment cycles, and it may be more difficult to collect receivables in those jurisdictions;\n\u2022natural disasters, pandemics, or international conflict, including terrorist acts, could interrupt our services, endanger our personnel, or cause project delays or loss of clinical trial materials or results;\n\u2022political unrest, such as the current situations in the Middle East, could delay or disrupt the ability to conduct clinical trials or other business; and\n\u2022foreign governments may enact currency exchange controls that may limit the ability to fund our operations or significantly increase the cost of maintaining operations.\nThese risks and uncertainties could negatively impact our ability to, among other things, perform large, global projects for our customers. Furthermore, our ability to deal with these issues could be affected by applicable U.S. laws. Any such risks could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or reputation.\nThe impact of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets, and demand for our services, which could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOn January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union (\"Brexit\"). The terms of such withdrawal continue to be subject to complex and ongoing negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union, the impact of which remains unclear, creating significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union.\nThese developments have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and could significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Lack of clarity about future United Kingdom laws and regulations, including financial laws and regulations, tax and free trade agreements, and intellectual property and employment laws, could decrease foreign direct investment in the United Kingdom, increase costs, and could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital. If the United Kingdom and the European Union are unable to negotiate acceptable withdrawal terms or if other Member States pursue withdrawal, barrier free access between the United Kingdom and other Member States or among the European economic area overall could be diminished or eliminated. Additionally, political instability in the European Union as a result of Brexit may result in a material negative effect on credit markets and foreign direct investments in the EU and United Kingdom.\nAny of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2019, revenue attributed to the United Kingdom represented 6% of our total revenue. In addition, we have a substantial physical presence in the United Kingdom, in particular at our Farnborough facility. These operations subject us to revenue risk with respect to our customers in the United Kingdom and adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, in addition to risks related to the general economic and legal uncertainty related to Brexit described above.\nGovernmental authorities may question our intercompany transfer pricing policies or change their laws in a manner that could increase our effective tax rate or otherwise harm our business.\nAs a U.S. company doing business in international markets through subsidiaries, we are subject to foreign tax and intercompany pricing laws, including those relating to the flow of funds between legal entities in various international jurisdictions. Tax authorities in the United States and in international markets have the right to examine our corporate structure and how we account for intercompany fund transfers. If such authorities challenge our corporate structure, transfer pricing mechanisms or intercompany transfers and the resulting assessments are upheld, our operations may be negatively impacted and our effective tax rate may increase. Tax rates vary from country to country and if a tax authority determines that our profits in one jurisdiction should be increased, we might not be able to realize the full tax benefits in the event we cannot utilize all foreign tax credits that are generated, or we do not realize a compensating offsetting adjustment in another taxing jurisdiction. The effects of either would increase our effective tax rate. Additionally, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has issued certain guidelines regarding base erosion and profit shifting. As these guidelines continue to be formally adopted by separate taxing jurisdictions, we may need to change our approach to intercompany transfer pricing in order to maintain compliance under the new rules. Our effective tax rate may increase or decrease depending on the current location of global operations at the time of the change. Finally, we might not always be in compliance with all applicable customs, exchange control, Value Added Tax, and transfer pricing laws despite our efforts to be aware of and to comply with such laws. If these laws change we may need to adjust our operating procedures and our business could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to successfully increase our market share, our ability to grow our business and execute our growth strategies could be materially adversely affected.\nA key element of our growth strategy is increasing our market share within the biopharmaceutical services market, the clinical development market and in the geographic markets in which we operate. In addition, we continue to invest in expanding new services such as our late phase offerings, along with solutions for our medical device customers. As we grow our market share within the biopharmaceutical services and clinical development markets and make investments in growing our newer service offerings, we might not have or adequately build the competencies necessary to perform our services satisfactorily or may face increased competition. If we are unable to succeed in increasing our market share or realize the benefits of our investments in our new service offerings, we may be unable to implement this element of our growth strategy, and our ability to grow our business or maintain our operating margins could be adversely affected.\nUpgrading the information systems that support our operating processes and evolving the technology platform for our services pose risks to our business.\nContinued efficient operation of our business requires that we implement standardized global business processes and evolve our information systems to enable this implementation, especially in the course of integrating acquired businesses into our company. We have continued to undertake significant programs to optimize business processes with respect to our services. Our inability to effectively manage the implementation of new information systems or upgrades and adapt to new processes designed into these new or upgraded systems in a timely and cost-effective manner may result in disruption to our business and negatively affect our operations.\nWe have entered into agreements with certain vendors to provide systems development, integration, and hosting services that develop or license to us the information technology (\"IT\") platforms and capacity for programs to optimize our business processes. If such vendors or their products fail to perform as required or if there are substantial delays in developing, implementing, and updating our IT platforms, our customer delivery may be impaired, and we may have to make substantial further investments, internally or with third parties, to achieve our objectives. For example, we rely on an external vendor to provide the clinical trial management software used in managing the completion of our customer clinical trials. If that externally provided system is not properly maintained we might not be able to meet the obligations of our contracts or may need to incur significant costs to replace the system or capability. Additionally, our progress may be limited by parties with existing or claimed patents who seek to enjoin us from using preferred technology or seek license payments from us.\nMeeting our objectives is dependent on a number of factors which might not take place as we anticipate, including obtaining adequate technology-enabled services, depending upon our third-party vendors to develop and enhance existing applications to adequately support our business, creating IT-enabled services that our customers will find desirable, and implementing our business model with respect to these services. Also, increased IT-related expenditures and our potential inability to anticipate increases in service costs may negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIf we fail to perform our services in accordance with contractual requirements, regulatory requirements, and ethical considerations, we could be subject to significant costs or liability and our reputation could be harmed.\nWe contract with biopharmaceutical companies to perform a wide range of services to assist them in bringing new drugs to market and to support the commercial activity of products already in the marketplace. Our services include monitoring clinical trials, data and laboratory analysis, electronic data capture, patient recruitment, product launch consulting, Deployment Solutions, advertising, publications, and medical communications, and other related services. Such services are complex and subject to contractual requirements, regulatory standards, and ethical considerations. For example, we must adhere to applicable regulatory requirements such as those required by the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, including those laws and regulations governing the promotion, sales, and marketing of biopharmaceutical products, and Good Clinical Practice requirements, which govern, among other things, the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials. Once initiated, clinical trials must be conducted pursuant to and in accordance with the applicable IND, the requirements of the relevant IRBs, and GCP regulations. We are also subject to regulation by the Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) which regulates the distribution, recordkeeping, handling, security, and disposal of controlled substances. If we fail to perform our services in accordance with these requirements, regulatory agencies may take action against us or our customers. Such actions may include sanctions such as injunctions or failure of such regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of products, imposition of clinical holds or delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, rejection of data collected in our studies, license revocation, product seizures or recalls, operational restrictions, civil or criminal penalties or prosecutions, damages, or fines. Additionally, there is a risk that actions by regulatory authorities, if they result in significant inspectional observations or other measures, could harm our reputation and cause customers not to award us future contracts or to cancel existing contracts. Customers may also bring claims against us for breach of our contractual obligations, and patients in the clinical trials and patients taking drugs approved on the basis of those trials may bring personal injury claims against us. Any such action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or reputation.\nSuch consequences could arise if, among other things, the following occur:\nImproper performance of our services. The performance of our clinical development and other biopharmaceutical services is complex and time-consuming. For example, we may make mistakes in conducting a clinical trial that could negatively impact or obviate the usefulness of the clinical trial or cause the results of the clinical trial to be reported improperly. If the clinical trial results are compromised, we could be subject to significant costs or liability, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to perform our services and our reputation could be harmed. For example:\n\u2022non-compliance generally could result in the termination of ongoing clinical trials or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities;\n\u2022compromise of data from a particular trial, such as failure to verify that adequate informed consent was obtained from subjects or improper monitoring of data, could require us to repeat the clinical trial under the terms of our contract at no further cost to our customer, but at a substantial cost to us; and\n\u2022breach of a contractual term could result in liability for damages or termination of the contract.\nLarge clinical trials can cost hundreds of millions of dollars and improper performance of our services could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, damage our reputation, and result in the termination of current contracts or failure to obtain future contracts from the affected customer or other customers.\nInteractive Voice/Web Response Technology malfunction. We develop, maintain, and use third-party computer-based interactive voice/web response systems to automatically manage the randomization of patients in a given clinical trial to different treatment arms and regulate the supply of investigational drugs, all by means of interactive voice/web response systems. An error in the design, programming, or validation of these systems could lead to inappropriate assignment or dosing of patients which could give rise to patient safety issues, invalidation of the trial, or liability claims against us. Furthermore, negative publicity associated with such a malfunction could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation. Additionally, errors in\nrandomization may require us to repeat the clinical trial at no further cost to our customer, but at a substantial cost to us.\nInvestigation of customers. From time to time, one or more of our customers are audited or investigated by regulatory authorities or enforcement agencies with respect to regulatory compliance of their clinical trials, programs, or the marketing and sale of their drugs. In these situations, we have often provided services to our customers with respect to the clinical trials, programs, or activities being audited or investigated, and we are called upon to respond to requests for information by the authorities and agencies. There is a risk that either our customers or regulatory authorities could claim that we performed our services improperly or that we are responsible for clinical trial or program compliance. If our customers or regulatory authorities make such claims against us and prove them, we could be subject to damages, fines, or penalties. In addition, negative publicity regarding regulatory compliance of our customers' clinical trials, programs, or drugs could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nInsufficient customer funding to complete a clinical trial. As noted above, clinical trials can cost hundreds of millions of dollars. There is a risk that we may initiate a clinical trial for a customer, and then the customer becomes unwilling or unable to fund the completion of the trial. In such a situation, notwithstanding the customer's ability or willingness to pay for or otherwise facilitate the completion of the trial, we may be ethically bound to complete or wind down the clinical trial at our own expense.\nIn addition to the above U.S. laws and regulations, we must comply with the laws of all countries where we do business, including laws governing clinical trials in the jurisdiction where the trials are performed. Failure to comply with applicable requirements could subject us to regulatory risk, liability, and potential costs associated with redoing the trials, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results.\nAny litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend.\nWe are subject to and may become subject, from time to time, to additional legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business or pursuant to governmental or regulatory enforcement activity. While we do not believe that the resolution of any currently pending lawsuits against us will, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, we might be wrong, and future litigation might result in substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources, which might seriously harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Insurance might not cover such claims, provide sufficient payments to cover all of the costs to resolve one or more such claims, or continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. In particular, any claim could result in potential liability for us if the claim is outside the scope of the indemnification agreement we have with our customers, our customers do not abide by the indemnification agreement as required or the liability exceeds the amount of any applicable indemnification limits or available insurance coverage. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or reputation.\nThe operation of our early phase (Phase I and IIA) clinical facilities and the services we provide there as well as our clinical trial management, including direct interaction with clinical trial patients or volunteers, could create potential liability that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and reputation.\nWe operate facilities where early phase clinical trials are conducted, which ordinarily involve testing an investigational drug on a limited number of individuals to evaluate a product\u2019s safety, determine a safe dosage range and identify side effects. Additionally, our business involves clinical trial management, which is one of our clinical development service offerings, and includes the testing of investigational drugs on human volunteers. Some of these trials involve the administration of investigational drugs to known substance abusers or volunteers and patients that are already seriously ill and are at risk for further illness or death. Failure to operate any of our early phase facilities in accordance with applicable regulations could result in that facility being shut down, which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and reputation.\nAdditionally, we face risks resulting from the administration of drugs to volunteers, including adverse events, and the professional malpractice of medical care providers, including improper administration of a drug or device. We also directly employ doctors, nurses, and other trained employees who assist in implementing the testing involved in our clinical trials, such as drawing blood from healthy volunteers. Our exposure with respect to these activities could exceed any contractual limits on indemnification in our contracts with customers and vendors. Any professional malpractice or negligence by such doctors, nurses, principal investigators, or other employees could potentially result in liability to us in the event of personal injury to or death of a volunteer in clinical trials. This liability, particularly if it were to exceed the limits of any indemnification agreements and insurance coverage we may have, may adversely affect our business and financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and reputation.\nIf our insurance does not cover all of our indemnification obligations and other liabilities associated with our operations, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nWe maintain insurance designed to provide coverage for ordinary risks associated with our operations and our ordinary indemnification obligations that we believe to be customary for our industry. The coverage provided by such insurance might not be adequate for all claims we make or may be contested by our insurance carriers. If our insurance is not adequate or available to pay all claims or exposures associated with our operations, or if we are unable to purchase adequate insurance at reasonable rates in the future, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to attract suitable principal investigators and recruit and enroll patients for clinical trials, our clinical development business might suffer.\nThe recruitment of principal investigators and patients for clinical trials is essential to our business. Principal investigators are typically located at hospitals, clinics, or other sites and supervise the administration of the investigational drug to patients during the course of a clinical trial. Patients generally include people from the communities in which the clinical trials are conducted. Several of our competitors have purchased site networks or site management organizations as a strategy for priority access to a specific site, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Our clinical development business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract suitable and willing principal investigators or recruit and enroll patients for clinical trials on a consistent basis. The expanding global nature of clinical trials increases the risk associated with attracting suitable principal investigators and patients, especially if these trials are conducted in regions where our resources or experience may be more limited. For example, if we are unable to engage principal investigators to conduct clinical trials as planned or enroll sufficient patients in clinical trials, we might need to expend additional funds to obtain access to more principal investigators and patients than planned or else be compelled to delay or modify the clinical trial plans, which may result in additional costs to us or cancellation of the clinical trial by our customer. If realized, these risks may also inhibit our ability to attract new business, particularly in certain regions.\nOur business could result in liability to us if a drug causes harm to a patient. While we are generally indemnified and insured against such risks, we may still suffer financial losses.\nWhen we market drugs under contract for a biopharmaceutical company, we could suffer liability for harm allegedly caused by those drugs, either as a result of a lawsuit against the biopharmaceutical company to which we are joined, a lawsuit naming us or any of our subsidiaries, or an action launched by a regulatory body. Any claim could result in potential liability for us if the claim is outside the scope of the indemnification agreement we have with the biopharmaceutical company, the biopharmaceutical company does not abide by the indemnification agreement as required, or the liability exceeds the amount of any applicable indemnification limits or available insurance coverage. Such a result could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and reputation. Furthermore, negative publicity associated with harm caused by drugs we helped to market could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nInvestments in our customers\u2019 businesses or drugs and our related commercial rights strategies could have a negative impact on our financial performance.\nWe may enter into arrangements with our customers or other drug companies in which we take on some of the risk of the potential success or failure of their businesses or drugs, including making strategic investments in our customers or other drug companies, providing financing to customers or other drug companies, or acquiring an interest in the revenues from customers\u2019 drugs or in entities developing a limited number of drugs. Before entering into any such arrangements, we carefully analyze and select the customers and drugs with which we are willing to structure our risk-based deals. Our financial results could be adversely affected if these investments or the underlying drugs result in losses, do not achieve the level of success that we anticipate, and/or our return or payment from the drug investment or financing is less than our direct and indirect costs with respect to these arrangements. Additionally, there is a risk that we are not awarded projects by other customers who believe we are in competition with them because of these investments, which would negatively impact future awards.\nIf we lose the services of key personnel or are unable to recruit experienced personnel, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or reputation could be materially adversely affected.\nOur success substantially depends on the collective performance, contributions, and expertise of our senior management team and other key personnel including qualified management, professional, scientific, and technical operating staff, and business development personnel, particularly as we integrate acquired businesses into our company. There is significant competition for qualified personnel, particularly those with higher educational degrees, in the biopharmaceutical and related services industries. In addition, the close proximity of some of our facilities to offices of our major competitors could adversely impact our ability to successfully recruit and retain key personnel. The departure of any key executive, or our inability to continue to identify, attract and retain qualified personnel or replace any departed personnel in a timely fashion, might impact our ability to grow our business and compete effectively in our industry and might negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or reputation.\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nApproximately 18% of our fiscal year 2019 revenue was contracted in currencies other than U.S. dollars and 42% of our direct and operating costs are incurred in countries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars and changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Our primary exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is related to the following risks:\nForeign Currency Risk from Differences in Customer Contract Currency and Operating Costs Currency. The majority of our global contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars or Euros while our operating costs in foreign countries are denominated in various local currencies. Fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies we use to contract with our customers and the currencies in which we incur cost to fulfill those contracts can have a significant impact on our results of operations.\nForeign Currency Translation Risk. The revenue and expenses of our international operations are generally denominated in local currencies and translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, exchange rate fluctuations between the value of the U.S. dollar versus local currencies will affect the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency denominated revenue, costs, and results of operations.\nForeign Currency Transaction Risk. We earn revenue from our service contracts over a period of several months and, in many cases, over several years, resulting in timing differences between the consummation and cash settlement of a transaction. Accordingly, profitability of the transactions denominated in foreign currencies is subject to effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the period of time between the consummation and cash settlement of a transaction.\nWe may seek to limit our exposure to these risks through inclusion of foreign currency exchange rate provisions in our service contracts, and/or by hedging certain exposures with foreign exchange derivative instruments. These measures, however, might not offset or mitigate any, or all of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates.\nUnfavorable economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nUnfavorable economic conditions and other adverse macroeconomic factors on global and domestic markets might result, among other matters, in tightening in the credit and capital markets, low liquidity, and volatility in fixed income, credit, currency, and equity markets. Such conditions could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. For example, our customers might not be able to raise money to conduct existing clinical trials, or to fund new drug development and related future clinical trials. Resource-sharing customers may also scale back commercial support for their products. In addition, economic or market disruptions could negatively impact our vendors, contractors, or principal investigators which might have a negative effect on our business.\nOur effective income tax rate may fluctuate, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur effective income tax rate is influenced by our projected profitability in the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in the distribution of profits and losses among taxing jurisdictions may have a significant impact on our effective income tax rate, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Factors that may affect our effective income tax rate include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022the requirement to exclude from our quarterly worldwide effective income tax calculations the benefit for losses in jurisdictions where no income tax benefit can be recognized;\n\u2022actual and projected full year pre-tax income;\n\u2022the repatriation of foreign earnings to the United States;\n\u2022uncertain tax positions;\n\u2022changes in tax laws in various taxing jurisdictions, including interpretations of proposed regulations related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d);\n\u2022audits by taxing authorities;\n\u2022the establishment of valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that future income tax benefits will not be realized;\n\u2022the release of a previously established valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that future income tax benefits will be realized;\n\u2022changes in the relative mix and size of clinical studies in various tax jurisdictions; and\n\u2022the timing and amount of the vesting and exercising of share-based compensation.\nThese changes may cause fluctuations in our effective income tax rate that could adversely affect our results of operations and cause fluctuations in our earnings and earnings per share.\nWe have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights, and these rights are important to our success.\nWe develop, use, and protect our proprietary methodologies, analytics, systems, technologies, and other intellectual property. Existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights, and the protection in some countries may be very limited. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, nondisclosure agreements, and other contractual arrangements, as well as copyright and trademark laws, to protect our intellectual property rights. These laws are subject to change at any time and certain agreements might not be fully enforceable, which could further restrict our ability to protect our innovations. Our intellectual property rights might not prevent competitors from independently developing services similar to or duplicative of ours or alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions. The steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property or claims against us for alleged infringement or misappropriation by competitors, former employees, or other third parties. Furthermore, we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Enforcing our rights might also require considerable time, money, and oversight, and we might not be successful in enforcing our rights.\nOur acquisition strategy may present additional risks, including the risk that we may be unable to fully realize the competitive and operating synergies projected to be achieved through any specific acquisition.\nWe have historically grown our business both organically and through acquisitions, most notably the acquisition of inVentiv. We have and will continue to assess the need and opportunity to offer additional services through acquisitions of other companies. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022ability to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or obtain any necessary financing on commercially acceptable terms;\n\u2022increased risk to our financial position and liquidity through changes to our capital structure and assumption of acquired liabilities, including any indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisitions and related interest expense;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from normal daily operations of the business;\n\u2022insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions;\n\u2022assumption of liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies, including liabilities for their failure to comply with healthcare, tax, and other regulations;\n\u2022inability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition;\n\u2022difficulties integrating and documenting processes and controls in conformance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u2022ability to integrate acquired operations, products, and technologies into our business;\n\u2022difficulties retaining and integrating acquired personnel and distinct cultures into our business; and\n\u2022the potential loss of key employees, customers, or projects.\nFor example, fully realizing the anticipated benefits of the Merger will depend on, among other things, our ability to combine the INC Research business with the inVentiv business and to achieve operating synergies. We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with consummation of the Merger and combining the businesses, operations, networks, systems, technologies, policies, and procedures of the two companies, including integrating and documenting processes and controls in conformance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which were not applicable to inVentiv prior to the Merger. If we are unsuccessful in managing our integrated operations, or if we do not fully realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, and other benefits currently anticipated from the Merger, our operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and we might not be able to take advantage of business development opportunities.\nWe may also spend time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition targets but not complete the transaction. Any acquisition could involve other risks, including, among others, the assumption of additional liabilities and expenses, difficulties and expenses in connection with integrating the acquired companies and achieving the expected benefits, issuances of potentially dilutive securities or interest-bearing debt, loss of key employees of the acquired companies, transaction expenses, diversion of management's attention from other business concerns, and, with respect to the acquisition of international companies, the inability to overcome differences in international business practices, language and customs. Our failure to successfully integrate potential future acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur relationships with existing or potential customers who are in competition with each other may adversely impact the degree to which other customers or potential customers use our services, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, with biopharmaceutical companies each seeking to persuade payers, providers, and patients that their drug therapies are better and more cost-effective than competing therapies marketed or being developed by competing firms. In addition to the adverse competitive interests that biopharmaceutical companies have with each other, biopharmaceutical companies also have adverse interests with respect to drug selection and reimbursement with other participants in the healthcare industry, including payers and providers. Biopharmaceutical companies also compete to be first to market with new drug therapies. We regularly provide services to biopharmaceutical companies that compete with each other, and we sometimes provide services to such customers regarding competing drugs in the market and in development. Our existing or future relationships, particularly broader strategic provider and commercial relationships, with our biopharmaceutical customers may therefore deter other biopharmaceutical customers from using our services or may result in our customers seeking to place limits on our ability to serve other biopharmaceutical industry participants. In addition, our further expansion into the broader healthcare market may adversely impact our relationships with biopharmaceutical customers, and such customers may elect not to use our services, reduce the scope of services that we provide to them or seek to place restrictions on our ability to serve customers in the broader healthcare market with interests that are adverse to theirs. Any loss of customers or reductions in the level of revenues from a customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our goodwill and intangible assets.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our goodwill and net intangible assets were valued at $5.32 billion, which constituted approximately 71% of our total assets.\nOur goodwill is principally related to the acquisition of inVentiv completed in August 2017. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the operating segment level. This test requires us to determine if the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying amount. The impairment analysis requires significant judgments, estimates and assumptions. There is no assurance that the actual future earnings or cash flows of the reporting units will not decline significantly from the projections used in the impairment analysis. Goodwill impairment charges may be recognized in future periods in one or more of the reporting units to the extent changes in factors or circumstances occur, including deterioration in the macroeconomic environment or industry, deterioration in our performance or our future projections, or changes in plans for one or more of our reporting units. As of December 31, 2019, our goodwill is assigned to five reporting units. We completed our annual impairment test as of October 1, 2019 for all of our reporting units, and concluded that there were no impairments.\nIntangible assets consist of backlog, customer relationships, and trademarks. We review intangible assets at the end of each reporting period to determine if facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than originally estimated or that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist, we assess the recoverability of identified assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives to their respective carrying amounts. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets and occur in the period in which the impairment determination was made. We have experienced material impairment losses in the past, including an impairment charge of $30.0 million in 2017 related to the impairment of the INC Research tradename in connection with our rebranding in 2018, and could experience additional material impairment losses in the future. The process of testing intangible assets for impairment involves numerous judgments, assumptions, and estimates made by management including expected future profitability, cash flows, and the fair values of assets and liabilities, which inherently reflect a high degree of uncertainty and may be affected by significant variability. If the business climate deteriorates, then actual results may not be consistent with these judgments, assumptions, and estimates, and our intangible assets may become impaired in future periods. This could in turn have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe face risks arising from the restructuring of our operations, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or business reputation.\nFrom time to time, we have adopted cost savings initiatives to improve our operating efficiency through various means such as: (i) the reduction of overcapacity, primarily in our costs of services (billable) function; (ii) elimination of non-billable support roles; and (iii) the consolidation or other realignment of our resources. In connection with our 2017 merger with inVentiv Health (the \"Merger\") we have established a restructuring plan to eliminate redundant positions and reduce our facility footprint worldwide. We expect to continue the ongoing evaluations of our workforce and facilities infrastructure needs through 2020 in an effort to optimize our resources worldwide. Additionally, in conjunction with the Merger, we assumed certain liabilities related to employee severance and facility closure costs as a result of actions taken by inVentiv prior to the Merger. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized approximately $12.0 million of employee severance and benefit costs and facility closure and lease termination costs of $12.9 million related to the Merger. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized approximately $13.2 million of non-Merger related employee severance costs, facility closure and lease termination costs of $3.3 million, and other costs of $0.7 million related to our focus on optimizing our resources worldwide.\nRestructuring actions present significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or business reputation. Such risks include:\n\u2022a decrease in employee morale and retention of key employees;\n\u2022a greater number of employment claims;\n\u2022actual or perceived disruption of service or reduction in service standards to customers;\n\u2022the failure to preserve supplier relationships and distribution, sales and other important relationships, and to resolve conflicts that may arise;\n\u2022the failure to achieve targeted cost savings; and\n\u2022the failure to meet operational targets and customer requirements due to the loss of employees and any work stoppages that might occur.\nWe operate in many different jurisdictions and we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA, U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, and/or similar worldwide anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws.\nThe FCPA, U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, anti-corruption laws have appeared to conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, we cannot assure that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts in violation of anti-corruption laws committed by persons associated with us, and our continued expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase such risk in the future. Violations of the FCPA or other ex-U.S. anti-corruption laws, or even allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and reputation. For example, violations of anti-corruption laws can result in restatements of, or irregularities in, our financial statements as well as severe criminal or civil sanctions. In some cases, companies that violate the FCPA (or similar laws in other jurisdictions outside the U.S.) might be debarred by the U.S. government and/or lose their U.S. export privileges. In addition, U.S. or other governments might seek to hold us liable for successor liability for FCPA violations or violations of other anti-corruption laws committed by companies that we acquire or in which we invest, or by or on behalf of persons working for or representing our Company. Changes in anti-corruption laws or enforcement priorities could also result in increased compliance requirements and related costs which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe failure of third parties to provide us critical support services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or reputation.\nWe depend on third parties for support services vital to our business. Such support services include, but are not limited to, IT services, laboratory services, third-party transportation and travel providers, freight forwarders and customs brokers, drug depots and distribution centers, suppliers or contract manufacturers of drugs for patients participating in clinical trials, and providers of licensing agreements, maintenance contracts, or other services. In addition, we also rely on third-party CROs and other contract clinical personnel for clinical services either in regions where we have limited resources, or in cases where demand cannot be met by our internal staff. The failure of any of these third parties to adequately provide us critical support services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or reputation.\nOur embedded and functional outsourcing services could subject us to employment liability, which may cause adverse effects on our business.\nWith our embedded and functional outsourcing services, we place employees at the physical workplaces of our customers. The risks of this activity include claims of errors and omissions, misuse or misappropriation of client proprietary information, theft of client property, and torts or other claims under employment liability, co-employment liability, or joint employment liability. We have policies and guidelines in place to reduce our exposure to such risks, but if we fail to follow these policies and guidelines we may suffer reputational damage, loss of customer relationships and business, and monetary damages.\nWe might not be able to utilize certain of our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes, which could harm our profitability.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $569.5 million of net operating loss carry forwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) available to reduce U.S. federal taxable income in future years. Under Section 382 and similar provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\u201d), if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d that corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or similar provisions of other jurisdictions). These limitations may be subject to certain exceptions, including if there is \u201cnet unrealized built-in gain\u201d in the assets of the corporation undergoing the ownership change.\ninVentiv had significant NOLs for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which, until they expire, generally can be carried forward to reduce taxable income in future years. In addition, certain of inVentiv\u2019s NOLs and tax attributes are subject to existing limitations under Section 382 and similar provisions of the Code as a result of inVentiv\u2019s prior ownership changes. The application of these provisions with respect to inVentiv\u2019s NOLs and other tax attributes, including the determination of the amount of any \u201cnet unrealized built-in gain\u201d in inVentiv\u2019s assets, is complex, involving, among other things, certain factual determinations regarding value and built-in gain amounts. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the IRS (or other taxing authority in a jurisdiction applying similar law) would not assert our ability to utilize inVentiv\u2019s NOLs and other tax attributes is subject to limitations that are different from the limitations as determined by us, or that a court would not agree with such an assertion.\nThe benefit of the inVentiv NOLs is uncertain even without regard to the Section 382 rules. Due to the corporate income tax rate change pursuant to the Tax Act, the value of our NOLs was significantly decreased. In addition, a portion of inVentiv\u2019s NOLs arise from certain transaction tax deductions associated with Double Eagle\u2019s acquisition of inVentiv on November 9, 2016. Pursuant to that acquisition, inVentiv generally has a contingent obligation to pay former shareholders of inVentiv Group Holdings the value of U.S. federal, state, and local tax benefits arising from those transaction tax deductions as such benefits are realized and, consequently, the ability of the combined company to benefit from inVentiv\u2019s NOLs will be limited to the extent of such contingent obligation. As of December 31, 2019, the remaining contingent obligation due to the former shareholders of inVentiv Group Holdings related to the benefits above is approximately $32.7 million.\nDowngrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect us.\nWe can be adversely affected by downgrades of our credit ratings because ratings are a factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness, including covenants and interest rates. Our customers and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms, and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nMany of our vendors have the right to declare us in default of our agreements if any such vendor, including the lessors under our vehicle fleet leases, determines that a change in our financial condition poses a substantially increased credit risk. Upon default, the lessors can repossess the vehicles and require us to compensate them for any remaining lease payments in excess of the value of the repossessed vehicles. As of December 31, 2019, we had $54.7 million in finance lease obligations, primarily related to vehicles used in Deployment Solutions in the United States. Deployment Solutions may be negatively impacted if we lose the use of vehicles for any period of time.\nOur credit agreement (as amended, the \"Credit Agreement\") contains covenants that may restrict our ability to, among other things, borrow money, pay dividends, make capital expenditures, make strategic acquisitions and effect a consolidation, merger, or disposal of all or substantially all of our assets. Refer to \"Risks Related to Our Indebtedness - Covenant restrictions under our Credit Agreement may limit our ability to operate our business\" for further details on our covenant restrictions.\nThe novel coronavirus outbreak could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nIn December 2019, a strain of novel coronavirus surfaced in Wuhan, China. In January 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a \u201cPublic Health Emergency of International Concern\u201d and the U.S. Department of State instructed travelers to avoid all nonessential travel to China. We conduct a number of clinical trials in China and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, on behalf of our clients. Due to restrictions imposed by the Chinese government and measures we have chosen to implement for the health of our employees, customers and patients, our employees in China and several other countries in the Asia-Pacific region have been restricted to working from home, and therefore have not been able to conduct business that requires them to be on-site, such as site visits to hospitals where our clinical trials are being conducted. Furthermore, travel by our employees to and within China and other countries in the region has been similarly restricted. There can be no assurances how long these restrictions will remain in place. As a result of this disruption, we expect that some revenues associated with our Asia-Pacific operations will be delayed or foregone and our results of operations for the Asia-Pacific region for the quarter ending March 31, 2020 could be negatively affected.\nAt this point in time, there is significant uncertainty relating to the potential effect of the novel coronavirus on our business. Infections may become more widespread, including to other countries where we have operations, and travel restrictions may remain or worsen, all of which would have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe biopharmaceutical services industry is highly competitive and our business could be materially impacted if we do not compete effectively.\nThe biopharmaceutical services industry is highly competitive. Our business often competes with other biopharmaceutical services companies, internal discovery departments, development departments, sales and marketing departments, information technology departments, and other departments within our customers, some of which could be considered large biopharmaceutical services companies in their own right with greater resources than ours. To the extent that our clients choose to internally perform the clinical development and commercialization tasks that we provide, our business will suffer. We also compete with universities, teaching hospitals, governmental agencies, and others. If we do not compete successfully, our business will suffer. The industry is highly fragmented, with numerous smaller specialized companies and a handful of companies with global capabilities similar to certain of our own capabilities. Increased competition has led to price and other forms of competition (such as acceptance of less favorable contract terms) that could adversely affect our operating results. There are few barriers to entry for companies considering offering\nany one or more of the services we offer. Because of their size and focus, these companies might compete effectively against us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIn recent years, our industry has experienced increased consolidation which may continue and might put us at risk of growing more slowly than our competitors that make acquisitions. This trend is likely to produce more competition from the resulting larger companies, and ones without the cost pressures of being public, for both customers and acquisition candidates. One specific aspect of this consolidation competition involves CROs entering into transactions to attempt to control more access to clinical trial participants, like acquisition of site networks and data. These trends could make it harder for us to compete successfully.\nOur future growth and success will depend on our ability to successfully compete with other companies that provide similar services in the same markets, some of which may have financial, marketing, technical, and other advantages. We also expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of consolidation among these various companies. Large technology companies with substantial resources, technical expertise, and greater brand power could also decide to enter or further expand in the markets where our business operates and compete with us. If one or more of our competitors or potential competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, or if a new entrant emerged with substantial resources, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. We compete on the basis of various factors, including breadth and depth of services, reputation, reliability, quality, innovation, security, price, and industry expertise and experience. In addition, our ability to compete successfully may be impacted by the growing availability of health information from social media, government health information systems, and other free or low-cost sources. In addition, consolidation or integration of wholesalers, retail pharmacies, health networks, payers, or other healthcare stakeholders may lead any of them to provide information services directly to customers or indirectly through a designated service provider, resulting in increased competition from firms that may have lower costs to market (e.g., no data supply costs). Any of the above may result in lower demand for our services, which could result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nOutsourcing trends in the biopharmaceutical industry and changes in aggregate spending and research and development budgets could adversely affect our operating results and growth rate.\nOur revenues depend on the level of R&D and commercialization expenditures, size of the drug-development pipelines, and outsourcing trends of the biopharmaceutical industry, including the amount of such R&D and commercialization spend that is outsourced and subject to competitive bidding amongst us and our competitors. Accordingly, economic factors and industry trends that affect biopharmaceutical companies affect our business.\nBiopharmaceutical companies continue to seek long-term strategic collaborations with global CROs with favorable pricing terms. Competition for these collaborations is intense and we might not be selected, in which case a competitor may enter into the collaboration and our business with the customer, if any, may be limited. Our success depends in part on our ability to establish and maintain preferred provider relationships with large biopharmaceutical companies. Our failure to develop or maintain these preferred provider relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Furthermore, in order to obtain preferred provider relationships or other large contracts for commercialization services, we may have to reduce the prices for our services, which could negatively impact our gross margin for these services.\nOur small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical company clients may rely on funding from venture capital and other sources to drive their business. To the extent that this funding is reduced, our small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical company clients may be forced to reduce their outsourced R&D and commercialization expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, if the biopharmaceutical industry reduces its outsourcing of clinical trials or commercialization services or such outsourcing fails to grow at projected rates, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We may also be negatively impacted by consolidation and other factors in the biopharmaceutical industry, which may slow decision making by our customers, result in the delay or cancellation of existing projects, cause reductions in overall R&D expenditures, or lead to increased pricing pressures. Further, in the event that one of our customers combines with a company that is using the services of one of our competitors, the combined company could decide to\nuse the services of that competitor or another provider. All of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nActions by government regulators or customers to limit a prescription\u2019s scope or withdraw an approved product from the market could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nGovernment regulators have the authority, after approving a biopharmaceutical product, to limit its indicated use, impose restrictions on its marketing, or withdraw it from the market completely based on safety or other concerns. Similarly, customers may act to voluntarily limit the sales of biopharmaceutical products or withdraw them from the market. Actions by payers to limit a product on a formulary list can influence customer decisions to withdraw or limit market support for a product. In the past, we have provided services with respect to products that have been limited or withdrawn. If we are providing services to customers for products that are limited or withdrawn, we may be required to narrow the scope of or terminate our services with respect to such products, which would prevent us from earning the full amount of revenues anticipated under the related contracts with negative impacts to our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nIf we fail to comply with federal, state, and foreign healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects could be adversely affected.\nEven though we do not and will not order healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse are and will be applicable to our business. We could be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws of both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exceptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our financial results, and our reputation.\nWe may be affected by healthcare reform and potential additional reforms which may adversely impact the biopharmaceutical industry and reduce the need for our services or negatively impact our profitability.\nNumerous government bodies are considering or have adopted healthcare reforms and may undertake, or are in the process of undertaking, efforts to control healthcare costs through legislation, regulation, and agreements with healthcare providers and biopharmaceutical companies, including many of our customers. As governmental administrations change and reforms take place, we are unable to predict what legislative proposals, if any, will be adopted in the future. If regulatory cost-containment efforts limit the profitability of new drugs by, for example, continuing to place downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and/or increasing regulatory burdens and operating costs of the biopharmaceutical industry, our customers may reduce their commercialization and R&D spending, which could reduce the business they outsource to us. In addition, if regulatory requirements are relaxed or simplified drug approval procedures are adopted, the demand for our services could decrease.\nGovernment bodies have adopted and may continue to adopt new healthcare legislation or regulations that are more burdensome than existing regulations. For example, product safety concerns and recommendations by the Drug Safety Oversight Board could change the regulatory environment for drug products, and new or heightened regulatory requirements may increase our expenses or limit our ability to offer some of our services. We might have to incur additional costs to comply with these or other new regulations, and failure to comply could harm our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and reputation, and result in adverse legal action(s). Additionally, new or heightened regulatory requirements may have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to conduct industry-sponsored clinical trials, which could reduce the need for our post-approval development services.\nCurrent and proposed laws and regulations regarding the protection of personal data could result in increased risks of liability or increased cost to us or could limit our service offerings.\nThe confidentiality, collection, use, and disclosure of personal data, including clinical trial information, are subject to governmental regulation. In addition, the United States, the EU and its member states, and other countries where we have operations, including but not limited to Japan, China, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Russia, and Singapore, continue to issue new privacy and data protection laws, rules, and regulations that relate to personal data and health information. Federal, state, and foreign governments may propose or have adopted additional legislation governing the collection, possession, use, storage, or disclosure of personal data, including but not limited to personal health information, and personal financial data, as well as security breach notification rules for loss or theft of such data. Additional legislation or regulation of this type might, among other things, require us to implement additional security measures and processes or to anonymize or de-identify health or other personal data in excess of what we are already obliged to do, each of which may require substantial expenditures or limit our ability to offer some of our services. Failure to comply with these data protection and privacy laws, rules, and regulations, or to resolve any privacy or security complaints, could subject us to regulatory sanctions, fines, delays in clinical trials, criminal prosecution, or civil liability, as well as reputational damage.\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has promulgated rules under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (\u201cHITECH\u201d) Act in connection with the application of security and privacy provisions under the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (\"HIPAA\"). We are subject to similar privacy laws in Canada (the Federal Personal Information and Electronic Documents Act, the Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector, and the Personal Health Information Protection Act) and in the EEA (the GDPR). We are also subject to applicable U.S. state privacy and data security laws and regulations in the states in which we operate, such as the new California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\") effective as of January 2020. The CCPA provides for a private right of action for unauthorized access, theft or disclosure of personal information in certain situations with possible damage awards of $100 to $750 per consumer per incident, or actual damages, whichever is greater, and also permits class action lawsuits. In order to comply with such laws, we may incur substantial expenses, which may divert resources from other initiatives and projects, and could limit the services we are able to offer.\nHIPAA generally requires individuals' written authorization, in addition to any required informed consent, before protected health information (\"PHI\") may be used for research and such regulations specify standards for de-identification and for limitation of data collected. We are indirectly affected by the privacy provisions surrounding individual authorizations because many principal investigators with whom we are involved in clinical trials are directly subject to them as HIPAA \"covered entities.\" In addition, we obtain identifiable health information from third parties that are subject to such regulations. While we are not, as part of our core business, a \"Business Associate\" under HIPAA, regulatory agencies may disagree; Business Associates are subject to the requirements of HIPAA. As well, there are certain instances of our operations where we are, in fact, a Business Associate and are therefore subject to the foregoing HIPAA regulations. Because of amendments to the HIPAA data security and privacy rules, HIPAA Business Associates of a \"Covered Entity\" may be directly liable for breaches of PHI and other HIPAA violations. These amendments may subject Business Associates to HIPAA's enforcement scheme, which, as amended, can yield up to $1.5 million in annual civil penalties for each HIPAA violation. However, a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards, leading to possible penalties in excess of $1.68 million per calendar year. In certain circumstances, violations of HIPAA can also result in criminal penalties with fines up to $250,000 per violation and/or imprisonment.\nIn the EU, personal data includes any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person such as an employee, customer contact, business supplier, and patient or clinical trial participant, with health, genetic, biometric data; other \"Sensitive\" personal information, such as genetic information/data carry additional obligations, which may include obtaining explicit consent from the individual for collection, use, or disclosure of the Sensitive personal information. The GDPR came into effect on May 25, 2018, replacing the existing EU data protection framework. The GDPR contains new provisions specifically directed at the processing of health information, rights of data subjects, data breach notification, and extra-territoriality measures intended to bring non-EU companies under the GDPR (where those companies are targeting or monitoring individuals located in the EU). Failure by us, our customers, our partners, our service providers, or\nour employees or contractors to comply with the GDPR could result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage, orders to cease/ change our use of data, enforcement notices and/ or fines of the greater of 20,000,000 Euros or 4% of total global annual revenue, as well as potential civil claims including class actions where individuals suffer harm.\nIn addition, we are subject to EU rules with respect to cross-border transfers of such data out of the EU and EEA. Where we transfer personal data out of the EU and EEA, we utilize a transfer mechanism deemed adequate by the EU, including the standard data protection clauses approved by the EU Commission for the transfer of personal data to countries not deemed by the EU to have an adequate level of data protection (i.e., the standard contractual clauses) or by way of an alternative transfer mechanism permitted under EU law. For example, certain of our clinical entities participate in the E.U.-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shields and comply with the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the EU, United Kingdom, or Switzerland, as applicable, to the United States. There is currently ongoing litigation in the EU challenging the validity of the standard contractual clauses as an adequate data transfer mechanism under the GDPR. As such, it is uncertain whether the standard contractual clauses may be invalidated as an adequate data transfer mechanism in the near future. Additionally, the EU has the ability to invalidate the Privacy Shield frameworks just as it did with the former Safe Harbor framework. These changes and ongoing scrutiny of transfer mechanisms generally may require us to find alternative bases for the compliant transfer of personal data outside the EEA and to make changes to our cross-border data transfer processes.\nWhen acting as a data controller, we will be accountable for any third party service providers we engage to process personal data on our behalf. There is no assurance that contractual measures and our own privacy and security-related safeguards will protect us from the risks associated with the third-party processing, storage and transmission of such information. Any violation of data or security laws by our third party processors could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in the fines and penalties outlined above.\nOur customers face intense competition from lower cost generic products and other competing products, which may lower the amount that they spend on our services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nOur customers face increasing competition from competing products and, in particular, from lower cost generic products, which in turn may affect their ability to pursue clinical development and commercialization activities. In the United States, the EU and Japan, political pressure to reduce spending on prescription products has led to legislation and other measures which encourage the use of generic products. In addition, proposals emerge from time to time in the United States and other countries for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic products. Loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by generic substitutes, reducing our customers\u2019 sales of that product and their overall profitability. Availability of generic substitutes for our customers\u2019 products or other competing products may cause them to lose market share and, as a result, may adversely affect their results of operations and cash flow, which in turn may mean that they would not have adequate capital to purchase our services. If competition from generic or other products impacts our customers\u2019 finances such that they decide to curtail our services, our net revenues may decline and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf we do not keep pace with rapid technological change, our services may become less competitive or obsolete.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry generally, and drug development and clinical research more specifically, are subject to rapid technological change. Our current competitors or other businesses might develop technologies or services that are more effective or commercially attractive than, or render obsolete, our current or future technologies and services. If our competitors introduce superior technologies or services and if we cannot make enhancements to remain competitive, our competitive position would be harmed. If we are unable to compete successfully, we may lose customers or be unable to attract new customers, which could lead to a decrease in our revenue and have an adverse impact on our financial condition.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and we might be involved in costly intellectual property lawsuits.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry has a history of intellectual property litigation and these lawsuits will likely continue in the future. Accordingly, we may face patent infringement suits or be called upon to provide documentation by companies that have patents for similar business processes or other suits alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights. Legal proceedings relating to intellectual property could be expensive, take significant time, and divert management's attention from other business concerns, regardless of the outcome of the litigation. In the event an infringement lawsuit were brought against us and we did not prevail, we might have to pay substantial damages and we could be required to stop infringing activity or obtain a license to use technology on unfavorable terms.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial debt could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our total principal amount of indebtedness was $2.68 billion, which consisted of: (i) a $1.55 billion Term Loan A facility; (ii) a $795.6 million Term Loan B facility; (iii) borrowings of $275.0 million under our accounts receivable financing agreement; and (iv) $54.7 million in current and non-current finance lease obligations. Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations and thus make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our senior secured facilities. If our cash flow is not sufficient to service our debt and adequately fund our business, we may be required to seek further additional financing or refinancing or dispose of assets. We might not be able to influence any of these alternatives on satisfactory terms or at all. Our substantial indebtedness could also:\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic, industry, or competitive developments;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a more substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, investments, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limit our ability to make required payments under our existing contractual commitments, including our existing long-term indebtedness;\n\u2022limit our ability to fund a change of control offer;\n\u2022require us to sell certain assets;\n\u2022restrict us from making strategic investments, including acquisitions, or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022cause us to incur substantial fees from time to time in connection with debt amendments or refinancings;\n\u2022increase our exposure to rising interest rates because a substantial portion of our borrowings is at variable interest rates; and\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds or to borrow on terms that are satisfactory to us.\nDespite our level of indebtedness, we are able to incur more debt and undertake additional obligations. Incurring such debt or undertaking such additional obligations could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition.\nWe also may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future. Although covenants under our Credit Agreement limit our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. To the extent we incur additional indebtedness, the risks associated with our leverage, including our possible inability to service our debt obligations, would increase.\nServicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and refinance our debt, make strategic acquisitions, and fund capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash flow in the future. To some extent, our ability to generate future cash flow is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that:\n\u2022our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations;\n\u2022we will continue to realize the cost savings, revenue growth, and operating improvements that resulted from the execution of our long-term strategic plan; or\n\u2022future sources of funding will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs.\nWe also may experience difficulties repatriating cash from foreign subsidiaries and accounts due to law, regulation, or contracts which could further constrain our liquidity. If we cannot fund our liquidity needs, we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, marketing efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt, or seeking additional equity capital. We cannot assure you that any of these remedies could, if necessary, be effected on commercially reasonable or favorable terms, or at all, or that they would permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our debt on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nCovenant restrictions under our Credit Agreement and lease agreement may limit our ability to operate our business.\nOur Credit Agreement contains covenants that may restrict our ability to, among other things, borrow money, pay dividends, make capital expenditures, make strategic acquisitions and effect a consolidation, merger or disposal of all or substantially all of our assets. Although the covenants in our Credit Agreement are subject to various exceptions, we cannot assure you that these covenants will not adversely affect our ability to finance future operations, capital needs, or to engage in other activities that may be in our best interest. In addition, in certain circumstances, our long-term debt requires us to maintain a specified financial ratio and satisfy certain financial condition tests, which may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our senior secured facilities. If an event of default under our Credit Agreement occurs, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all amounts outstanding, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. In such case, we might not have sufficient funds to repay all the outstanding amounts. In addition, our Credit Agreement is secured by first priority security interests on substantially all of our real and personal property, including the capital stock of certain of our subsidiaries. If an event of default under our Credit Agreement occurs, the lenders thereunder could exercise their rights under the related security documents. Any acceleration of amounts due under our Credit Agreement or the substantial exercise by the lenders of their rights under the security documents would likely have a material adverse effect on us.\nUnder the terms of the lease agreement for our corporate headquarters in Morrisville, North Carolina we may be required to issue a letter of credit (\"LOCs\") to the landlord based on our debt rating issued by Moody\u2019s Investors Service (or other nationally-recognized debt rating agency). From June 14, 2017 through June 14, 2020, if our debt rating is Ba3 or better, no LOC is required, or if our debt rating is B1 or lower, a LOC equal to 25% of the remaining minimum annual rent and estimated operating expenses (or a LOC of approximately $22.5 million as of December 31, 2019) is required to be issued to the landlord. This LOC would remain in effect until our debt rating increased to Ba3 or higher for a twelve-month period. After June 14, 2020, if our debt rating is Ba2 or better, no LOC is required; if our debt rating is Ba3 or lower, a LOC equal to 25% of the then remaining minimum annual rent and estimated operating expenses is required to be issued to the landlord (estimated at approximately $21.8 million as of December 31, 2019); or if our debt rating is B1 or lower, a LOC equal to 100% of the then remaining minimum annual rent and estimated operating expenses is required to be issued to the landlord (estimated at approximately $87.3 million as of December 31, 2019). These letters of credit would remain in effect until our debt rating is back above the required threshold for a twelve-month period.\nAs of December 31, 2019 (and through the date of this filing), our debt rating was such that no LOC is currently required. Any letters of credit issued in accordance with the aforementioned requirements could be issued under our revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement (\"Revolver\"), and would reduce our available borrowing capacity by the same amount accordingly.\nInterest rate fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nBecause we have substantial variable rate debt, fluctuations in interest rates may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. We currently utilize interest rate swaps to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations; however, such instruments may not be effective. At December 31, 2019, we had approximately $2.68 billion of total principal indebtedness consisting of $2.35 billion in term loan debt, borrowings of $275.0 million under our accounts receivable financing agreement, and $54.7 million in current and non-current of finance lease obligations, of which $1.67 billion was subject to variable interest rates.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price is subject to volatility, which could have a material adverse impact on investors and employee retention.\nSince our initial public offering in November 2014 (the \"IPO\"), the price of our stock, as reported by Nasdaq, has ranged from a low of $19.61 on November 7, 2014 to a high of $65.17 on January 24, 2020. In addition, securities markets worldwide have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could affect stock price in ways that may be unrelated to our operating performance. The trading price of our stock is subject to significant price fluctuations in response to many factors, including:\n\u2022market conditions or trends in our industry, including with respect to the regulatory environment, or the economy as a whole;\n\u2022fluctuations in quarterly operating results, as well as differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors, especially as we integrate inVentiv into our company;\n\u2022future performance guidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet this guidance;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our stock, our failure to meet those estimates or the failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our stock;\n\u2022changes in key personnel;\n\u2022entry into new markets;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of new service offerings or significant acquisitions, divestitures, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022actions by competitors;\n\u2022changes in operating performance and market valuations of other companies in the industry;\n\u2022investors' perceptions of our prospects and the prospects of the industry;\n\u2022investors' perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our stock relative to other investment alternatives;\n\u2022the public's reaction to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022announcements related to litigation;\n\u2022changes in the credit ratings of our debt;\n\u2022the sustainability of an active trading market for our stock;\n\u2022future sales of our stock by our significant shareholders, officers, and directors; and\n\u2022other events or factors, including those resulting from system failures and disruptions, cyber-attacks, earthquakes, hurricanes, war, acts of terrorism, other natural disasters, or responses to these events.\nThese and other factors may cause the market price and demand for shares of our stock to fluctuate substantially, which could result in reduced liquidity and a decline in the price of our stock. When the market price of a stock is volatile, security holders often institute class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If we become involved in this type of litigation, regardless of the outcome, we could incur substantial legal costs and our management's attention could be diverted from the operation of our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends to holders of our stock for the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors (the \"Board\") and will depend on our financial condition, capital requirements, legal requirements, earnings, and other factors. Our ability to pay dividends is restricted by the terms of our Credit Agreement and might be restricted by the terms of any indebtedness that we incur in the future. Consequently, you should not rely on dividends in order to receive a return on your investment.\nFuture sales of our stock in the public market could cause the market price of our stock to decrease significantly.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had 103,865,770 outstanding shares of Class A common stock. In addition, we had 3,535,553 shares of outstanding stock options and restricted stock units that, if exercised or sold, would result in these additional shares becoming available for sale subject, in some cases, to Rule 144 and Rule 701 under the Securities Act. Our private equity sponsors (the \u201cSponsors\u201d) together own approximately 40% of our outstanding shares and have contractual rights to cause us to register resales of those shares.\nSales or issuances of substantial amounts of our stock in the public market by us or our shareholders may cause the market price of our stock to decrease significantly. The perception that such sales or issuances could occur could also depress the market price of our stock. Any such sales or issuances could also create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and might also make it more difficult for us to raise capital through the sale of equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nOur Sponsors have significant influence over our company, and their interests may be different from or conflict with those of our other shareholders.\nOur Sponsors collectively beneficially own approximately 40% of our outstanding common stock. As a consequence, the Sponsors continue to be able to exert a significant degree of influence over our management, affairs, and matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and any other significant transaction. Additionally, each of the Sponsors is party to a stockholders agreement with us (the \"Stockholders Agreements\"). The Stockholders Agreements, among other things, each requires such shareholders to vote in favor of certain nominees to our Board. The interests of the Sponsors might not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other shareholders. For instance, this concentration of ownership and/or the restrictions imposed by the Stockholders Agreements may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us otherwise favored by our other shareholders and could depress our stock price.\nThe Sponsors each make investments in companies and may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Each of the Sponsors may also pursue, for its own account, acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities might not be available to us. Our organizational documents contain provisions renouncing any interest or expectancy held by our directors affiliated with the Sponsors in certain corporate opportunities. Accordingly, the interests of the Sponsors may supersede ours, causing the Sponsors or their affiliates to compete against us or to pursue opportunities instead of us, for which we have no recourse. Such actions on the part of the Sponsors and inaction on our part could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Sponsors control four seats on our Board. Since the Sponsors could invest in entities that directly or indirectly compete with us, when conflicts arise between the interests of the Sponsors and the interests of our shareholders, these directors might not be disinterested.\nProvisions of our corporate governance documents and Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult and may prevent attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management, even if beneficial to our shareholders.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that delay, defer or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control of us or change in our management that shareholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our stock, thereby depressing the market price of our stock. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for shareholders to replace members of the Board. Because the Board is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt to replace current members of our management team. Among others, these provisions include: (i) our ability to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval; (ii) the requirement that our shareholders may not act without a meeting; (iii) requirements for advance notification of shareholder nominations and proposals contained in our bylaws; (iv) the absence of cumulative voting for our directors; (v) requirements for shareholder approval of certain business combinations; and (vi) the limitations on director nominations contained in our Stockholders Agreement.\nAdditionally, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \"DGCL\") prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the Merger in which the person became an interested shareholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The existence of the foregoing provision could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our stock, thereby depressing the market price of our stock.\nIf securities analysts or industry analysts downgrade our shares, publish negative research or reports, or do not publish reports about our business, stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our stock is to some extent influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us, our business and our industry. If one or more analysts adversely change their recommendation regarding our shares or our competitors' stock, our share price would likely decline. If one or more analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we might lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nWe are incurring increased costs and obligations as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with certain additional corporate governance and financial reporting practices and policies. As a result, due to compliance requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"Sarbanes-Oxley\"), the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq, and other applicable securities rules and regulations, we have and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and operating results with the SEC. We are also required to ensure that we have the ability to prepare financial statements and other disclosures that are fully compliant with all SEC reporting requirements on a timely basis. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and may continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, or costly, and increase demand on our systems and resources.\nWe might not be successful in complying with these requirements and the significant amount of resources required to ensure compliance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe outcome of the putative class action lawsuit filed against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows.\nOn February 21, 2019, the SEC notified us that it has commenced an investigation into our revenue accounting policies, internal controls and related matters, and requested that we retain certain documents for the periods beginning with January 1, 2017. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors subsequently initiated an independent review of our revenue accounting policies, internal controls, and related matters with the assistance of outside counsel and accounting advisors, which is now complete. On August 26, 2019, the SEC Staff notified our outside counsel that it had concluded its investigation and, based on the information provided to the SEC as such date, does not intend to recommend an enforcement action against us.\nOn March 1, 2019, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey on behalf of a putative class of shareholders who purchased our common stock during the period between May 10, 2017 and February 27, 2019. The complaint names us and certain of our executive officers as defendants and allege violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, based on allegedly false or misleading statements about our business, operations, and prospects. The plaintiffs seek awards of compensatory damages, among other relief, and their costs and attorneys\u2019 and experts\u2019 fees.\nWe are presently unable to predict the duration, scope or result of this putative class action, or any other related lawsuit or investigation.\nThe outcome of the putative class action litigation or any other litigation is necessarily uncertain. We could be forced to expend significant resources in the defense of this lawsuit or future ones, and we may not prevail. We also have incurred additional expenses related to remedial measures, including those that we implemented in response to our conclusion that our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.\nOur internal control over financial reporting is required to meet all the standards of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, and failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our stock price, reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSection 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley requires management and our independent registered public accounting firm to assess and attest to the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. The rules governing the standards that must be met to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing, and possible remediation of our existing controls and could result in incurring significant additional expenditures. We are required to design, implement, and test our internal control over financial reporting in order to comply with this obligation. The effort necessary to meet these requirements is time consuming, costly, and complicated, and we must continually evaluate and refine these processes on an ongoing basis. We might encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any required improvements and therefore fail to receive a favorable attestation provided by our independent registered public accounting firm.\nFurther, material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting have existed in the past. For example, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, we concluded that material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting existed as of December 31, 2018. These material weaknesses have since been remediated, but additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may be discovered in the future. If we fail to maintain an effective internal control environment, such failure could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely, resulting in misstatements and/or restatements of our consolidated financial statements, which may cause investors to lose confidence and have a material adverse effect on our stock price, reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are a holding company and rely on dividends and other payments, advances, and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations and pay any dividends.\nWe have no direct operations and no significant assets other than ownership of 100% of the capital stock of our subsidiaries. Because we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries, we depend on those entities for dividends and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations, and to pay any dividends with respect to our stock. Legal and contractual restrictions in our Credit Agreement and other agreements which may govern future indebtedness of our subsidiaries, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries, may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. The earnings from, or other available assets of, our subsidiaries might not be sufficient to pay dividends, make distributions, or loans to enable us to pay any dividends on our stock or other obligations. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 15071, "SIC": 8731, "TIC": "SYNH"}
