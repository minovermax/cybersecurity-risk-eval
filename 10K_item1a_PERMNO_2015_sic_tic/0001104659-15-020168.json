{"cik": "104777", "company": "ALTEVA, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nRISK FACTORS\nWe have a history of operating losses and there is no assurance we will generate profits in the future.\nWe have a history of operating losses. We have sustained operating losses of $6.6 million and $11.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We cannot assure that we will be able to generate profitable operations in the future. If we cannot generate profits in the future, our failure to do so could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to raise additional equity capital or to incur additional debt.\nAny impairment of goodwill, other intangible assets or long-lived assets could negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and, along with other intangible assets or long-lived assets, is also tested whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill, intangible assets and/or long-lived assets may be impaired. Any excess goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets value resulting from the impairment test must be written off in the period of determination. Intangible assets (other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets) and other long-lived assets are generally amortized or depreciated over the useful life of such assets. In addition, from time to time, we may acquire or make an investment in a business that will require us to record goodwill based on the purchase price and the value of the acquired tangible and intangible assets. We significantly increased our goodwill as a result of our acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Alteva, LLC. We may subsequently experience unforeseen issues with the businesses we acquire, which may adversely affect the anticipated returns of the business or value of the intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets for such business. Likewise, our Telephone segment has continued to decline in revenue. Further declines in revenue could cause a future impairment of long-lived assets in the Telephone segment. Future determinations of significant write-offs of goodwill, intangible assets or other long-lived assets, as a result of an impairment test or any accelerated amortization or depreciation of other intangible assets or other long-lived assets could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We have completed our annual impairment test for goodwill in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, and have concluded that we do not have any impairment of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nWe are subject to competition that may adversely impact us.\nThe UC market is also becoming increasingly competitive as large and small providers grow more sophisticated in their UC product offerings. We cannot predict the number of competitors that will ultimately emerge, but increased competition from existing and new entities could have an adverse effect on our business. In our Telephone segment, we historically faced little competition in our markets. As a direct result of deregulation, we now face direct competition in our traditional ILEC territories by CLEC operations and other providers of telecommunications services that offer comparable voice, video and data products. The primary competitor in our market has brand recognition and financial, personnel, marketing and other resources that are significantly greater than ours. In addition, consolidations and strategic alliances within the telecommunications industry, as well as ongoing technological innovation, are likely to increase competition in our market. With increased substitution of wireless for landline services, wireless carriers are now competing aggressively for our voice customers.\nA significant portion of our cash flows were derived from our O-P Limited Partnership.\nHistorically, we relied significantly on income derived from our partnership interest in the O-P. We previously received quarterly cash distributions from the O-P, which comprised a substantial percentage of our cash flows. On April 30, 2014 we exercised our Put right pursuant to the 4G Agreement, and as a result will have no further distributions from the O-P. Failure to generate positive cash flows from our operations in the future could adversely impact the Company.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in previous years that have been remediated. We can provide no assurance that further material weaknesses will not be identified in the future.\nEffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent or detect fraud. We had previous material weaknesses related to controls around financial reporting with respect to our application of U.S. GAAP for income taxes, related to cash flow presentation for equity investments and controls around the reporting of deferred income taxes identified in connection with the restatement of our financial statements that have been remediated as of December 31, 2014. Should we identify any other material weaknesses, such weaknesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as impair our ability to meet the reporting requirements under the securities laws in a timely manner. These effects could in turn adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and could result in a material misstatement of our financial position or results of operations and require a further restatement of our financial statements.\nOur business and stock price may be adversely affected if our internal controls are not effective.\nEffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent or detect fraud.\nAlthough we believe we have taken the appropriate actions to remediate the material weaknesses, we cannot give assurances that we will not discover other material weaknesses in the future or that no material weakness will result from any difficulties, errors, delays or disruptions while we implement and transition to new internal systems. The existence of one or more material weaknesses could result in errors in our financial statements, and substantial costs and resources may be required to rectify these or other internal control deficiencies. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly, we may be unable to obtain additional financing to operate and expand our business, and our business and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe rely on licensed technology to offer our Unified Communication services.\nWe rely on licensed technology to provide UC services to customers. If we were unable to continue licensing technology from Broadsoft or Microsoft, we would need to transfer our UC services to a new technology platform. This could disrupt our service, require us to incur significant transition costs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe rely on access to the Internet to offer our Unified Communication services.\nWe rely on access to the Internet to provide UC services to customers that is provided by third-parties. Our business may be adversely impacted if these third-party providers experience outages or if they encounter financial difficulties. These third-party providers may also raise rates that we may not be able to pass through to our customers, which could impact profitability.\nAny inability to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets could allow our competitors and others to produce competing products based on our proprietary information.\nOur success depends more on the knowledge, ability, experience and technological expertise of our employees than on the legal protection of patents and other proprietary rights. We claim proprietary rights in various unpatented technologies, know-how, trade secrets and trademarks relating to the services we offer. We cannot guarantee the degree of protection these various claims may or will afford, or that competitors will not independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology. We protect our proprietary rights in our products and operations through contractual obligations, including nondisclosure agreements with certain employees, customers, consultants and strategic partners. There can be no assurance as to the degree of protection these contractual measures may or will afford.\nWe may seek to make strategic acquisitions and enter into strategic alliances. Acquisitions and strategic alliances involve additional risks that may adversely affect us.\nFrom time to time, we may seek to make strategic acquisitions and enter into strategic alliances that expand our portfolio of services. We may be unable to complete these strategic transactions if suitable businesses that add value are not available at favorable prices due to increased competition for these businesses.\nWe may have to borrow money, incur liabilities, or sell or issue stock to pay for future strategic opportunities and we may not be able to do so on terms favorable to us, or at all. Additional borrowings and liabilities may have a materially adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources. If we issue stock for all or a portion of the purchase price for future acquisitions, our stockholders\u2019 interest may be diluted.\nCompleting strategic transactions involves a number of risks, including diverting management\u2019s attention from our daily operations, other additional management, operational and financial resources, system conversions and the inability to maintain key pre-acquisition relationships with customers, suppliers and employees. We might not be able to successfully integrate future transactions into our business or operate the businesses profitably, and we may be subject to unanticipated problems and liabilities.\nIf we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends, or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States, and similar laws in other countries, and non-disclosure, confidentiality and other types of agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish, maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights. Despite these measures, any of our direct or indirect intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly software redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitive harm. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third party copying, infringement or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. Also, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the telecommunications industry, much of our UC business and many of our UC products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms.\nIn addition, third parties may claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Such claims may be made by competitors seeking to block or limit our access to telecommunications markets. Additionally, in recent years, individuals and groups have begun purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies. Even if we believe that the claims are without merit, the claims can be time consuming and costly to defend and distract management\u2019s attention and resources.\nClaims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products. Even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations. If we cannot or do not license the infringed technology at all, license the technology on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source, our revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted. Finally, we use open source software in connection with our products and services. Companies that incorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software and/or compliance with open source license terms. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or noncompliance with open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. Any requirement to disclose our source code or pay damages for breach of contract could be harmful to our business results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate new technologies, respond effectively to customer requirements or provide new services.\nThe communications industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technology, the development of new types of content, frequent new service offerings and a changing regulatory and economic environment. We cannot predict the changes in our competitive position or profitability. Technological developments may reduce the competitiveness of our networks and require significant expenditures of capital to upgrade and/or replace outdated technologies. In addition, new products and services arising out of technological developments in the industry may reduce the attractiveness of our products and services. If we fail to adapt successfully to technological changes or obsolescence, or fail to obtain access to important new technologies or content, we could lose existing customers and fail to attract new customers. Our UC business currently depends on the use of desktop telephones and related systems. The rise of social media and soft phones in the future could potentially reduce the use of desktop telephones, which could have an adverse effect on our UC business. A key element of our long-term growth strategy is our ability to deliver new and enhanced products and services to our customers. The successful delivery of new products and services is uncertain and dependent on many factors. There is no guarantee that delivery of these services will generate the anticipated increase in customers and revenues.\nWe provide services to customers over access lines. If access lines continue to decline, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur Telephone segment generates revenues by delivering voice and data services over access lines. We continue to experience access\nline losses due to competition from wireless and broadband service providers. For example, access lines declined 9% in 2014 and 8% in 2013. We may continue to experience access line losses in our primary markets. Our inability to retain access lines could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nReductions in USF funding and intercarrier compensation may negatively impact our financial results. Additional regulatory changes may have a material adverse effect on our operations as well.\nWe operate in a heavily regulated industry. A significant portion of the revenues in our Telephone segment has generally been supported by regulations that provide for local and network access revenues and USF funds. Changes in the funding and/or payout rules for the USF will further reduce our revenues obtained from the USF and we may not be able to replace this lost revenue.\nOn November 28, 2011, the FCC released a comprehensive order regarding reform of the Universal Service Fund and Intercarrier Compensation (\u201cICC\u201d). The order specified that the USF would be renamed the Connect America Fund (\u201cCAF\u201d). Funds from CAF will be allocated with a greater emphasis on stimulating broadband build out in the United States. Additionally, the order mandated a decline in overall revenues deemed interstate. Currently these revenues are received from end users, interexchange carriers and the USF. The total of these revenues will decline 5% a year and the USF or CAF support must decline accordingly. This change commenced on July 1, 2012 and will continue annually for the next 10 years.\nFinally, the order contains a provision that implements a \u201cceiling\u201d on the amount of corporate overhead expenses that can be recovered by an ILEC through CAF. Historically, the USF fund has allowed ILECs to recover their reasonable costs without restriction. In 2012, a ceiling was established based on corporate overhead cost per access line. Accordingly, we anticipate a significant reduction in funds that we are eligible to receive from the USF. This reduction in USF revenue is expected to significantly impact our revenues and financial results over the next several years.\nOn November 28, 2011, the FCC released a comprehensive order concerning Intercarrier Compensation. The order reflected the FCC\u2019s desire for telephone companies to eventually eliminate intercarrier compensation altogether. To implement this, the FCC has mandated that companies lower their access rates at the intrastate level to the interstate rate level by 2013 which we have complied with. In addition, a rate of return carrier, such as us, must reduce its rates for some access elements to zero within nine years. While this will be offset to some extent by additional end user charges (known as ARC or Access Recovery Charge), the overall effect will be a decline in revenue.\nAdditional regulatory changes could adversely impact the rates we are permitted to charge our customers, reduce payments to us from the USF or restrict our ability to effectively compete in the market place. Regulatory changes could also restrict our ability to secure new sources of capital and/or grow through strategic acquisitions or alliances. In addition, the failure of regulations to change in a manner that would establish an environment in which we may compete on more even terms with our actual economic competitors could also adversely affect our profitability.\nWe operate in a region that is subject to extreme weather. Such extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations and damage our property, which may have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe operate in the northeastern United States, a region that is subject to extreme weather conditions. Such extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations and damage our properties and equipment. Although we maintain insurance coverage for certain extreme weather conditions, such coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits, including limitation on the coverage period for business interruption, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to fully insure such losses or fully collect, if at all, on claims resulting from such extreme weather conditions. Although preventative measures may help mitigate the damage from such occurrences, the damage and disruption to our business resulting from any of these events may be significant. If our insurance and other risk mitigation mechanisms are not sufficient to recover all costs, including loss of revenues from sales to customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nThere is a history of disputes regarding intercarrier billing, which may materially impact our results of operations.\nWe are periodically involved in disputes related to our billings to other carriers for access to our network. In the event that a claim is made related to revenues previously recognized, we assess the validity of the claim and adjust the amount of revenue being recognized to the extent that the claim adjustment is considered probable and estimable. We are, in the ordinary course of business, billed certain charges from other carriers that we believe are either erroneous or relate to prior periods. We carefully review our vendor invoices and dispute inaccurate or inappropriate charges. In cases where we dispute certain charges, we frequently pay only undisputed amounts on vendor invoices. The amount of disputed charges may remain outstanding for some time pending resolution or compromise. We periodically review the outstanding disputes and reassess the likelihood of success in the event of the resolution of these disputes. However, it is possible that the actual settlement of any disputes will be material. In view of the length of time historically required to resolve these disputes, they may be resolved or require adjustment in future periods and relate to billings and or costs invoiced, which were either accrued or paid in prior periods.\nRisks associated with our unfunded pension and postretirement plan liabilities.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our unfunded pension liability was $8.1 million and our unfunded postretirement plan was $0.8 million. We believe our cash management and monitoring of our funds will allow us to adequately fund our pension and our postretirement plans.\nIf the stock market declines significantly or interest rates fluctuate or become volatile, it will be more difficult for us to adequately fund the plans. Although our plan assets increased in 2014, if market conditions result in a decrease in plan assets during 2015, required pension plan contributions may increase in 2016. In addition, if we only make the minimum required contributions over the next two years, required payments will increase to higher amounts than if we had funded more than the minimum in recent years.\nWe need to retain a highly skilled, technologically savvy workforce to compete in Unified Communications.\nTo succeed as a Unified Communication provider we must retain a highly skilled workforce. Our ability to retain and compete in the Unified Communications industry will require us to attract highly skilled technical personnel. We can provide no assurances that we can recruit this type of personnel. An inability to hire sufficient numbers of people or to find people with the desired skills could result in greater demands being placed on limited management resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nOur relationships with other communications companies are material to our operations.\nWe originate and terminate calls for long distance carriers and other interexchange carriers over our network and for that service we receive payments for access charges. These payments represent a significant portion of our revenues. Should these carriers go bankrupt or experience substantial financial difficulties, our inability to collect access charges from them could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations. Additionally, if these carriers experience outages, it could have a negative impact on our business.\nWe depend heavily on our senior management team and the loss of the services of one or more of our key executives or the unsuccessful implementation of our leadership transition could harm our business.\nOur success depends, in large part, on the skills, experience and efforts of our senior management team. We have undergone several changes with respect to our senior management team. These changes in key management could create uncertainty among our employees, customers and other third parties with which we do business, and could result in changes to the strategic direction of our business, financial condition and results of operations. The loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management team could significantly harm our business. In addition, we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of members of our senior management team. The loss of any member of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and reputation may be affected by our ability to keep clients\u2019 information confidential.\nOur business involves the use of private and confidential customer information, including customer credit card information. This information is critical to us receiving timely payment for our services from customers and may be transmitted to us via the Internet. While we have systems and processes in place to protect this information, there is no guarantee that our systems and processes are adequate to protect against all security breaches. If our systems are disrupted, fail for any reason, or are infiltrated by unauthorized persons, our customers could experience data or financial loss. Such events may expose us to unexpected liability, litigation, regulation, investigation and penalties, loss of customers\u2019 business and unfavorable impact to our business reputation, all of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWeak economic conditions may impact the demand for our services.\nWe could realize a change in demand for services due to the ongoing weak economic conditions. Downturns in the economy and continued competition in our markets may cause some of our existing customers to disconnect or scale back basic and enhanced services, broadband Internet or video service, and it may become more difficult for us to acquire new customers. Furthermore economic conditions may prolong our payment collections interval and in some cases increase our need to discontinue service for nonpayment.\nWe are evaluating strategic alternatives and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying a strategic alternative, that any such strategic alternative will enhance shareholder value, or that the process will not have an adverse impact on our business.\nIn January 2015, we announced that we retained Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. as our financial advisor to help evaluate strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value. No decision has been made to enter into any transaction at this time, and there can be no assurances that this evaluation will result in the completion of a transaction, or that any such transaction will enhance shareholder value. The process of exploring strategic alternatives may be time consuming, costly, and disruptive to our business operations and if we are unable to effectively manage the process, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Any strategic decision will involve risks and uncertainties, and we cannot assure you that any potential transaction or other strategic alternative, if identified, evaluated and consummated, will provide greater value to our shareholders than that reflected in the current stock price. Any potential transaction would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among other factors, market conditions, and industry trends. We do not intend to comment regarding the evaluation of strategic alternatives until such time as our board of directors has determined the outcome of the process or otherwise has deemed that disclosure is appropriate. As a consequence, perceived uncertainties related to our future may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings, adverse outcomes of which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe are party, from time to time, to various legal proceedings, including patent infringement claims, regulatory investigations and tax examinations incidental to our business. We continually monitor these legal proceedings, regulatory investigations and tax examinations to determine the impact and any required accruals. These legal proceedings could result in obligations that could have material adverse effect on our financial results. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcome of these proceedings, investigations and examinations and that the outcomes will not have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 86008, "SIC": 4813, "TIC": "ALTV"}
