{"cik": "709283", "company": "QUANTUM CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-06-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all other information in this Annual Report, before investing in any of our securities. The occurrence of any single risk or any combination of risks could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, liquidity, or competitive position, and consequently, the value of our securities. The material adverse effects include, but are not limited to, not growing our revenue or market share at the pace that they have grown historically or at all, our revenue and market share fluctuating on a quarterly and annual basis, an extension of our history of losses and a failure to become profitable, not achieving the revenue and net income (loss) guidance that we provide, and harm to our reputation and brand.\nThe recent COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread have impacted and will continue to impact our workforce and operations, and those of our strategic partners, customers, suppliers and logistics providers. These impacts have included and may include under-absorbed overhead, increased logistics and other costs and decreased product output. While our third-party partners are all currently operational, in some cases with exemptions from government restrictions, this is subject to change based on evolving conditions related to the pandemic.\nThe effects of the pandemic are uncertain and difficult to predict, but may include:\n\u2022\nFurther disruptions to our supply chain, our operations or those of our strategic partners, customers or suppliers caused by employees or others contracting COVID-19, or governmental orders to contain the spread of COVID-19 such as travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, trade controls, and business shutdowns;\n\u2022\nA global economic downturn or a recession causing a decrease in short- or long-term demand for our products, resulting in industry oversupply and decreases of average selling prices (\u201cASPs\u201d), which would negatively impact our sales and profitability;\n\u2022\nDeterioration of worldwide credit markets that may limit our ability or increase our cost to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures and result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivables due to customer credit defaults;\n\u2022\nExtreme volatility in financial markets which has and may continue to adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access the financial markets on acceptable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nIncreased data security and technology risk as many employees transition to work from home arrangements, including possible outages to systems and technologies critical to remote work and increased data privacy risk with cybercriminals attempting to take advantage of the disruption; and\n\u2022\nManagement\u2019s ongoing commitment of significant time, attention and resources to respond to the pandemic.\nThe degree to which the pandemic ultimately impacts our business and results of operations will depend on future developments beyond our control which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, including the severity and duration of the pandemic, the extent of actions to contain or treat COVID-19, the effectiveness of government stimulus programs, any possible resurgence of COVID-19 that may occur after the initial outbreak subsides, how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating activity can resume, and the severity and duration of the global economic downturn that results from the pandemic. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in more detail in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, such as those relating to adverse global or regional conditions, our highly competitive industry, supply chain disruption, customer demand conditions and our ability to forecast demand, cost saving initiatives, our indebtedness and liquidity, and cyber-attacks.\nWe have significant indebtedness, which imposes upon us debt service obligations, and our term loan and credit facility contains various operating and financial covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and overall results of operations to meet these debt obligations or remain in compliance with the covenants, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur level of indebtedness presents significant risks to our business and investors, both in terms of the constraints that it places on our ability to operate our business and because of the possibility that we may not generate\nsufficient cash and results of operations to remain in compliance with our covenants and pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it becomes due. We recently failed to meet certain financial covenants in our debt agreements, which could have resulted in a default under these agreements if we had not obtained a waiver of noncompliance from our lenders. For further description of our outstanding debt, see the section captioned \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in Part II, Item 7 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nAs a result of our indebtedness:\n\u2022\nOur ability to invest in growing our business is constrained by the financial covenants contained in our credit facility, which require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and liquidity levels;\n\u2022\nWe must dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations and other capital resources to debt service, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development and other cash requirements;\n\u2022\nOur flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in the markets in which we compete may be limited, including our ability to engage in mergers and acquisitions activity, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022\nWe are subject to mandatory field audits and control of cash receipts by the lenders if we do not maintain liquidity above certain thresholds;\n\u2022\nWe may be more vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to make payments on other indebtedness or obligations.\nOur credit facility contains restrictive covenants that require us to comply with and maintain certain liquidity levels and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, as well as restrict our ability, subject to certain thresholds, to:\n\u2022\nIncur debt;\n\u2022\nIncur liens;\n\u2022\nMake acquisitions of businesses or entities or sell certain assets;\n\u2022\nMake investments, including loans, guarantees and advances;\n\u2022\nEngage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nPay dividends or engage in stock repurchases; and\n\u2022\nEnter into certain restrictive agreements.\nThe weakness we experienced for several years in the market for our storage, back up and data protection business, which is the primary driver of our overall cash flow and operating income, placed increased pressure on our ability to meet our liquidity and fixed charge coverage ratio covenants. In recent periods, our business has declined due, in part, to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we fell out of compliance with certain financial covenants, including, for example, the total net leverage ratio and total leverage ratio covenants for the fourth fiscal quarter period ending March 31, 2020. We received a waiver from our lenders for the noncompliance of these covenants. In June 2020, we amended our debt agreements to revise our financial covenants in light of currently expected business levels under current market conditions, including the negative impact of COVID-19. These amendments required us to make significant payments to our lenders, including approximately $1.0 million and to issue 3,400,000 warrants that are exercisable for shares of our common stock, which when exercised will result in significant dilution to our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline. In addition, we also incurred significant costs related to advisors, attorneys and accountants. We believe we will be able to meet these covenants in the future, but if our financial results turn out to be lower than expected, we may breach a covenant, which could result in a default under our credit facility agreements.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness, or to make cash payments in connection with our credit facility, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Further, as our indebtedness reaches maturity, we will be required to make large cash payments or adopt one or more alternatives, such as restructuring indebtedness or obtaining additional debt or equity financing on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may be unable to incur additional debt or refinance our existing debt on acceptable terms, if at all.\nOur credit facility is collateralized by a pledge of all our assets. If we were to default and were unable to obtain a waiver for such a default, the lenders would have a right to foreclose on our assets to satisfy our obligations under\nthese agreements. Any such action on the part of the lenders against us could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn connection with entering into our credit facilities and certain amendments to our prior credit facilities, we were required to issue warrants to purchase our common stock to our lenders. When exercised, these warrants will result in significant dilution to our stockholders. As a result, the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of our outstanding warrants may cause our stock price to decline.\nWe have previously identified deficiencies in our control environment and financial reporting process that resulted in material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and previously concluded that our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2019. As of March 31, 2020, we remediated these material weaknesses and have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. However, if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, material misstatements in our financial statements could occur and impair our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements and could adversely affect investor confidence in our financial reports, which could negatively affect our business.\nWe have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2020. However, in our prior fiscal year and as of March 31, 2019, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the existence of material weaknesses in our control environment, financial reporting process and internal control over financial reporting. We restated our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures for the year ended March 31, 2017, and restated each of the quarterly periods related to the three months ended June 30, 2017 and the three- and six-month periods ended September 30, 2017, following the identification of misstatements as a result of an internal investigation that we concluded in fiscal 2020. This prior restatement and our ineffective internal control over financial reporting damaged our reputation, caused us to incur a significant amount of costs and resulted in the distraction of our management team from the operation of our business. We cannot provide assurance that the material weaknesses and deficiencies that we identified as of March 31, 2019 will not reoccur, or that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not arise or be identified in the future. We intend to continue to monitor the tone at the top of our organization, our financial reporting process, and our operational, information technology, financial systems, compliance and infrastructure procedures and controls. We also intend to continue to expand, train, retain and manage our personnel who are essential to effective internal control and compliance. In doing so, we will continue to incur expenses and expend management time.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results in the future. Moreover, because of the inherent limitations of any control system, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, or at all. If we are unable to provide reliable and timely financial reports in the future, our business and reputation may be further harmed. Restated financial statements and failures in internal control may also cause us to fail to meet reporting obligations or debt covenants, negatively affect investor confidence in our management and the accuracy of our financial statements and disclosures, or result in adverse publicity and concerns from investors, any of which could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock, subject us to further regulatory investigations and penalties or stockholder litigation, and materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Business Operations\nWe derive significant revenue from products incorporating tape technology. Our future results of operations depend in part on continued market acceptance and use of products incorporating tape technology; in the past, decreases in the market have materially and adversely impacted our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we are unable to compete with the introduction of new storage technologies by other companies, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe currently derive significant revenue from products that incorporate some form of tape technology, and we expect to continue to derive significant revenue from these products in the next several years. As a result, our future results of operations depend in part on continued market acceptance and use of products employing tape technology. We believe that the storage environment is changing, including reduced demand for tape products.\nDecreased market acceptance or use of products employing tape technology has materially and adversely impacted our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we expect that our revenues from certain types of tape products could continue to decline, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nDisk and solid-state products, as well as various software solutions and alternative technologies such as crystal and organic material-based storage have been announced by other companies. We expect that, over time, many of our tape customers could migrate toward our other products and solutions and that revenue from these other products and solutions will generate a greater proportion of our revenue in the future. While we are making targeted investments in software, disk backup systems and other alternative technologies, these markets are characterized by rapid innovation, evolving customer demands and strong competition, including competition with several companies who are also significant customers. If we are not successful in our efforts, we may not be able to retain customers or attract new customers, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not be entitled to forgiveness of our recently received Paycheck Protection Program loan, and our application for the Paycheck Protection Program loan could in the future be determined to have been impermissible, which could result in the imposition on us of fines and other penalties, or could result in damage to our reputation.\nOn April 13, 2020 we entered into a Paycheck Protection Term Note for a principal amount of $10,000,000, or the PPP Loan, under the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, of the recently enacted Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act. We have used all of the proceeds from the PPP Loan to maintain our employees and their current salaries in the United States. The PPP Loan has a two-year term and bears annual interest at a rate of 1.0%. Payments of principal and interest on the PPP Loan will be deferred for no longer than ten months from loan origination. Thereafter, we are required to pay the lender equal monthly payments of principal and interest.\nThe CARES Act and the PPP provide a mechanism for forgiveness of up to the full amount borrowed. Under the PPP, we may apply for and be granted forgiveness for all or part of the PPP Loan. The amount of loan proceeds eligible for forgiveness is based on a formula that takes into account a number of factors, including the amount of loan proceeds used by us during a specified period after receipt of the loan proceeds for certain purposes, including payroll costs, interest on certain mortgage obligations, rent payments on certain leases, and certain qualified utility payments, provided that at least 60% of the loan amount is used for eligible payroll costs. Subject to the other requirements and limitations on loan forgiveness, only loan proceeds spent on payroll and other eligible costs during the covered period will qualify for forgiveness. We will be required to repay any portion of the outstanding principal that is not forgiven, along with accrued interest, in accordance with the amortization schedule described above, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be eligible for loan forgiveness, that we will ultimately apply for forgiveness, or that any amount of the PPP Loan will ultimately be forgiven by the U.S. Small Business Administration, or the SBA.\nIn order to apply for the PPP Loan, we were required to certify, among other things, that the current economic uncertainty made the PPP Loan request necessary to support our ongoing operations. We made this certification in good faith after analyzing, among other things, our financial situation and access to alternative forms of capital, and believe that we satisfied all eligibility criteria for the PPP Loan, and that our receipt of the PPP Loan is consistent with the spirit and broad objectives of the PPP and of the CARES Act. The certification described above does not contain any objective criteria and is subject to interpretation. On April 23, 2020, the SBA issued guidance stating that it is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be able to make the required certification in good faith. In addition, the SBA stated its intent to audit the PPP Loan application of any company, like us, that received proceeds under the PPP of more than $2 million. Additionally, on May 8, 2020, we were one of five publicly traded companies to receive a letter from the United States House of Representatives\u2019 Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, or the Subcommittee, requesting that we return the PPP Loan proceeds, and if we did not return the proceeds, requiring us to produce to the Subcommittee specified documentation related to our PPP Loan. We intend to cooperate fully with the Subcommittee\u2019s review of our PPP Loan. There has also been significant media coverage and controversy with respect to public companies applying for and receiving PPP loans. If we are later determined to have violated any of the laws or governmental regulations that apply to us in connection with the PPP Loan, such as the False Claims Act, or it is otherwise determined that we were ineligible to receive the PPP Loan, we may be subject to penalties, including significant\ncivil, criminal and administrative penalties and could be required to repay the PPP Loan in its entirety. In addition, receipt of a PPP Loan may result in adverse publicity and damage to our reputation. The Subcommittee\u2019s review of our PPP Loan is requiring us to consume a significant amount of financial and management resources. In addition, any review or audit by the SBA or other government entity or claims under the False Claims Act, could consume additional significant financial and management resources. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on indirect sales channels to market and sell our branded products. Therefore, the loss of or deterioration in our relationship with one or more of our resellers or distributors, or our inability to establish new indirect sales channels to drive growth of our branded revenue, especially for disk backup systems and scale-out tiered storage, could negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe sell most of our branded products to distributors such as Arrow Electronics, Inc. and other VARs and DMRs such as CDW Corporation, who in turn sell our products to end users. We use different distributors, VARs and DMRs in different countries and regions in the world. The success of these sales channels is hard to predict, particularly over time, and we have no purchase commitments or long-term orders from them that assure us of any baseline sales through these channels. Several of our resellers carry competing product lines that they may promote over our products. A reseller might not continue to purchase our products or market them effectively, and each reseller determines the type and amount of our products that it will purchase from us and the pricing of the products that it sells to end user customers. Establishing new indirect sales channels is an important part of our strategy to drive growth of our branded revenue and as our business shifts toward our branded products, these indirect sales channels will have increasing importance to our business.\nWhen we introduce new products and solutions, as we did in the last half of our fiscal year 2019, our relationship with channel partners that historically have sold other products and solutions and that now compete with our new offerings could be adversely impacted. For example, we introduced our new F-Series all-flash array and R-Series ruggedized products in fiscal year 2019, causing us in some cases to more directly compete for primary storage sales with channel partners that sell other primary storage products.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by any number of factors related to our channel partners, including:\n\u2022\nA change in competitive strategy that adversely affects a reseller\u2019s willingness or ability to distribute our products;\n\u2022\nThe reduction, delay or cancellation of orders or the return of a significant amount of products;\n\u2022\nOur inability to gain traction in developing new indirect sales channels for our branded products;\n\u2022\nThe loss of one or more of such distributors or resellers;\n\u2022\nAny financial difficulties of such distributors or resellers that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us; or\n\u2022\nChanges in requirements or programs that allow our products to be sold by third parties to government customers.\nIf our products fail to meet our or our customers\u2019 specifications for quality and reliability, we may face liability and reputational or financial harm which may adversely impact our results of operations and our competitive position may suffer.\nAlthough we place great emphasis on product quality, we may from time to time experience problems with the performance of our products, which could result in one or more of the following:\n\u2022\nIncreased costs related to fulfillment of our warranty obligations;\n\u2022\nThe reduction, delay or cancellation of orders or the return of a significant amount of products;\n\u2022\nFocused failure analysis causing distraction of the sales, operations and management teams; or\n\u2022\nThe loss of reputation in the market and customer goodwill.\nThese factors could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, we face potential liability for performance problems of our products because our end users employ our storage technologies for the storage and backup of important data and to satisfy regulatory requirements. Loss of\nthis data could cost our customers significant amounts of money, directly and indirectly as a result of lost revenues, intellectual property, proprietary business information or other harm to their business. In some cases, the failure of our products may have been caused by third-party technology that we incorporate into our products. Even if failures are caused by third-party technology, we may be required to expend resources to address the failure and work with our customers to preserve our relationship with them. We could also potentially face claims for product liability from our customers if our products cause property damage or bodily injury. Although there are limitations of liability in our commercial agreements and we maintain technology errors and omissions liability and general liability insurance, our insurance may not cover potential claims of these types or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. Any imposition of liability or litigation costs that are not covered by insurance or is in excess of our limitation of liability or our insurance coverage could harm our business.\nA certain percentage of our sales are to a few customers, some of which are also competitors, and these customers generally have no minimum or long-term purchase commitments. The loss of, or a significant reduction in demand from, one or more key customers could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur product sales have been and continue to be concentrated among a small number of our direct end-user customers and channel partners as a result of how we sell our products. Under our business model, we sell directly to end user customers, through distributors, VARs and DMRs (which we collectively call our \u201cchannel partners\u201d), as well as to OEMs. We sell to many end-user customers and channel partners on purchase orders, not under the terms of a binding long-term procurement agreement. Accordingly, they generally are not obligated to purchase any minimum product volume, and our relationships with them are terminable at will. In addition, recently we have focused our direct-sales business on the largest users of hierarchical storage architectures, the so-called \u201cHyper-scalers\u201d; there are very few of these extremely large storage customers. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019 no customers represented 10% or more of the Company\u2019s total revenue. A significant reduction in orders from, or a loss of, one or more large customers would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSome of our tape and disk products are incorporated into larger storage systems or solutions that are marketed and sold to end users by large OEM customers as well as channel partners. Because of this, we have limited market access to the end users who purchase from the OEMs and channel partners, which limits our ability to influence the end users\u2019 purchasing decisions and to forecast their future purchases of our products. Revenue from OEM customers has decreased in recent years. Certain of our large OEM customers are also our competitors, and such customers could decide to reduce or terminate their purchases of our products for competitive reasons. These market conditions increase our reliance on these OEM and channel partners. Thus, a significant reduction, delay or cancellation of their orders with us would materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nA portion of our sales are to various agencies and departments of the U.S. federal government, and funding cuts to federal spending can adversely impact our revenue. In the past, we have experienced the impact of reduced government spending and temporary government shutdowns on our sales to government agencies. Future spending cuts by the U.S. federal government, temporary shutdowns of the U.S. federal government or changes in its procurement processes or criteria could decrease our sales to the federal government and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur results of operations depend on continuing and increasing market acceptance of our existing limited number of products and on new product introductions, which may not be successful, in which case our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nA limited number of products comprise a significant majority of our sales, and due to rapid technological change in the industry, our future results of operations depend on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products. To compete effectively, we must continually improve existing products and introduce new ones. We have devoted and expect to continue to devote considerable management and financial resources to these efforts. Since July 2018, we have introduced several new products that are designed to solve a variety of our customers\u2019 pressing needs. Those products include:\n\u2022\nF-Series: an all-flash NVMe storage array - designed for the most demanding media workloads\n\u2022\nR-Series: a ruggedized in-vehicle storage array purpose-built for autonomous vehicle development (to ingest large number of data streams) or for transportation surveillance applications;\n\u2022\nVS-Series: a highly resilient, hyper-converged surveillance storage system that meets all the needs of security teams; and\n\u2022\nDistributed Cloud Services: a set of Quantum services that offers cloud-like simplicity and economics for on-premise environments.\nWe have seen market interest in each of these new product lines; however, we cannot provide assurance that:\n\u2022\nOur new products will achieve market acceptance and significant market share, or that the markets for these products will continue or grow as we have anticipated;\n\u2022\nOur new products will be successfully or timely qualified with our customers by meeting customer performance and quality specifications which must occur before customers will place large product orders; or\n\u2022\nWe will achieve high volume production of these new products in a timely manner, if at all;\n\u2022\nWe will introduce additional new products in the time frame we are forecasting; or\n\u2022\nWe will not experience technical, quality, performance-related or other difficulties that could prevent or delay the introduction and market acceptance of new products.\nIf we are not successful in timely completion of our new product qualifications and then ramping sales to our key customers, our revenue and results of operations could be adversely impacted. In addition, if the quality of our products is not acceptable to our customers, this could result in customer dissatisfaction, lost revenue and increased warranty and repair costs.\nWe continue to face risks related to economic uncertainty and slow economic growth.\nUncertainty about economic conditions, particularly under the current circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, poses a risk as businesses may further reduce or postpone spending in response to reduced budgets, tightening of credit markets, negative financial news and declines in income or asset values which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The volatile economic conditions in recent years along with periods of economic uncertainty in various countries around the world has made planning more difficult for us. We continue to face risks related to uncertain tariff levels between countries where our products are manufactured and where they are sold, unstable political and economic conditions in Europe, including concerns about sovereign debt, and uncertainty related to the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union and related political matters, which could negatively impact the U.S. and global economies and adversely affect our financial results. In addition, we may not be able to access capital markets in the near-term or our ability to access capital markets may be restricted. We will not be eligible to use a common short-form registration statement on Form S-3, which would better enable us to access capital markets, until November 2020. Our inability to access capital markets in an effective and efficient manner could have an impact on our ability to react to changing economic and business conditions and could also materially and adversely affect our ability to sustain our operations at their current levels.\nCompetition is intensifying in the data storage and protection market as a result of competitors introducing products based on new technology standards and merger and acquisition activity, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur competitors in the data storage and protection market are aggressively trying to advance and develop new technologies and products to compete against our technologies and products; consequently, we face the risk that customers could choose competitor products over ours. Competition in our markets is characterized by technological innovation and advancement. As a result of competition and new technology standards, our sales or gross margins could decline, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Some of those competitors, such as IBM, HPE, Seagate Technology and others, are much larger and have more diverse product offerings, and aggressively compete based on their reputations and greater size.\nTechnological developments and competition over the years in the tape automation market, and in the storage market in general, have resulted in decreased prices for tape automation products and our other product offerings. Pricing pressure is more pronounced in the tape automation market for entry-level products and less pronounced for enterprise products. Over time, the prices of our products and competitor products have decreased, but such products often incorporate new and/or different features and technologies from what we offered in prior years. We face risks that customers could choose competitors\u2019 products over ours due to these features and technologies or\ndue to pricing differences. We address pricing pressure in three ways: first, by reducing production costs; second, by adding features to increase value to maintain a certain level of gross margin for our tape automation systems; and third, by selling the overall value of our technologies in solving the customer\u2019s business challenges thereby changing the conversation from a pricing negotiation to a value discussion. However, short term cost reduction efforts, and the value discussions may not yield new sales. In addition, if competition further intensifies, or if there is additional industry consolidation, our sales and gross margins for tape automation systems could decline, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIndustry consolidation and competing technologies with device products, which include tape drives and removable hard drives, have resulted in decreased prices and increasingly commoditized device products. Additionally, the competitive landscape in the data storage and protection market could continue to change due to merger and acquisition activity. Such transactions may impact us in a number of ways. For instance, they could result in:\n\u2022\ncompetitors consolidating, having greater resources and becoming more competitive with us;\n\u2022\ncompanies that we have not historically competed against entering into one or more of our primary markets and increasing competition in such market(s);\n\u2022\ncustomers that are also competitors becoming more competitive with us and/or reducing their purchase of our products; and\n\u2022\ncompetitors acquiring our current suppliers or business partners and negatively impacting our business model.\nThese transactions also create uncertainty and disruption in the market because the timing of such a transaction and its degree of impact, or whether it will happen at all, are often unknown. Given these factors and others, such merger and acquisition activity may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant decline in our media royalty or branded software revenues could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur media royalties and branded software revenues generate relatively greater profit margins than some of our other products, and can significantly impact our overall profitability. We receive media royalty revenue based on tape media cartridges sold by various tape media manufacturers and resellers. Under our patent and technology license agreements with these companies, each of the licensees determines the pricing and number of units of tape media cartridges that it sells. Our media royalty revenue varies depending on the level of sales of the various media cartridge offerings sold by the licensees and other factors, including:\n\u2022\nThe continued use by our customers of tape media for storage;\n\u2022\nThe size of the installed base of devices and similar products that use tape media cartridges;\n\u2022\nThe performance of our strategic licensing partners, which sell tape media cartridges;\n\u2022\nThe relative growth in units of newer device products, since the associated media cartridges for newer products typically sell at higher prices than the media cartridges associated with older products;\n\u2022\nThe media consumption habits and rates of end users;\n\u2022\nThe pattern of device retirements;\n\u2022\nThe level of channel inventories; and\n\u2022\nagreement on standards for newer generations of the tape media that generates our royalty revenue.\nSome of our products contain licensed, third-party technology that provides important product functionality and features. The loss or inability to obtain any such license could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCertain of our products contain technology licensed from third parties that provides important product functionality and features. We may not have continued access to this technology, for instance, if the licensing company ceased to exist, either from bankruptcy, dissolution or purchase by a competitor. In some cases, we may seek to enforce our contractual protections via litigation against the licensing company itself, which may cause us to incur significant legal or other costs and may not be resolved in our favor. Other legal actions, such as intellectual property actions, brought against the licensing company could also impact our future access to the technology. We also have limited visibility or control of the technology roadmap at the licensing company and cannot ensure that the licensing company will advance the roadmap of the licensed technology in the manner best for us. Any of these actions could negatively impact our technology licensing, thereby reducing the functionality or features of our products, and could\nmaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also face the risk of not being able to quickly implement a replacement technology or otherwise mitigate the risks associated with not having access to this licensed technology, which may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have taken considerable steps towards reducing our cost structure. The steps we have taken may not reduce our cost structure to a level appropriate in relation to our future sales and therefore, these cost reductions may be insufficient to achieve profitability.\nIn the last several years, we have recorded significant restructuring charges and made cash payments to reduce our cost of sales and operating expenses to respond to adverse economic and industry conditions, to execute strategic management decisions and to rationalize our operations following acquisitions. During fiscal years 2018 through 2020 we have implemented restructuring plans to eliminate certain positions in the U.S. and internationally and to exit certain locations. These restructuring plans may result in decreases to our revenues or adversely affect our ability to grow our business in the future. Workforce reductions may also adversely affect employee morale and our ability to retain our employees. We may take future steps to further reduce our operating costs, including future cost reduction steps or restructurings in response to strategic decisions, adverse changes in our business or industry or future acquisitions. We may be unable to reduce our cost of sales and operating expenses at a rate and to a level appropriate in relation to our future sales, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these restructuring plans within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we experience delays, or if other unforeseen events occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nSince May 2018, we have hired almost an entirely new executive team, including a new CEO and new CFO. In addition, prior year restructurings and the events that led to our restatement have resulted in a significant loss of employees. If we are unable to integrate our new executives, as well as retain skilled executives and other employees, our business could be materially and adversely impacted.\nIn May of 2018, we hired a new CFO, and in July 2018, we hired a new CEO. Since that time, we have hired several other new senior executives in many areas of our business, including sales, supply chain management, finance and legal. These changes were due in part to the events that caused us to restate our financial statements for the past several years. In addition, in fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018, we laid off employees in order to reduce costs in response to declining sales. All of these factors have increased the possibility that employees may decide to leave our company to pursue their careers elsewhere.\nWe may not be able to integrate all of our new executives successfully. Further, we may be subject to continued turnover in our employee base or the inability to fill open headcount requisitions due to competition, concerns about our operational performance, business culture or other factors. In addition, we may need to rely on the performance of employees whose skill sets are not sufficiently developed to fulfill their expected job responsibilities. Any of these situations could disrupt our business, prevent us from implementing the policy and process changes advocated by new management, and otherwise impair or delay our ability to realize operational and strategic objectives and cause increased expenses and lost sales opportunities.\nThe loss of the services of any of our key employees, the inability to attract or retain qualified talent in the future, or delays in hiring required talent, particularly sales and engineering talent, could delay the development and introduction of our products or services and/or negatively affect our ability to sell our products or services.\nIf we do not successfully manage the changes that we have made and may continue to make to our infrastructure and management, our business could be disrupted, and that could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nManaging change is an important focus for us. In recent years, we have implemented several significant initiatives involving our sales and marketing, product engineering and operations organizations, aimed at increasing our efficiency and better aligning these groups with our corporate strategy. In addition, we have reduced headcount to streamline and consolidate our supporting functions as appropriate in response to market or competitive conditions\nand following past acquisitions and have increased our reliance on certain third-party business relationships. If we are unable to successfully manage the changes that we implement and detect and address issues as they arise, our business could be disrupted, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted.\nThird-party intellectual property infringement claims could result in substantial liability and significant costs, and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nFrom time to time, third parties allege that our products infringe their patented or proprietary technology and demand that we purchase a license from them. For example, we are currently in patent litigation with Realtime Data LLC d/b/a IXO, which has been stayed, described in Note 10: Commitments and Contingencies. The ultimate outcome of any license discussion or litigation, including the Realtime litigation, is uncertain. Adverse resolution of any third-party infringement claim could subject us to substantial liabilities and require us to refrain from manufacturing and selling certain products. In addition, the costs incurred in intellectual property litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property or if others use our proprietary technology without authorization, our competitive position may suffer.\nOur future success and ability to compete depends in part on our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secrets laws and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect our proprietary technology. However, we cannot provide assurance that patents will be issued with respect to pending or future patent applications that we have filed or plan to file or that our patents will be upheld as valid or will prevent the development of competitive products or that any actions we have taken will adequately protect our intellectual property rights. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, customers, potential customers, contract manufacturers and others as required, in which we strictly limit access to, and distribution of, our software and further limit the disclosure and use of our proprietary information.\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain or use our products or technology. Enforcing our intellectual property rights can sometimes only be accomplished through the use of litigation. Our competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.\nWe license certain of our software under \u201copen source\u201d licenses. Because of the characteristics of open source software licenses, it may be relatively easy for competitors, some of whom have greater resources than we have, to enter our markets and compete with us.\nOne of the characteristics of open source software is that the source code for our open source projects is publicly available, and anyone who obtains copies has a license under certain of our intellectual property rights, which, depending on the license, may include certain of our patents, to modify and redistribute the software and use it to compete in the marketplace. Such competition can develop without the degree of overhead and lead time required by traditional proprietary software companies. It is possible for competitors to use our open source project software to develop their own software, potentially reducing the demand for our solution and putting price pressure on our subscription offerings. We cannot guarantee that competitive pressure or the availability of new open source software will not result in price reductions, reduced operating margins and loss of market share, any one of which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, we use our own open source project software in our proprietary products. As a result, there is a risk that we may inadvertently release as open source certain code that was intended to be kept as proprietary, that reveals confidential information regarding the inner workings of our proprietary products, or that could enable competitors to more readily reverse engineer or replicate aspects of our proprietary technology that we would otherwise protect as trade secrets. We may also accept contributions from third parties to our open source projects, and it may be difficult for us to accurately determine the origin of the contributions and whether their use, including in our proprietary products, infringes, misappropriates or violates third-party intellectual property or other rights. The availability of certain of our own software in source code form may also enable others to detect and exploit security vulnerabilities in our products.\nOur products may contain \"open source\" software and failure to comply with the terms of the open source license could have a material adverse effect on our competitive positions and financial results.\nCertain products or technologies acquired or developed by us may include \u201copen source\u201d software. Open source software is typically licensed for use at no initial charge. Certain open source software licenses, however, require users of the open source software to license to others any software that is based on, incorporates or interacts with, the open source software under the terms of the open source license. Although we endeavor to comply fully with such requirements, third parties could claim that we are required to license larger portions of our software than we believe we are required to license under open source software licenses. If such claims were successful, they could adversely impact our competitive position and financial results by providing our competitors with access to sensitive information that may help them develop competitive products. In addition, our use of open source software may harm our business and subject us to intellectual property claims, litigation or proceedings in the future because:\n\u2022\nopen source license terms may be ambiguous and may subject us to unanticipated obligations regarding our products, technologies and intellectual property;\n\u2022\nopen source software generally cannot be protected under trade secret law; and\n\u2022\nit may be difficult for us to accurately determine the origin of the open source code and whether the open source software infringes, misappropriates or violates third-party intellectual property or other rights.\nAs a result of our global manufacturing and sales operations, we are subject to a variety of risks related to our business outside of the U.S., any of which could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA significant portion of our manufacturing and sales operations and supply chain occurs in countries other than the U.S. We also have sales outside the U.S. We utilize contract manufacturers to produce and fulfill orders for our products and have suppliers for various components, several of which have operations located in foreign countries including China, Hungary, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Mexico, the Philippines and Thailand. Because of these operations, we are subject to a number of risks including:\n\u2022\nimport and export duties and value-added taxes;\n\u2022\nimport, export and trade regulation changes that could erode our profit margins or restrict our ability to transport our products;\n\u2022\nreduced or limited protection of our intellectual property;\n\u2022\ncompliance with multiple and potentially conflicting regulatory requirements and practices;\n\u2022\ncommercial laws that favor local businesses;\n\u2022\nexposure to economic fluctuations including inflationary risk and continuing sovereign debt risk;\n\u2022\nshortages in component parts and raw materials;\n\u2022\nthe burden and cost of complying with foreign and U.S. laws governing corporate conduct outside the U.S. including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act and other similar regulations;\n\u2022\nadverse movement of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar (the currency in which our results are reported) and uncertain global economic conditions generally;\n\u2022\ninflexible employee contracts and employment laws that may make it difficult to terminate or change the compensation structure for employees in some foreign countries in the event of business downturns;\n\u2022\nrecruiting employees in highly competitive markets and wage inflation in certain markets;\n\u2022\npotential restrictions on the transfer of funds between countries;\n\u2022\npolitical instability, military, social and infrastructure risks, especially in emerging or developing economies;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, including earthquakes, flooding, typhoons and tsunamis;\n\u2022\npandemics and epidemics, including the impact of COVID-19, and governmental restrictions on the operation of businesses, travel and other restrictions, which may vary from country-to-country; and\n\u2022\ncultural differences that affect the way we do business.\nAny or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur quarterly results of operations have fluctuated significantly, and past quarterly results of operations should not be used to predict future performance.\nOur quarterly results of operations have fluctuated significantly in the past and could fluctuate significantly in the future. As a result, our quarterly results of operations should not be used to predict future performance. Quarterly results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in IT spending as a result of economic conditions or fluctuations in U.S. federal government spending;\n\u2022\nfailure by our contract manufacturers to complete shipments in the last month of a quarter during which a substantial portion of our products are typically shipped;\n\u2022\nchanges in product mix;\n\u2022\nnew product announcements by us or our competitors which may cause delays in purchasing;\n\u2022\ncustomers canceling, reducing, deferring or rescheduling significant orders as a result of excess inventory levels, weak economic conditions or other factors;\n\u2022\nseasonality, including customer fiscal year-ends and budget availability impacting customer demand for our products;\n\u2022\ndeclines in large orders (defined as orders greater than $200,000);\n\u2022\ndeclines in royalty or software revenues;\n\u2022\nproduct development and ramp cycles and product performance or quality issues of ours or our competitors;\n\u2022\npoor execution of and performance against expected sales and marketing plans and strategies;\n\u2022\nreduced demand from our OEM or distributors, VAR, DMR and other large customers;\n\u2022\nincreased competition which may, among other things, increase pricing pressure or reduce sales;\n\u2022\nrestructuring actions or unexpected costs; and\n\u2022\nforeign exchange fluctuations.\nOur manufacturing, component production and service repair are outsourced to third-party contract manufacturers, component suppliers and service providers. If we cannot obtain products, parts and services from these third parties in a cost effective and timely manner that meets our customers\u2019 expectations, this could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany aspects of our supply chain and operational results are dependent on the performance of third-party business partners. We use third-party contract manufacturers, service providers and/or product integrators in connection with our outsourced manufacturing model. We face a number of risks as a result of these relationships, including, among others:\nSole source of product supply\nIn many cases, our business partner may be the sole source of supply for the products or parts they manufacture, or the services they provide, for us. Because we are relying on one supplier, we are at greater risk of experiencing shortages, reduced production capacity or other delays in customer deliveries that could result in customer dissatisfaction, lost sales and increased expenses, each of which could materially damage customer relationships and result in lost revenue.\nCost and purchase commitments\nWe may not be able to control the costs for the products our business partners manufacture for us or the services they provide to us. They procure inventory to build our products based upon a forecast of customer demand that we provide. We could be responsible for the financial impact on the contract manufacturer, supplier or service provider of any reduction or product mix shift in the forecast relative to materials that they had already purchased under a prior forecast. Such a variance in forecasted demand could require us to pay them for finished goods in excess of current customer demand or for excess or obsolete inventory and generally incur higher costs. As a result, we could experience reduced gross margins and operating losses based on these purchase commitments. With respect to service providers, although we have contracts for most of our third-party repair service vendors, the contract period may not be the same as the underlying service contract with our customer. In such cases, we face risks that the third-party service provider may increase the cost of providing services over subsequent periods contracted with our customer.\nFinancial condition and stability\nOur third-party business partners may suffer adverse financial or operational results or may be negatively impacted by global and local economic conditions. Therefore, we may face interruptions in the supply of product components or service as a result of financial or other volatility affecting our supply chain. We could suffer production downtime or increased costs to procure alternate products or services as a result of the possible inadequate financial condition of one or more of our business partners.\nQuality and supplier conduct\nWe have limited control over the quality of products and components produced and services provided by our supply chain and third-party contract manufacturing and service business partners. Therefore, the quality of the products, parts or services may not be acceptable to our customers and could result in customer dissatisfaction, lost revenue and increased warranty costs. In addition, we have limited control over the manner in which our business partners conduct their business. Sub-tier suppliers selected by the primary third-party could have process control issues or could select components with latent defects that manifest over a longer period of time. We may face negative consequences or publicity as a result of a third-party\u2019s failure to comply with applicable compliance, trade, environmental or employment regulations.\nAny or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBecause we may order components from suppliers in advance of receipt of customer orders for our products that include these components, we could face a material inventory risk if we fail to accurately forecast demand for our products or manage production, which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nAlthough we use third parties to manufacture our products, in some cases we may retain the responsibility to purchase component inventory to support third-party manufacturing activities, which presents a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition. For instance, as part of our component planning, we may place orders with or pay certain suppliers for components in advance of receipt of customer orders. We may occasionally enter into negotiated orders with vendors early in the manufacturing process of our products to ensure that we have sufficient components for our products to meet anticipated customer demand. Because the design and manufacturing process for these components can be complicated, it is possible that we could experience a design or manufacturing flaw that could delay or even prevent the production of the components for which we previously committed to pay. We also face the risk of ordering too many components, or conversely, not enough components, since supply orders are generally based on forecasts of customer orders rather than actual customer orders. In addition, in some cases, we may make non-cancelable order commitments to our suppliers for work-in-progress, supplier\u2019s finished goods, custom sub-assemblies, discontinued (end-of-life) components and Quantum-unique raw materials that are necessary to meet our lead times for finished goods. If we cannot change or be released from supply orders, we could incur costs from the purchase of unusable components, either due to a delay in the production of the components or other supplies or as a result of inaccurately predicting supply orders in advance of customer orders. These same risks exist with our third-party contract manufacturing partners. Our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if we incur increased costs or are unable to fulfill customer orders.\nBecause we rely heavily on distributors and other resellers to market and sell our products, if one or more distributors were to experience a significant deterioration in its financial condition or its relationship with us, this could disrupt the distribution of our products and reduce our revenue, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe heavily utilize distributors and VARs to perform the functions necessary to market and sell our products in certain product and geographic segments. To fulfill this role, the distributor must maintain an acceptable level of financial stability, creditworthiness and the ability to successfully manage business relationships with the customers it serves directly. Under our distributor agreements with these companies, each of the distributors determines the type and amount of our products that it will purchase from us and the pricing of the products that it sells to its customers. If the distributor is unable to perform in an acceptable manner, we may be required to reduce the amount of sales of our product to the distributor or terminate the relationship. We may also incur financial losses for product returns from distributors or for the failure or refusal of distributors to pay obligations owed to us. Either scenario could result in fewer of our products being available to the affected market segments, reduced levels of\ncustomer satisfaction and/or increased expenses, which could in turn have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur stock price has experienced significant volatility in the recent past, and this significant volatility may continue to occur and could cause the trading price of our common stock to\ndecline.\nOur stock price has been extremely volatile in the recent past. For example, the closing price of our common stock was $8.35 on January 29, 2020 and was $1.48 on March 18, 2020.\nThe trading price of our common stock may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our results of operations;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet our expectations or the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nfailure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or any investigations or enforcement actions; related to a potential failure to comply with applicable regulations;\n\u2022\nsignificant changes in our brand or reputation;\n\u2022\nnew products, services, innovations and strategic developments by our competitors or us, or business combinations and investments by our competitors or us;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public, and the issuance of common stock upon exercise of our outstanding warrants;\n\u2022\nlarge or sudden purchases or sales of stock by existing or new investors; and\n\u2022\nthe result of any litigation or governmental investigation, which could result in liabilities and reputational harm.\nOther macro-economic forces also could affect our stock price, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in interest and exchange rates;\n\u2022\na continued widespread decline in the U.S. or global economy as a result of the continued impact of COVID-19 or other pandemics or natural disasters;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for technology companies in particular; and\n\u2022\ntariffs imposed by the U.S. Government on sales originating in or being shipped to countries with which we have on-going trade or other political conflicts.\nAny of these events and factors may cause our stock price to rise or fall and may adversely affect our business and financing opportunities.\nOur operation and design processes are subject to safety and environmental regulations which could lead to increased costs, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to, among other things, the use, storage, discharge and disposal of materials and substances used in our facilities as well as the safety of our employees and the public. Current regulations in the U.S. and various international jurisdictions restrict the use of certain potentially hazardous materials used in electronic products and components (including lead and some flame retardants), impose a \u201ctake back\u201d obligation on manufacturers for the financing of the collection, recovery and disposal of electrical and electronic equipment and require extensive investigation into and disclosure regarding certain minerals used in our supply chain. We have implemented procedures and will likely continue to introduce new processes to comply with current and future safety and environmental legislation. However, measures taken now or in the future to comply with such legislation may adversely affect our costs or product sales by requiring us to acquire costly equipment or materials, redesign processes or to incur other significant expenses in adapting our supply chain, waste disposal and emission management processes. Furthermore, safety or environmental claims or our failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us or the suspension of affected operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to many laws and regulations, and violation of or changes in those requirements could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. and international laws and requirements regarding corporate conduct, fair competition, corruption prevention and import and export practices, including laws applicable to U.S. government contractors. In addition, the SEC has adopted disclosure rules related to the supply of certain minerals originating from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries, and we have incurred costs to comply with such regulations and may realize other costs relating to the sourcing and availability of minerals used in our products. While we maintain a rigorous corporate ethics and compliance program, we may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny, significant monetary fines or penalties, suspension of business opportunities or loss of jurisdictional operating rights as a result of any failure to comply with those requirements. If we were to be subject to a compliance investigation, we may incur increased personnel and legal costs. In addition, if we identify that we have fallen out of compliance, we may proactively take corrective actions, including the filing of voluntary self-disclosure statements with applicable agencies, which could cause us to incur additional expenses and subject us to penalties and other consequences that could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Our supply and distribution models may be reliant upon the actions of our third-party business partners and we may also be exposed to potential liability resulting from their violation of these or other compliance requirements. Further, our U.S. and international business models are based on currently applicable regulatory requirements and exceptions. Changes in those requirements or exceptions could necessitate changes to our business model. Any of these consequences could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nA cybersecurity breach into our products when used by our customers could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business, harm our reputation, expose us to significant liability or otherwise damage our financial results.\nA cybersecurity breach into a system we have sold to a customer could negatively affect our reputation as a trusted provider of large-scale storage, archive and data protection products by adversely affecting the market\u2019s perception of the security or reliability of our products and services. Many of our customers and partners store sensitive data on our products, and a cybersecurity breach related to our products could harm our reputation and potentially expose us to significant liability.\nWe also maintain sensitive data related to our employees, strategic partners and customers, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information on our own systems. We employ sophisticated security measures; however, we may face threats across our infrastructure including unauthorized access, security breaches and other system disruptions.\nIt is critical to our business that our employees\u2019, strategic partners\u2019 and customers\u2019 sensitive information remains secure and that our customers perceive that this information is secure. A cybersecurity breach could result in unauthorized access to, loss of, or unauthorized disclosure of such information. A cybersecurity breach could expose us to litigation, indemnity obligations, government investigations and other possible liabilities. Additionally, a cyber-attack, whether actual or perceived, could result in negative publicity which could harm our reputation and reduce our customers\u2019 confidence in the effectiveness of our solutions, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. A breach of our security systems could also expose us to increased costs including remediation costs, disruption of operations or increased cybersecurity protection costs that may have a material adverse effect on our business. Although we maintain technology errors and omissions liability insurance, our insurance may not cover potential claims of these types or may not be adequate to indemnify us for inability that may be imposed. Any imposition or liability or litigation costs that are not covered by insurance or in excess of our insurance coverage could harm our business.\nOur actual or perceived failure to adequately protect personal data could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA variety of state, national, foreign, and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personally identifiable information. These privacy- and data protection-related laws and regulations are evolving, with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can delay or impede the development of new products.\nFor example, in 2016, the European Parliament enacted the General Data Protection Regulation (or \u201cGDPR\u201d) which governs the collection, storage and use of personal information gathered in the European Union, regardless of\nwhere such information is stored. In 2018, California enacted the Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which regulates information stored by companies doing business in California. The regulations implementing the CCPA have not yet been published, and the implementation of standards for GDPR compliance continue to evolve. Our products\u2019 and internal systems\u2019 actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or to protect personal data, could result in enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, which could result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, subject us to claims or other remedies and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe must maintain appropriate levels of service parts inventories. If we do not have sufficient service parts inventories, we may experience increased levels of customer dissatisfaction. If we hold excessive service parts inventories, we may incur financial losses.\nWe maintain levels of service parts inventories to satisfy future warranty obligations and also to earn service revenue by providing enhanced and extended warranty and repair service during and beyond the warranty period. We estimate the required amount of service parts inventories based on historical usage and forecasts of future warranty and extended warranty requirements, including estimates of failure rates and costs to repair, and out of warranty revenue. Given the significant levels of judgment inherently involved in the process, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain appropriate levels of service parts inventories to satisfy customer needs and to avoid financial losses from excess service parts inventories. If we are unable to maintain appropriate levels of service parts inventories, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted.\nFrom time to time we have made acquisitions. The failure to successfully integrate future acquisitions could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a part of our business strategy, we have in the past and may make acquisitions in the future, subject to certain debt covenants. For example, in March 2020, we acquired the ActiveScale object storage business from Western Digital Technologies, Inc. We may also make significant investments in complementary companies, products or technologies. If we fail to successfully integrate such acquisitions or significant investments, it could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks that we may face in our efforts to integrate any recent or future acquisitions include, among others:\n\u2022\nfailure to realize anticipated synergies from the acquisition;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assimilating and retaining employees;\n\u2022\npotential incompatibility of business cultures or resistance to change;\n\u2022\ncoordinating geographically separate organizations;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns;\n\u2022\ncoordinating infrastructure operations in a rapid and efficient manner;\n\u2022\nthe potential inability to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful incorporation of acquired technology and rights into our products and services;\n\u2022\nfailure of acquired technology or products to provide anticipated revenue or margin contribution;\n\u2022\ninsufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with the acquisition;\n\u2022\ncosts and delays in implementing or integrating common systems and procedures;\n\u2022\nreduction or loss of customer orders due to the potential for market confusion, hesitation and delay;\n\u2022\nimpairment of existing customer, supplier and strategic relationships of either company;\n\u2022\ninsufficient cash flows from operations to fund the working capital and investment requirements;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we may not receive a favorable return on our investment, the original investment may become impaired, and/or we may incur losses from these investments;\n\u2022\ndissatisfaction or performance problems with the acquired company;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of risks of the acquired company that are difficult to quantify, such as litigation;\n\u2022\nthe cost associated with the acquisition, including restructuring actions, which may require cash payments that, if large enough, could materially and adversely affect our liquidity; and\n\u2022\nassumption of unknown liabilities or other unanticipated adverse events or circumstances.\nAcquisitions present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate any business, products, technologies or personnel that we may acquire in the future, and our failure to do so could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the future outcomes related to the estimates used in recording tax liabilities to various taxing authorities result in higher tax liabilities than estimated, then we would have to record tax charges, which could be material.\nWe have provided amounts and recorded liabilities for probable and estimable tax adjustments required by various taxing authorities in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. If events occur that indicate payments of these amounts will be less than estimated, then reversals of these liabilities would create tax benefits recognized in the periods when we determine the liabilities have reduced. Conversely, if events occur which indicate that payments of these amounts will be greater than estimated, then tax charges and additional liabilities would be recorded. In particular, various foreign jurisdictions could challenge the characterization or transfer pricing of certain intercompany transactions. In the event of an unfavorable outcome of such challenge, there exists the possibility of a material tax charge and adverse impact on the results of operations in the period in which the matter is resolved or an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and estimable.\nCertain changes in stock ownership could result in a limitation on the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryovers that can be utilized each year. Should we undergo such a change in stock ownership, it would severely limit the usage of these carryover tax attributes against future income, resulting in additional tax charges, which could be material.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates relative to our position in such currencies could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not currently use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. We have used in the past, and may use in the future, foreign currency forward contracts and derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. To the extent that we have assets or liabilities denominated in a foreign currency that are inadequately hedged or not hedged at all, we may be subject to foreign currency losses, which could be significant.\nOur international operations can act as a natural hedge when both operating expenses and sales are denominated in local currencies. In these instances, although an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of a foreign currency against the U.S. dollar would result in lower sales when translated to U.S. dollars, operating expenses would also be lower in these circumstances. An increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for U.S. dollars would require more of that particular foreign currency to equal a specified amount of U.S. dollars than before such rate increase. In such cases, and if we were to price our products and services in that particular foreign currency, we would receive fewer U.S. dollars than we would have received prior to such rate increase for the foreign currency. Likewise, if we were to price our products and services in U.S. dollars while competitors priced their products in a local currency, an increase in the relative strength of the U.S. dollar would result in our prices being uncompetitive in those markets. Such fluctuations in currency exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 87043, "SIC": 3572, "TIC": "QMCO"}
