{"cik": "1644378", "company": "RMR GROUP INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-11-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Prospective investors should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face but are risks we believe may be material at this time. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, may also impair our business operations or financial results. If any of the events or circumstances described below occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations and the trading price of our securities could decline. Investors and prospective investors should consider the following risks, the information\ncontained under the heading \u201cWarning Concerning Forward Looking Statements\u201d and the risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before deciding whether to invest in our securities. We may update these risk factors in our future periodic reports.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nSubstantially all of our revenues are derived from our provision of management services to a limited number of companies. The loss or failure, or decline in business or assets, of any of the Managed Equity REITs could substantially reduce our revenues.\nThe fees we earn from providing management services to the Managed Equity REITs comprise substantially all our revenues. Our revenues depend in large part on the ability of the Managed Equity REITs to raise capital to invest in real estate assets and on the positive performance of their investments and shareholder returns. Our Managed Equity REITs are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Therefore, our operating results and our ability to maintain and grow our revenues depends upon the ability of our Managed Equity REITs and their significant tenants and operators, some of which are our Managed Operators, to maintain and grow their respective businesses. Our operating results and our ability to maintain and grow our revenues also depend upon the ability of our Managed Equity REITs ability to maintain and grow their market capitalizations and to achieve positive shareholder returns in excess of applicable REIT total shareholder return indexes. Reduced business activities, market capitalizations or shareholder returns, sales of assets or the failure of any of the Managed Equity REITs or the termination of their management agreements with us would materially reduce our revenues and our profitability.\nOur revenues may be highly variable.\nRMR LLC\u2019s business management agreement with each Managed Equity REIT provides for a base business management fee that is based on the lower of the average historical costs of the Managed Equity REIT\u2019s assets under management or its average market capitalization, as calculated in accordance with the applicable business management agreement, and an incentive business management fee that is based on the Managed Equity REIT\u2019s relative outperformance of a specified REIT total shareholder return index. The management fees we earn under these agreements are highly variable. For example, the base business management fee payable by a Managed Equity REIT may increase or decrease materially as the Managed Equity REIT acquires or disposes of real estate assets or its market capitalization increases or decreases. In addition, our earning incentive fees under these agreements is not assured; we generally only earn an incentive business management fee under our business management agreement with a Managed Equity REIT if it outperforms an identified REIT total shareholder return index during the measurement period and certain other conditions are satisfied, as measured at the end of the applicable measurement period. The shareholder returns realized by a Managed Equity REIT, its market capitalization and its ability to raise capital or make investments may be impacted by trends in the Managed Equity REIT\u2019s portfolio, the U.S. real estate industry generally, the Managed Equity REIT\u2019s industry specifically or other factors that are outside of our or its control. Further, the fees we earn under our property management agreements with the Managed Equity REITs are based on a percentage of the rents our Managed Equity REITs receive and a percentage of the costs of construction, in each case, at properties we manage for them. To the extent our Managed Equity REITs receive reduced rent or incur lower construction costs, our revenues may significantly decline. Also, the fees under our management agreements with the Managed Operators are based on a percentage of revenues (in the case of TA, gross fuel margin and nonfuel revenues) earned by them or generated at the properties they manage. A material decline in those revenues may significantly reduce our revenues.\nWe may not realize the level of revenues we have earned in the past under our management agreements and advisory agreements with our Client Companies and the amount of fees we receive may decrease. The revenues we earn may fluctuate significantly and may materially decline. For example, in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, incentive business management fees earned from the Managed Equity REITs were 39.9%, 44.3% and 22.6%, respectively, of our management and advisory services revenues. If we do not earn incentive fees, our future revenues may be significantly less than our historical revenues. Additionally, OPI and SNH are executing on their stated goals of disposing up to $700 million and $900 million, respectively, in assets, and SVC has stated that it intends to sell up to $800 million in assets, in each case as part of their near term capital plans to reduce leverage. These sales could reduce our business and property management services revenue, despite our Client Companies\u2019 acquisition activities, including SVC\u2019s acquisition in September 2019 of a portfolio of net leased properties for $2.4 billion. Additionally, our business management fees and incentive management fees are also adversely impacted when Managed Equity REITs\u2019 share prices decline. Due to recent declines in the share prices of our Managed Equity REITs, most notably OPI and SNH, we could experience adverse impacts to our operating results.\nOur management and advisory agreements with our Client Companies are subject to termination, and any such termination could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur management and advisory agreements with our Client Companies may be terminated by a Client Company or by us in certain circumstances. Depending upon the circumstances of a termination, we may or may not be entitled to receive a termination fee. If any of our management or advisory agreements with a Client Company is terminated, we may be unable to replace the lost revenue. Even if we receive a termination fee upon the termination of a management agreement with a Client Company, we may be unable to invest the after tax proceeds from the termination fee we receive in opportunities that earn returns equal to or greater than the revenues lost as a result of the terminated management agreement. The termination of our management agreement or advisory agreement with any of our Client Companies could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe commercial real estate industry has been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the United States generally.\nOur business and operations are significantly dependent on conditions in the commercial real estate industry, which in turn is impacted by general economic conditions in the United States. Commercial real estate markets in the United States were significantly negatively impacted during the most recent recession. Although commercial real estate markets have improved, with valuations approaching, and in some cases exceeding, 2007 levels, new challenges have arisen, including uncertain U.S. Federal Reserve policy regarding interest rates, increasing real estate development activities, recent declines in global economic conditions and global trade policies and actions. Adverse conditions in the commercial real estate industry and declining real estate values could harm our business and financial condition by limiting our and our Client Companies\u2019 access to debt and equity capital and our and their ability to grow our and their businesses. Adverse conditions may also give rise to an increase in tenant defaults under our Client Companies\u2019 leases, defaults of TRMT\u2019s loans and other investments, and decreased market capitalizations for the Managed Equity REITs. An economic slowdown or recession or declining real estate values could materially and adversely affect us and our Client Companies.\nThe asset management business is highly competitive.\nOur business is highly competitive, and our success will be determined by a variety of factors, including, without limitation, the following:\n\u2022\nother asset managers may have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and more personnel than our Client Companies and we do;\n\u2022\nother asset managers may offer more services than we do or may be more adept at developing, marketing and managing new services than we are;\n\u2022\nour Client Companies may not perform as well as other companies, including companies managed by other asset managers;\n\u2022\nother asset managers and the companies that compete with our Client Companies may have access to more capital or access to capital at lower costs than our Client Companies and we do;\n\u2022\nother asset managers may have stronger ties within certain industries or communities from which they identify investment opportunities;\n\u2022\nother asset managers and the companies that compete with our Client Companies may have higher risk tolerance, different risk assessment or a lower return threshold, which could allow them to acquire a wider variety of assets and a broader range of investments and as a result we and our Client Companies may grow our business less and more slowly than those competitors;\n\u2022\nthere are few barriers to entry into the asset management business, and the successful efforts of new entrants into the asset management business are expected to continue to result in increased competition;\n\u2022\nother asset managers may have better expertise or be regarded by potential clients as having better expertise with regard to specific assets or investments;\n\u2022\nother asset managers may have more scalable platforms and may operate more efficiently than we do;\n\u2022\nother asset managers may have better brand recognition than we have, and there is no assurance that we will maintain a positive brand in the future;\n\u2022\nour competitors may from time to time recruit our employees away from us; and\n\u2022\nthe market for qualified professionals is intensely competitive, and our ability to continue to compete effectively will also depend upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate our key and talented personnel.\nIf we fail to compete effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely impacted.\nChanges in market interest rates may significantly reduce our revenues or impede our growth.\nChanges in market interest rates may be sudden and may significantly reduce our revenues or impede our growth. Since the most recent U.S. economic recession, the U.S. Federal Reserve has taken actions which have resulted in low interest rates prevailing in the marketplace for a historically long period of time. The U.S. Federal Reserve steadily increased the targeted federal funds rate over the last several years, but recently took action to decrease its federal funds rate and may continue to make adjustments in the near future. Increases in market interest rates may materially and negatively affect us. One of the factors that investors typically consider important in deciding whether to buy or sell the common shares of our Managed REITs is the distribution rate with respect to such shares relative to prevailing market interest rates. If market interest rates go up, investors may expect a higher distribution rate before investing in a Managed REIT or they may sell the Managed REITs\u2019 common shares and seek alternate investments with a higher distribution rate. Sales of common shares of the Managed Equity REITs may cause a decline in the market prices of such shares, which reduces the market capitalizations and total shareholder returns of the Managed Equity REITs, which, in turn, may materially reduce the fees we earn under our business management agreements with them. Moreover, an increase in interest rates could raise borrowing costs for our Client Companies, negatively impact their access to capital to fund future growth, reduce their earnings and total shareholder returns and cause borrowers from TRMT to default, which may materially reduce the fees we earn under our business management agreements with our Client Companies.\nLow market interest rates, particularly if they remain over a sustained period, may result in increased use of debt capital to fund property acquisitions, lower capitalization rates for property purchases and increased competition for property purchases, which may reduce the amount of property acquisitions by our Client Companies and, in turn, impede our ability to grow and realize increased management fees from our Client Companies.\nSignificant legal proceedings may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe and our clients are subject to the risk of litigation, derivative claims, securities class actions, regulatory and governmental investigations and other litigation including proceedings arising from investor dissatisfaction with the performance of our clients and our clients\u2019 relationships with us and amongst themselves. If any claims were brought against us and resulted in a finding of substantial legal liability, the finding could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us, which could significantly adversely impact our business. Allegations of improper conduct by private litigants or regulators, regardless of veracity, may harm our reputation, impact our relationship with our Client Companies and adversely impact the ability of our Client Companies and us to grow our respective businesses.\nIf we cannot retain and motivate our key and talented personnel and recruit, retain and motivate new talented personnel, our business, results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur continued success depends to a great extent on our ability to retain and motivate our key and talented personnel and strategically to recruit, retain and motivate new talented personnel. However, we may not be successful in these efforts as the market for qualified employees in the asset management industry is extremely competitive. Historically we have not had employment agreements with our key employees and we have no present intention to enter into any. Our ability to recruit, retain and motivate our personnel is dependent on our ability to offer attractive compensation, opportunities for professional growth and a desirable work environment. In addition, our Client Companies have historically granted equity awards to our officers and certain other employees of ours. If our Client Companies reduce the amount of, or stop making, similar grants in the future, or if the value of any equity awards they may grant are lower than anticipated, we may need to increase the amount of compensation we pay to offset the reduction in compensation our officers and other applicable employees would otherwise receive. In order to recruit and retain existing and future personnel, we may need to increase the level of compensation that we pay to them, which may cause a higher amount of our revenue to be paid out in the form of compensation, which may have an adverse impact on our profits.\nWe depend on our controlling shareholder and other key and talented personnel.\nWe depend on the efforts, skills, reputations and business contacts of our controlling shareholder, Adam D. Portnoy, and other key and talented personnel. The extent and nature of the experience of our executive officers and of the relationships they have with real estate professionals and financial institutions, although not a guarantee of positive results, are critical to the success of our business. The loss of the services of any of them or the loss of investor confidence in such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating income and cash flows and could impair our ability to maintain or grow assets under management in our Client Companies or otherwise maintain or grow our business.\nWe do not have significant experience managing a mortgage REIT or a private real estate investment fund.\nWith our acquisition of the Tremont business in 2016 and the closing of the initial public offering of TRMT in 2017, we entered the commercial real estate finance business. We do not have significant experience in this business, and our only experience managing a mortgage REIT is with TRMT. It took longer to invest TRMT\u2019s capital than originally expected. In recognition of this longer investment period, Tremont Advisors agreed to waive the base management fee payable by TRMT for the period July 1, 2018 through June 30, 2020 and any incentive management fee that it may earn for the 2018 or 2019 calendar years. TRMT\u2019s success, the return on our $17.7 million investment in TRMT common shares and the payment of the base management and incentive management fees, if any, payable to Tremont Advisors under its management agreement with TRMT after the waiver period will depend on numerous factors, including TRMT\u2019s ability to make investments that generate attractive, risk-adjusted returns, as well as its ability to access financing on acceptable terms. Additionally, based on the length of time and the extent to which the market value of our TRMT investment was below our carrying value during the 2018 and 2019 fiscal years, we determined that the declines in fair value was other than temporary. Accordingly, we recorded impairments of $4.4 million and $6.2 million on our investment in TRMT during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2019, respectively, to reduce the carrying value to its fair value. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in this business, that TRMT will achieve its objectives and operate successfully, or that we will earn fees from TRMT sufficient to recover the costs we have incurred or to provide a suitable return on our investment in TRMT.\nIn 2018, we entered the private, open end, real estate investment fund market through the formation of and our agreement to invest up to $100.0 million in the Open End Fund, our payment of approximately $1.6 million of costs related to the organization and commencement of the Open End Fund and our agreement to manage the Open End Fund. We have no experience investing in or managing a private real estate fund. The Open End Fund may not be successful in raising additional funds to further expand or successfully operate. There can be no assurance that the Open End Fund will achieve its objectives, or that it will identify and invest successfully in properties. The Open End Fund\u2019s success, the return on our investment in the Open End Fund and fees payable to RMR LLC under its management agreements with the Open End Fund will depend on numerous factors, including its ability to make investments that generate attractive, risk-adjusted returns, as well as its ability to access financing on acceptable terms. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in managing this business, that the Open End Fund will achieve its objectives and operate successfully, or that we will earn fees from the Open End Fund sufficient to recover the costs we have incurred or to provide a suitable return on our investment in the Open End Fund.\nWe are subject to substantial regulation and numerous contractual obligations and internal policies, and failure to comply with these provisions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to substantial regulation and numerous contractual obligations and internal policies. We are subject to regulation by the SEC, the Nasdaq, and other federal, state and local or international governmental bodies and agencies or self-regulatory organizations. Moreover, RMR Advisors and Tremont Advisors must comply with the Investment Advisers Act. We are also responsible for managing or assisting with the regulatory aspects of certain of our Client Companies, including the Managed REITs\u2019 compliance with applicable REIT rules, RIF\u2019s compliance with the Investment Company Act and TRMT\u2019s maintenance of its exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act. The level of regulation and supervision to which we and our Client Companies are subject varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is based on the type of business activity involved. For example, we and TRMT may also be subject to state licensing requirements to conduct lending activities. The regulations to which we and our Client Companies are subject are extensive, complex and require substantial management time and attention. Our or our Client Companies\u2019 failure to comply with any of the regulations, contractual obligations or policies applicable to it may subject us to extensive investigations, as well as substantial penalties and reputational risk, and our business and operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur lack of compliance with applicable law could result in, among other things, our inability to enforce contracts, our default under contracts (including our management agreements or advisory agreements with our Client Companies) and our ineligibility to contract with, and receive revenue from, governmental authorities and agencies, our Client Companies or other third parties. We have numerous contractual obligations with which we must comply on a continuous basis to operate our business, the default of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We have established\ninternal policies designed to ensure that we manage our business in accordance with applicable law and regulation and in accordance with our contractual obligations. These internal policies may not be effective in all regards; and, if we fail to comply with our internal policies, we could be subjected to additional risk and liability.\nIf we are unable to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, the reliability of our financial statements may be questioned and the market price of our Class A Common Shares may suffer.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires any company subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. securities laws to do a comprehensive evaluation of its and its consolidated subsidiaries\u2019 internal control over financial reporting. We are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and therefore we currently may avail ourselves of certain exemptions from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Although our management is required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting, our independent auditors are not currently required to audit and issue an opinion on our internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards under the rules. During the course of its testing, our management may identify material weaknesses or deficiencies which may not be remedied in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If our management cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our auditors identify material weaknesses in our internal controls, investors may lose confidence in our reported financial results and the market price of our Class A Common Shares may decline.\nWe rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could materially harm our business.\nThe protection of Client Companies\u2019, employee and company data is critically important to us. We rely on information technology and systems, including the Internet and cloud-based infrastructures, commercially available software and our internally developed applications, to process, transmit, store and safeguard information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and maintenance of records, which may include personal identifying information of employees and tenants and lease data. If we experience material failures, inadequacies or interruptions or security failures of our information technology, we could incur material costs and losses. Further, third party vendors could experience similar events with respect to their information technology and systems that impact the products and services they provide to us or our Client Companies. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring, as well as our internally developed applications and internal procedures and personnel, to provide security for processing, transmitting, storing and safeguarding confidential tenant, customer and vendor information, such as personally identifiable information related to our employees and others and information regarding our and our Client Companies\u2019 financial accounts. We take various actions, and we incur significant costs, to maintain and protect the operation and security of our information technology and systems, including the data maintained in those systems. However, it is possible that these measures will not prevent the systems\u2019 improper functioning or a compromise in security, such as in the event of a cyberattack or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information.\nSecurity breaches, computer viruses, attacks by hackers, online fraud schemes and similar breaches can create significant system disruptions, shutdowns, fraudulent transfer of assets or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. For example, in June 2017, we became aware that we had been a victim of criminal fraud in which a person pretending to be a representative of a seller in a property acquisition transaction provided fraudulent money wire instructions that caused money to be wire transferred to an account that was believed to be, but was not, the seller\u2019s account. See Note 6, Related Person Transactions, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information related to this fraud. The cybersecurity risks to us, our Client Companies and third party vendors are heightened by, among other things, the evolving nature of the threats faced, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography and new and increasingly sophisticated methods used to perpetuate illegal or fraudulent activities against us, including cyberattacks, email or wire fraud and other attacks exploiting security vulnerabilities in our or other third parties\u2019 information technology networks and systems or operations. Any failure to maintain the security, proper function and availability of our information technology and systems, or certain third party vendors\u2019 failure to similarly protect their information technology and systems that are relevant to our or our Client Companies\u2019 operations, or to safeguard our or our Client Companies\u2019 business processes, assets and information could result in financial losses, interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, cause us to be in default of material contracts and subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties, any of which could materially and adversely affect us.\nTwo of our subsidiaries, RMR Advisors and Tremont Advisors, are registered with the SEC as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act. Compliance with laws and regulations applicable to registered investment advisers is complex and the failure of these subsidiaries to do so may adversely impact our business.\nOur subsidiaries, RMR Advisors and Tremont Advisors, are registered with the SEC as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act. The Investment Advisers Act requires registered investment advisers to comply with numerous obligations, including compliance, record keeping, operating and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and limitations on certain activities. Investment advisers also may owe fiduciary duties to certain of their clients. These regulatory and fiduciary obligations may result in increased costs or otherwise adversely impact our business. If RMR Advisors or Tremont Advisors fails to meet its respective compliance and fiduciary obligations under the Investment Advisers Act, it may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, fines and penalties, or it may be unable or no longer permitted to provide investment advisory services to its clients, which would reduce our revenues.\nEmployee misconduct could harm us by subjecting us to significant legal liability, reputational harm and loss of business.\nThere is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. We are subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our business and our authority over the companies and assets we manage. The violation of these obligations and standards by any of our employees may adversely affect our clients and us. Our business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to our clients. If our employees improperly use or disclose confidential information, we and the concerned client could suffer serious harm to our and its reputation, financial position and current and future business relationships and face potentially significant litigation. It is not always possible to detect or deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases. If any of our employees were to engage in or be accused of misconduct, our business and our reputation could be adversely affected. Misconduct by an employee might rise to the level of a default that would permit a Client Company to terminate its management agreements or advisory agreements with us for cause and without paying a termination fee, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRMR LLC\u2019s required quarterly tax distributions may limit our ability to implement our business or pursue growth opportunities.\nThe LLC Operating Agreement requires RMR LLC to make certain pro rata distributions to each member of RMR LLC, including RMR Inc., quarterly on the basis of the assumed tax liabilities of the members. From time to time, RMR LLC\u2019s cash flows from operations may be insufficient to enable it to make required minimum tax distributions to its members. RMR LLC may have to borrow funds or sell assets to fund its distribution requirements, and thereby materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. Further, by making cash distributions rather than investing that cash in our businesses, we might risk slowing the pace of our growth, or not having a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations, new investments or unanticipated capital expenditures, should the need arise. In such event, we may not be able to implement our business and growth strategy to the extent intended. In addition, we may have to borrow additional amounts to fund our operations or make capital expenditures, in which case our borrowing costs would increase and our liquidity would be negatively impacted.\nRisks Related to the Businesses of Our Client Companies\nFive Star Senior Living Inc. and Senior Housing Properties Trust have agreed to restructure their business arrangements to address to Five Star Senior Living Inc.\u2019s financial and operating challenges, but those arrangements are subject to conditions and, even if completed, may not result in the benefits they expect and the fees we earn from them may decline.\nIn April 2019, Five Star and SNH agreed to restructure their business arrangements. Five Star and SNH entered into a transaction agreement to address financial and operating challenges Five Star faces under current challenging conditions in the senior living industry. In connection with this agreement, among other things, all of the senior living communities that SNH owns that Five Star operates will be operated by Five Star pursuant to long term management agreements and Five Star will issue shares of its common stock to SNH and SNH\u2019s shareholders such that, after giving effect to those issuances, SNH will own approximately 34% of Five Star\u2019s outstanding common stock and SNH shareholders will receive shares representing approximately 51% of Five Star\u2019s outstanding common stock. These transactions are expected to be completed on January 1, 2020, but they are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and they may be delayed or not consummated. Current conditions in the senior living industry are challenging and it is not certain whether, even if these transactions are completed, Five Star will be able to successfully operate its business or whether SNH will receive sufficient returns on its investment in its senior living communities. If Five Star is unable to operate its business successfully, the fees we earn from Five Star will decline and SNH may be materially and adversely impacted. SNH\u2019s share price has experienced significant declines, which has reduced its market capitalization and shareholder returns and resulted in our earning reduced fees from SNH. Further, in order\nto reduce leverage and adjust its investment portfolio, SNH has announced an intention to sell up to $900 million of assets. Those sales may result in further reductions in the fees we earn from SNH.\nRisks associated with our Client Companies\u2019 businesses could adversely affect their respective abilities to grow, generate revenue and pay management fees to us and, thereby, adversely affect our business.\nWe have presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K historical fees that we have earned from our Client Companies. The historical fees earned from our Client Companies, including those presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our Client Companies or of our future results. The risks associated with each Client Company\u2019s business could adversely affect its ability to carry out its business plans and objectives, and, as a result, could adversely impact its ability to pay us management or advisory fees or cause the amounts of those fees to decline. For more information see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Overview.\u201d\nRisks to our Client Companies include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe Managed Equity REITs face competition for tenants at substantially all of their properties and competing properties may be more attractive to tenants;\n\u2022\nour Client Companies face significant competition for investment opportunities from other investors, some of which have greater financial resources, including publicly traded REITs, non-traded REITs, insurance companies, banking firms, private institutional funds, private equity funds and other investors;\n\u2022\nrising interest rates may increase operating costs, reduce the value of properties and make raising capital difficult for our Client Companies, whereas a sustained period of low interest rates may increase the amount of debt capital available, which may result in declining capitalization rates for property acquisitions and impede the growth of our Client Companies\u2019 businesses;\n\u2022\nchanging general economic and financial market conditions could significantly reduce the value of the real estate, loans and other investments of our Client Companies and reduce the amounts earned on those investments;\n\u2022\nthe real estate and real estate related investments of our Client Companies may be less liquid than other investments, and the ability of our Client Companies to adjust their portfolios in response to changes in economic or other conditions may be limited;\n\u2022\nchanges in investor preferences or market conditions could limit our Client Companies\u2019 ability to raise capital to competitively maintain their properties and operations or make new investments;\n\u2022\nshareholder activism, complaints about management strategies and structures, corporate governance and other matters may divert management attention and be disruptive to the operation of our Client Companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, regulation or accounting rules may make certain types of investments in or by our Client Companies less valuable;\n\u2022\nour Client Companies are exposed to environmental, building and other laws, natural disasters and other factors beyond their control as a result of their investment in real estate;\n\u2022\nour Client Companies have significant investments in certain types of assets, such as hotels, senior living communities, healthcare properties and travel centers, and market changes which impact these specific types of assets (e.g., new competition for short term accommodations, changes in Medicare and Medicaid rates and fuel efficiency improvements) may adversely impact certain of the Client Companies\u2019 ability to maintain or grow their business;\n\u2022\nthe failure of a Managed REIT to continue to qualify as a REIT would subject it to U.S. federal income tax and reduce cash available for distributions to its shareholders, adversely impacting its ability to raise capital and operate its business; and\n\u2022\ncomplying with REIT requirements may cause a Managed REIT to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments.\nMany of our Client Companies are SEC registrants and file reports with the SEC as required by the Exchange Act. A discussion of the businesses and the risks associated with the businesses of our Client Companies that are SEC registrants is contained in the reports filed by our Client Companies, including in the section captioned \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in each Managed\nREIT\u2019s, Five Star\u2019s and TA\u2019s Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, as those Risk Factors may have been updated or supplemented in those companies\u2019 Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed subsequently, and RIF\u2019s applicable filings with the SEC.

As a result, a significant amount of the economic interest in RMR LLC is not represented in our public float, which may adversely impact trading in our Class A Common Shares. There can be no assurance that an active trading market for our Class A Common Shares will be sustained in the future.\nThe market price of our Class A Common Shares may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\na relatively thin trading market for our Class A Common Shares could cause trades of small blocks of shares to have a significant impact on the price of our Class A Common Shares;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other comparable companies;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us, our Client Companies or our competitors of significant investments, acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u2022\nthe inclusion, exclusion, or deletion of our Class A Common Shares from any trading indices;\n\u2022\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover our Class A Common Shares;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or in our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022\noverall market fluctuations; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions.\nStock markets in general often experience volatility that is unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A Common Shares. Our shareholders may not be able to resell their Class A Common Shares following periods of volatility because of the market\u2019s adverse reaction to volatility.\nThe reduced disclosure requirements applicable to us as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d may make our Class A Common Shares less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may avail ourselves of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements of public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, but not limited to, an exemption from complying with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirement of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and obtaining shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may remain an emerging growth company until September 30, 2021, although, based on the current market value of our nonaffiliated public float of our Class A Common Shares, we currently expect that we may cease to be an emerging growth company as of September 30, 2020. If some investors find our Class A Common Shares less attractive as a result of the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A Common Shares, and the trading price of our Class A Common Shares may be more volatile than that of an otherwise comparable company that does not avail itself of the same or similar exemptions. We cannot predict if investors will find our Class A Common Shares less attractive because we rely on the JOBS Act exemptions.\nOur shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership in us may be diluted in the future.\nOur shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership in us may be diluted in the future because of our future issuance of equity or equity linked securities and our grant of equity awards to our directors, executive officers and employees.\nSome investors may be precluded from investing in our Class A Common Shares as a result of our dual class capital structure, which may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A Common Shares.\nIn July 2017, S&P Dow Jones, a provider of widely followed stock indices, announced that companies with multiple share classes, such as ours, will not be eligible for inclusion in certain of their indices. In addition, several stockholder advisory firms have announced their opposition to the use of multiple class structures. As a result, our Class A Common Shares will likely not be eligible for these stock indices and may cause stockholder advisory firms to publish negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or otherwise seek to cause us to change our capital structure. In September 2017, FTSE Russell, another provider of widely followed stock indices, adopted rules requiring new constituents of its indices to have at least five percent of their voting rights in the hands of public stockholders. Many investment funds are precluded from investing in companies that are not included in such indices, and these funds would be unable to purchase our Class A Common Shares. We cannot assure you that other stock indices will not take a similar approach to S&P Dow Jones or FTSE Russell in the future. Exclusion from indices could make our Class A Common Shares less attractive to investors and, as a result, the market price of our Class A Common Shares could be adversely affected. Additionally, any actions or publications by stockholder advisory firms critical of our corporate governance practices or capital structure could also adversely affect the value of our Class A Common Shares.\nOur dividend policy is subject to change.\nRMR Inc. currently plans to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend equal to $0.38 per share ($1.52 per share per year) to holders of its Class A Common Shares. However, the amount of distributions RMR LLC may make in the future is not certain, and there is no assurance that future distributions will be made. The declaration and payment of dividends to our shareholders will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors, which may change the distribution policy or discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. Any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Class A Common Shares.\nRisks Related to Our Relationships with Our Controlling Shareholder and Our Client Companies\nOur controlling shareholder controls our voting power, and our other shareholders will have less influence over our business than shareholders of most other publicly owned companies.\nSubstantially all of the voting power in RMR Inc. and a majority of the economic interest in RMR LLC is held by ABP Trust, an entity controlled by its sole trustee and one of our Managing Directors, Adam D. Portnoy. RMR Inc. is the managing member of RMR LLC. As of September 30, 2019, Adam D. Portnoy beneficially owned, in aggregate, directly and indirectly through ABP Trust, (i) 144,502 shares of our Class A Common Shares; (ii) all of our outstanding Class B-1 Common Shares; (iii) all of our outstanding Class B-2 Common Shares; and (iv) approximately 49.5% of our outstanding Class A Units of RMR LLC. Our Class B-1 Common Shares and Class B-2 Common Shares entitle holders to ten votes per share. As a result of this ownership, as of September 30, 2019, Adam D. Portnoy beneficially owned in aggregate, directly and indirectly through ABP Trust, a combined direct and indirect 51.6% economic interest in RMR LLC and controlled 91.4% of the aggregate voting power of our outstanding capital stock. As a result of this voting control, Adam D. Portnoy is effectively able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring shareholder approval, including, but not limited to, election of our directors. Adam D. Portnoy is able to cause or prevent a change of control of RMR Inc., and this voting control could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of RMR Inc. The voting control of Adam D. Portnoy could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their Class A Common Shares as part of a sale of us and may affect the market price of our Class A Common Shares.\nOur management agreements with the Managed Equity REITs may discourage our change of control.\nEach Managed Equity REIT may terminate its management agreements with us if we experience a change of control, as defined in those agreements, without payment of any termination fee. We may be unable to duplicate the long term management arrangements we have with each of the Managed Equity REITs. For these reasons, the management agreements may discourage a change of control of us, including a change of control which might result in payment of a premium for our Class A Common Shares.\nThe registration of two of our subsidiaries under the Investment Advisers Act may discourage our change of control.\nTwo of our subsidiaries, RMR Advisors and Tremont Advisors, are registered as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act. Any change in control of RMR Advisors or Tremont Advisors, as defined in and interpreted pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act, would trigger a shareholder approval right by RIF shareholders, TRMT or other advisory clients of RMR Advisors or Tremont Advisors as applicable, under that Act. The need for such approval may discourage a change of control of us, including a change of control which might result in payment of a premium for our Class A Common Shares.\nThe ability of ABP Trust to sell its ownership stake in us and speculation about any such sale may adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Shares.\nABP Trust controls 100.0% of our Class B-1 Common Shares (which are exchangeable for Class A Common Shares) and Class B-2 Common Shares, some of our currently outstanding Class A Common Shares and approximately 49.5% of our Class A Units of RMR LLC (which ABP Trust may cause RMR LLC to redeem for, at our election, Class A Common Shares on a one for one basis or cash). Thus, a significant portion of our ownership is not trading in the public markets. ABP Trust may sell any or all of their Class A Common Shares at any time without approval by other shareholders of RMR Inc. Speculation by the press, stock analysts, our shareholders or others regarding the intention of ABP Trust to dispose of Class A Common Shares could adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Shares. Moreover, the market price of our Class A Common Shares may be adversely impacted by the fact that a significant amount of our outstanding shares are not included in the public float of our Class A Common Shares and by our dual-stock structure. Accordingly, our Class A Common Shares may be worth less than they would be if the Class A Common Shares that ABP Trust controls or has a right to acquire were trading in the public markets.\nWe and our Client Companies are party to transactions with related parties that may increase the risk of allegations of conflicts of interest, and such allegations may impair our or our Client Companies' ability to realize the benefits we expect from these transactions.\nWe and our Client Companies are party to transactions with related parties, including with entities controlled by Adam D. Portnoy and entities that we manage. For example, because of the relationships among us, Adam D. Portnoy, Barry M. Portnoy, before his death, and our Client Companies, the agreements we are party to with them, including our management agreements, are among related parties. Other examples include: the general partner of the Open End Fund is a subsidiary controlled by ABP Trust and ABP Trust and RMR LLC are the limited partners of the Open End Fund; SVC is TA\u2019s principal landlord, and TA is SVC\u2019s largest tenant, operating travel center locations owned by SVC pursuant to long term leases; SNH is Five Star\u2019s principal landlord and Five Star is SNH\u2019s largest tenant and manager of senior living communities, operating senior living communities owned by SNH pursuant to long term agreements, and SNH and Five Star have agreed to restructure their business arrangements so that all senior living communities owned by SNH that Five Star operates will be operated by Five Star pursuant to long term management agreements and Five Star will issue shares of its common stock to SNH and SNH\u2019s shareholders such that, after giving effect to those issuances, SNH will own approximately 34% of Five Star\u2019s outstanding common stock and SNH shareholders will receive shares representing approximately 51% of Five Star\u2019s outstanding common stock; and Sonesta manages a number of SVC\u2019s hotels pursuant to long term management agreements. Our and our Client Companies\u2019 agreements with related parties or in respect of transactions among related parties may not be on terms as favorable to us as they would have been if they had been negotiated among unrelated parties. Moreover, we are subject to the risk that our shareholders or the shareholders of one or more of our Client Companies may challenge any such related party transactions and the agreements entered into as part of them. If such a challenge were to be successful, we or our Client Companies might not realize the benefits expected from the transactions being challenged. Moreover, any such challenge could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention, could have a material adverse effect on our or our Client Companies\u2019 reputation, business and growth and could adversely affect our or our Client Companies\u2019 ability to realize the benefits expected from the transactions, whether or not the allegations have merit or are substantiated.\nOur management responsibilities to each of our Client Companies and any future companies we may manage may give rise to actual, potential or perceived conflicts of interest.\nSome of our Client Companies have overlapping investment objectives. Additionally, some of our Client Companies have material business relationships with, and in some instances have entered into material transactions with, other of our Client Companies that could give rise to conflicting interests. Our controlling shareholder\u2019s investment in some of our Client Companies also could give rise to conflicting interests. Our Client Companies rely on information and management services we provide to them. While we and our Client Companies have policies and procedures in place that are intended to mitigate the risks of conflicts of interest, our allocation of investment opportunities and cost reimbursements, advice, recommendations and commitments of our management team across our Client Companies might be perceived to favor one Client Company at the expense of another.\nIn addition to serving on our Board of Directors and executive team, Adam D. Portnoy also serves on the boards of each of the Managed REITs, Managed Operators, RIF, AIC, ABP Trust, as the chair of the boards of the Managed Equity REITs, Five Star and TA, and as the general partner of the Open End Fund. Other of our officers also serve as officers or on the boards of the Managed REITs, Managed Operators, RIF and the general partner of the Open End Fund. These individuals may also hold equity positions in, or other positions with, us and these Client Companies. In addition, several of the independent trustees and independent directors of our public Client Companies also serve as independent trustees or independent directors of other public Client Companies. Some of our Client Companies have participated in a combined insurance program through AIC and we and the Managed REITs, Five Star and TA participate in a combined directors and officers insurance program. These multiple responsibilities and varying interests could create competition for the time and efforts of Adam D. Portnoy and RMR LLC and its subsidiaries and their officers and employees, and actual, potential or perceived conflicts of interest may arise.\nShareholder litigation, dissident shareholder director nominations and dissident shareholder proposals have often been instituted against companies alleging conflicts of interest in business dealings with affiliated and related persons and entities. Our relationships with Adam D. Portnoy and our Client Companies, the position of our Managing Directors and executive officers as directors, trustees or executive officers of our Client Companies, the position of independent trustees and independent directors of our public Client Companies as independent trustees or independent directors of other public Client Companies and the relationships among our Client Companies may precipitate such activities. In addition, certain proxy advisory firms which have significant influence over the voting by shareholders of public companies, have, in the past, recommended that shareholders vote against, or withhold votes for, the election of all board members up for election at our Client Companies. At past 2017 and 2018 annual shareholder meetings of SVC and SNH and at the 2019 annual shareholder meeting of ILPT, less than a majority of the votes cast were in favor of the election of at least one of the board members standing for election. Proxy advisory firms may recommend that shareholders of our public Client Companies vote against, or withhold votes for, the election of board members of such Client Companies at future annual shareholder meetings, which may affect the outcome of those elections and impact the governance of those Client Companies, which may increase the risk of shareholder activism and litigation at those Client Companies. These activities could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management\u2019s attention and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nRisks Related to Our Organization and Structure\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the Nasdaq listing rules and, as a result, qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. Our shareholders will not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nAdam D. Portnoy, as sole trustee of ABP Trust, holds more than 50.0% of the voting power of our shares eligible to vote. As a result, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the Nasdaq listing rules. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50.0% of the voting power in the election of directors is held by an individual, group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain listed company governance requirements, including the requirements that the board of directors be majority comprised of independent directors and that we have a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors. These exemptions do not modify the independence requirements for our audit committee, and we intend to continue to comply with the applicable requirements of the SEC and Nasdaq with respect to our audit committee. Nonetheless, the fact that we intend to avail ourselves of some or all of these exceptions may cause our Class A Common Shares to trade at a lower price than if these protections were provided.\nOur rights and the rights of our shareholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited.\nOur governing documents limit the liability of our directors and officers to us and our shareholders for money damages to the maximum extent permitted under Maryland law. Under current Maryland law, our directors and officers will not have any liability to us and our shareholders for money damages other than liability resulting from:\n\u2022\nactual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services; or\n\u2022\nactive and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer that was established by a final judgment as being material to the cause of action adjudicated.\nAdditionally, our governing documents require us to indemnify, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law, any of our present or former directors or executive officers who is made or threatened to be made a party to a proceeding by reason of his or her service in that capacity. We also entered into separate agreements with our directors and executive officers providing for indemnification and advancement of expenses in addition to any rights such person may have under our governing documents.\nAs a result of these limitations on liability and indemnification obligations, we and our shareholders may have more limited rights against our present and former directors and officers than might exist with other companies, which could limit shareholder recourse in the event of actions which some shareholders may believe are not in our best interest.\nOur bylaws designate the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Baltimore Division, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, manager, agents or employees.\nOur bylaws currently provide that, unless the dispute has been referred to binding arbitration, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Baltimore Division, will be the sole and exclusive forum for: (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (2) any action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, agent or employee of ours to us or our shareholders; (3) any action asserting a claim against us or any director, officer, agent or employee of ours arising pursuant to Maryland law or our charter or bylaws brought by or on behalf of a shareholder either on such shareholder\u2019s own behalf, on our behalf or on behalf of any series or class of our shareholders or shareholders against us or any of our directors, officers, agents or employees, including any claims relating to the meaning, interpretation, effect, validity, performance or enforcement of our charter or bylaws; or (4) any action asserting a claim against us or any director, officer, agent or employee of ours that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Maryland. The exclusive forum provision of our bylaws does not apply to any dispute that has been referred to binding arbitration in accordance with our bylaws. The exclusive forum provision of our bylaws does not establish exclusive jurisdiction in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland for claims that arise under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal securities laws if there is exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction in the federal courts. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in our shares of beneficial interest shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to these provisions of our bylaws, as they may be amended from time to time. The arbitration and exclusive forum provisions of our bylaws may limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the shareholder believes is favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nShareholder litigation against us or our directors, officers, employees or other agents may be referred to mandatory arbitration proceedings, which follow different procedures than in-court litigation and may be more restrictive to shareholders asserting claims than in-court litigation.\nOur shareholders agree, by virtue of becoming shareholders, that they are bound by our governing documents, including the arbitration provisions of our bylaws, as they may be amended from time to time. Our bylaws provide that certain actions by one or more of our shareholders against us or any of our directors, officers, employees or other agents will be referred to mandatory, binding and final arbitration proceedings if we, or any other party to such dispute, including any of our directors, officers, employees or other agents, unilaterally so demands. As a result, we and our shareholders would not be able to pursue litigation in state or federal court against us or our directors, officers, employees or other agents, including, for example, claims alleging violations of federal securities laws or breach of fiduciary duties or similar director or officer duties under Maryland Law, if we or any of our directors, officers, employees, agents or other parties against whom the claim is made unilaterally demands the matter be resolved by arbitration. Instead, our shareholders would be required to pursue such claims through binding and final arbitration.\nOur bylaws provide that such arbitration proceedings would be conducted in accordance with the procedures of the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, as modified in our Bylaws. These procedures may provide materially more limited rights to our shareholders than litigation in a federal or state court. For example, arbitration in accordance with these procedures does not include the opportunity for a jury trial, document discovery is limited, arbitration hearings generally are not open to the public, there are no witness depositions in advance of arbitration hearings and arbitrators may have different qualifications or experiences than judges. In addition, although our bylaws\u2019 arbitration provisions contemplate that arbitration may be brought in a representative capacity or on behalf of a class of our shareholders, the rules governing such representation or class arbitration may be different from, and less favorable to shareholders than, the rules governing representative or class action litigation in courts. Our bylaws also generally provide that each party to such an arbitration is required to bear its own costs in the arbitration, including attorneys\u2019 fees, and that the arbitrators may not render an award that includes shifting of such costs or, in a derivative or class proceeding, award any portion of our award to any shareholder or such shareholder\u2019s attorneys. The arbitration provisions of our bylaws may discourage our shareholders from bringing, and attorneys from agreeing to represent our shareholders wishing to bring, litigation against us or our directors, officers, employees, manager or other agents. A number of our contracts with Adam D. Portnoy, ABP Trust and our Client Companies have similar arbitration provisions to those in our bylaws.\nWe believe that the arbitration provisions in our bylaws are enforceable under both state and federal law, including with respect to federal securities laws claims. We are a Maryland corporation and Maryland courts have upheld the enforceability of arbitration bylaws. In addition, the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld agreements to arbitrate other federal statutory claims, including those that implicate important federal policies. However, some academics, legal practitioners and others are of the view that charter or bylaw provisions mandating arbitration are not enforceable with respect to federal securities laws claims. It is possible that the arbitration provisions of our bylaws may ultimately be determined to be unenforceable.\nBy agreeing to the arbitration provisions of our bylaws, shareholders will not be deemed to have waived compliance by us with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nRMR Inc. is required to pay ABP Trust for certain tax benefits it claims as a result of the tax basis step up we receive as part of the RMR LLC reorganization on June 5, 2015 and future redemptions by ABP Trust for Class A Common Shares or for cash. In certain circumstances, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual tax benefits RMR Inc. realizes.\nABP Trust may redeem Class A Units it owns for Class A Common Shares or cash. See \u201cBusiness-Our Organizational Structure-The RMR LLC Operating Agreement-Redemption rights of holders of Class A Units.\u201d Both ABP Trust\u2019s initial purchase of Class A Units and any future redemptions that ABP Trust may affect may result in increases in our tax basis of our assets that otherwise would not have been available. Such increases in tax basis are likely to increase (for tax purposes) depreciation and amortization deductions and therefore reduce the amount of income tax we otherwise would be required to pay in the future. These increases in tax basis may also decrease gain (or increase loss) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent the increased tax basis is allocated to those assets. The IRS may challenge all or part of these tax basis increases, and a court might sustain such a challenge.\nWe have entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement with ABP Trust that provides for the payment by RMR Inc. to ABP Trust of 85.0% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that RMR Inc. actually realizes as a result of (a) the increases in tax basis attributable to its dealings with ABP Trust and (b) tax benefits related to imputed interest deemed to be paid by us as a result of the Tax Receivable Agreement. See \u201cBusiness-Our Organizational Structure-Tax Receivable Agreement.\u201d While the actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of redemptions, the price of our Class A Common Shares at the time of the redemption, the extent to which such redemptions are taxable, and the amount and timing of our income, we expect that, as a result of the size of the increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of RMR LLC attributable to RMR Inc.\u2019s interests in RMR LLC, during the expected term of the Tax Receivable Agreement, the payments that RMR Inc. makes to ABP Trust may be substantial.\nABP Trust generally will not reimburse RMR Inc. for any payments that may have been made under the Tax Receivable Agreement. As a result, in certain circumstances RMR Inc. could make payments to ABP Trust under the Tax Receivable Agreement in excess of cash tax savings. Our ability to achieve benefits from any tax basis increase, and the payments to be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement, will depend upon a number of factors, including the timing and amount of our future income.\nIn addition, the Tax Receivable Agreement provides that, upon certain changes of control and certain breaches of the agreement that we fail to cure in accordance with the terms of the agreement, our obligations with respect to Class A Units will be accelerated. In those circumstances, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement would be based on certain assumptions, including that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits described in the Tax Receivable Agreement, and that any Class A Units that have not been redeemed will be deemed redeemed for the market value of the Class A Common Shares at the time of the change of control or breach, as applicable. Consequently, it is possible, in these circumstances, that the actual cash tax savings realized by RMR Inc. may be significantly less than the corresponding Tax Receivable Agreement payments.\nOur governing documents permit our directors and officers, our Client Companies and ABP Trust to retain corporate opportunities for their own benefit.\nUnder RMR Inc.\u2019s governing documents and RMR LLC\u2019s operating agreement, no director or officer of ours who is also serving as an officer, employee or agent of a Client Company or ABP Trust or any of its affiliates is required to present, communicate or offer any business opportunity to us, and such person shall have the right to hold any business opportunity for themselves or transfer it to any other person to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. If any of these persons fails to present an opportunity to us or takes the opportunity for themselves, to the maximum extent permitted under Maryland law they will not be liable to us. We have renounced all potential interest or expectation in certain business opportunities which may\nfit our growth objectives in the future or otherwise have value to us. These opportunities may be directed to the Client Companies or other persons or entities to which RMR LLC may have a relationship. Additionally, under our governing documents, our directors, officers, employees and agents are permitted to engage in other business activities that are similar to, or even competitive with, our own. If such persons engage in competitive business activities, we may have no remedy under our governing documents in these circumstances.\nOur governing documents do not limit our ability to enter into new lines of businesses and doing so may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our businesses.\nOur governing documents do not limit our business to the management of commercial real estate assets or businesses related thereto. Accordingly, we may pursue other business initiatives. To the extent we enter into a new line of business, we will face numerous risks and uncertainties, including risks associated with: (i) the required investment of capital and other resources; (ii) the possibility that we have insufficient expertise to engage in such activities competently or profitably; (iii) combining or integrating operational and management systems and controls; and (iv) the broadening of our geographic footprint, including the risks associated with conducting operations in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Entry into certain lines of business may subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar, or from which we are currently exempt, and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk. Our strategic initiatives may include joint ventures or partnerships, in which case we will be subject to additional risks and uncertainties because we may be dependent upon, and subject to liability, losses or reputational damage relating to systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control.\nOur only material asset is our interest in RMR LLC, and we are accordingly dependent upon distributions from RMR LLC to pay our taxes and expenses.\nRMR Inc. is organized as a holding company of RMR LLC and its only material asset is its limited liability company membership units of RMR LLC. RMR Inc. has no independent means of generating revenue. Pursuant to RMR Inc.\u2019s agreements with RMR LLC, RMR Inc., as the managing member of RMR LLC, intends to cause RMR LLC to make distributions in an amount that is at least sufficient to cover applicable taxes payable by its members, other expenses and some or all of the dividends, if any, declared by us.\nDeterioration in the financial condition, earnings or cash flow of RMR LLC for any reason could limit or impair its ability to pay such distributions to us. Additionally, to the extent that RMR Inc. requires funds and RMR LLC is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of financing or other arrangements, or is otherwise unable to provide such funds, our liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 15853, "SIC": 8741, "TIC": "RMR"}
