{"cik": "880432", "company": "MISONIX INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-09-05", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report and the exhibits hereto, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition and/or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. This section contains forward-looking statements. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations. The following list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could impact our ability to achieve results discussed in any forward-looking statement. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a recent history of net losses.\nWe have experienced losses from continuing operations during the last four fiscal years. The loss from continuing operations before income taxes was approximately $7.4 million for the 2019 fiscal year, and the accumulated deficit was approximately $21.9 million as of June 30, 2019. There can be no assurance that we will be able to return to operating profitability in the near-term or at all. As of June 30, 2019, we had a cash balance of approximately $7.8 million. Although we believe this amount is sufficient to finance our operations for at least the next 12 months, there can be no assurance that this will provide sufficient liquidity for longer-term operations or initiatives. Our cash flows may be impacted by a number of factors, including changing market conditions, market acceptance of our new and existing products, and the loss of one or more key customers. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional capital if the need arises. The failure to raise any necessary additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all, may have a material adverse effect on our future business and results of operations.\n- 7 -\nWe may incur a certain indebtedness and will require cash to service any indebtedness we incur. This cash may not be readily available to us.\nOur ability to make payments on, or repay or refinance, any indebtedness and fund planned capital expenditures will depend largely upon our future operating performance. Our future performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot be certain we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay any indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nWe are subject to extensive medical device regulation which may impede or hinder the approval process for our products and, in some cases, may not ultimately result in approval or may result in the recall or seizure of previously approved products.\nOur medical devices and our business activities are subject to rigorous regulation, including by the FDA, the DOJ and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities including the imposition of international trade sanctions and tariffs. Certain state governments and the federal government have enacted legislation aimed at increasing transparency of our interactions with health care providers. Any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could impact our business.\nThese regulations include regulations pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, by the FDA and comparable agencies in foreign countries, and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies. Under the FDC Act, medical devices must receive FDA clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the U.S. In addition, most major markets for medical devices outside the U.S. require clearance, approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed. The process of obtaining marketing approval or clearance from the FDA for new products, or with respect to enhancements or modifications to existing products, could:\n\u25cf take a significant amount of time;\n\u25cf require the expenditure of substantial resources;\n\u25cf involve rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing;\n\u25cf require changes to the products; and\n\u25cf result in limitations on the proposed uses of the products\nMarketing approvals or clearances are not the only risk. The FDA, and other regulatory bodies, also can require the withdrawal of an approved or cleared product from commercial distribution due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems.\nAs a medical device manufacturer, we are required to register with the FDA and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. In addition, FDA regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a medical device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the FDA. In the European Union and China, we are required to maintain certain ISO certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications. Failure to meet regulatory quality standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n- 8 -\nConsequently, there can be no assurance that we will receive the required clearances from the FDA or other regulatory bodies for new products or modifications to existing products on a timely basis or that any FDA approval will not be subsequently withdrawn. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and/or criminal prosecution. The failure to receive product approval clearance on a timely basis, suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products or the withdrawal of product approval by the FDA or other regulatory bodies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe face intense competition and may not be able to keep pace with the rapid technological changes in the medical device industry.\nThe medical device product market is highly competitive. We encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold from various medical device companies, most of which have greater financial and marketing resources than we do.\nAdditionally, the medical device product market is characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological change. Developments by other companies of new or improved products, processes or technology may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive and may negatively impact our revenues. In some cases, foreign companies may attempt to copy our designs illegally. We are required to devote continued efforts and financial resources to develop or acquire scientifically advanced technologies and products, apply our technologies cost-effectively across product lines and markets, attract and retain skilled development personnel, obtain patent and other protection for our technology and products, obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals and successfully manufacture and market our products. Failure to develop new products or enhance existing products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights.\nPatents, trademarks and other intangible proprietary rights are and will be essential to our business and its ability to compete effectively with other companies. We will also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations, strategic alliances and licensing opportunities to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We will pursue a policy of generally obtaining patent protection in both the U.S. and overseas for patentable subject matter in its proprietary devices and also attempt to review third-party patents and patent applications to the extent publicly available to develop an effective patent strategy, avoid infringement of third-party patents, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the patent claims of others. We also operate in an industry that is susceptible to significant intellectual property litigation and it has been common for companies in the medical device field to aggressively challenge the patent rights of other companies in order to prevent the marketing of new devices. Intellectual property litigation is expensive, complex and lengthy and its outcome is difficult to predict. Future patent litigation may result in significant royalty or other payments or injunctions that can prevent the sale of products and may significantly divert the attention of our technical and management personnel.\nIn addition, we may have to take legal action in the future to protect our patents, trade secrets or know-how or to assert our intellectual property rights against claimed infringement by others. Any legal action of that type could be costly and time consuming to us and no assurances can be made that any lawsuit will be successful.\nThe invalidation of key patents or proprietary rights that we own, or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits to protect our intellectual property, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In the event that our right to market any of our products is successfully challenged, or if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\n- 9 -\neSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business, prevent us from accessing critical information or expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including patient health information, personally identifiable information about its employees, intellectual property, and proprietary business information. We manage and maintain applications and data utilizing on-site and off-site systems. These applications and data encompass a wide variety of business-critical information including research and development information, commercial information and business and financial information.\nThe secure processing, storage, maintenance and transmission of this critical information is vital to our operations and business strategy, and we devote resources to protecting such information. Although we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers, viruses, breaches or interruptions due to employee error or malfeasance, terrorist attacks, hurricanes, fire, flood, other natural disasters, power loss, computer systems failure, data network failure, internet failure, or lapses in compliance with privacy and security mandates. Any such virus, breach or interruption could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, government enforcement actions and regulatory penalties. Unauthorized access, loss or dissemination could also interrupt our operations, including our ability to receive and ship orders from customers, bill our customers, provide customer support services, conduct research and development activities, process and prepare company financial information, manage various general and administrative aspects of our business and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nFuture product liability claims and other litigation may adversely affect our business, reputation and ability to attract and retain customers.\nThe design, manufacture and marketing of medical device products of the types that we produce entail an inherent risk of product liability claims. A number of factors could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient with respect to these or other products that we manufacture or sell, including component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information. These factors could result in product liability claims, a recall of one or more of our products or a safety alert relating to one or more of our products. Product liability claims may be brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class.\nAnyone or any company can bring an action against Misonix, including private securities litigation and shareholder derivative suits, and adverse litigation results could affect our business.\nOur judicial system allows anyone, including shareholders, to bring a claim against the Company and force the Company to defend itself even if the claim is baseless. The defense may or may not be covered by the Company\u2019s insurance, the result of which could ultimately create a burden on the Company dependent upon the outcome.\nLitigation can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to our operations, and results cannot be predicted with certainty. An adverse decision could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nOn March 23, 2017, the Company\u2019s former distributor in China, Cicel (Beijing) Science & Technology Co., Ltd., filed a lawsuit against the Company and certain officers and directors of the Company in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, alleging that the Company improperly terminated its contract with the former distributor. The complaint sought various remedies, including compensatory and punitive damages, specific performance and preliminary and post judgment injunctive relief, and asserted various causes of action, including breach of contract, unfair competition, tortious interference with contract, fraudulent inducement, and conversion. On October 7, 2017, the court granted the Company\u2019s motion to dismiss all of the tort claims asserted against it, and also granted the individual defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss all claims asserted against them. The only claim currently remaining in the case is for breach of contract against the Company; the plaintiff has moved to amend its complaint to add tort claims, which the Company has opposed. The court has not yet ruled on the motion to amend. The Company believes it has various legal and factual defenses to the allegations in the complaint and intends to vigorously defend the action. Fact discovery in the case is ongoing and there is no trial date currently set.\n- 10 -\nOn June 6, 2017, Irving Feldbaum, an individual shareholder of Misonix, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The complaint alleges claims against the Company\u2019s board of directors, its former CEO and CFO, certain of its former directors, and the Company as a nominal defendant for alleged violations of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and state law claims for breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, and unjust enrichment. The complaint alleges that the Company incurred damages as a result of alleged false and misleading statements in the Company\u2019s securities filings concerning the Company\u2019s business, operations, prospects and the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. The complaint also alleges that the Company\u2019s February 4, 2016 Proxy Statement contained false and misleading statements regarding executive compensation. The complaint seeks the recovery of damages on behalf of the Company and the implementation of changes to corporate governance procedures. On June 16, 2017, Michael Rubin, another individual shareholder of Misonix, filed a case alleging similar claims in the same district court. On July 21, 2017, the district court consolidated the two actions for all purposes. On July 26, 2019, the district court approved the settlement. Under the terms of the settlement, the Company has agreed to undertake and maintain in place certain corporate governance reforms for a period of time, and to pay counsel for Mr. Feldbaum and Mr. Rubin attorneys\u2019 fee of $500,000, which has been paid by Misonix\u2019s insurance carrier.\nViolation of anti-corruption laws could subject the Company to significant penalties which would materially affect our business and liquidity.\nWe are required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions around the world where we do business. Compliance with these laws has been subject to increasing focus and activity by regulatory authorities in recent years.\nWith the assistance of outside counsel, beginning in 2016 we conducted a voluntary investigation into the business practices of the independent Chinese entity that previously distributed our products in China and our knowledge of those business practices, which may have had implications under the FCPA, as well as into various internal control issues identified during the investigation. We did not identify any information through the investigation or otherwise that suggests that our previously reported financial statements are incorrect. On September 27, 2016 and September 28, 2016, we voluntarily contacted the SEC and the DOJ, respectively, to advise both agencies of these potential issues. Thereafter, we provided documents and information to, and cooperated fully with, the SEC and the DOJ, in their investigations of these matters.\nOn June 18, 2019, we received a letter from the Division of Enforcement of the SEC advising us that the SEC had concluded its investigation of us and that, based on the information it had as of the date of the letter, it did not intend to recommend an enforcement action by the SEC against us. On August 14, 2019, we received a declination letter from the United States Department of Justice DOJ stating that the DOJ has closed its inquiry into us without any action.\nAlthough neither the SEC or DOJ have taken any enforcement action in these matters, our investigative costs, including costs of shareholder litigation relating to these matters (which has now been settled), are approximately $3.9 million to date, of which $0.8 million, $0.5 million and $2.4 million was charged to expense during the three years ended June 30, 2019, respectively.\nFuture actions by our employees, or third-party intermediaries acting on our behalf, in violation of anticorruption laws, including the FCPA, whether carried out in the United States or elsewhere in connection with the conduct of our business may expose us to liability for violations and significant costs and expenses in investigating such actions or defending against civil or criminal charges associated therewith and accordingly may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n- 11 -\nOur future growth is dependent upon the development of new products and line extensions, which requires significant research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals, all of which are very expensive and time-consuming and may not result in a commercially viable product.\nIn order to develop new products and improve current product offerings, we focus our research and development programs largely on the development of next-generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and opportunities.\nAs a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance from the FDA for new products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial endpoints. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us, by our competitors or by third parties, or the market\u2019s perception of this clinical data, may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals from the FDA, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate and our business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects.\nNew products may not be accepted by customers in the marketplace.\nWe are now, and will continue to be, developing new products and introducing them into the market. There can be no assurance that any new product will be accepted by the market. New products are sometimes introduced into the market in a prototype format and may need later revisions or design changes before they operate in a manner to be accepted in the market. As a result of the introduction of new products, there is some risk that revenue expectations may not be met and in some cases the product may not achieve market acceptance.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to demands for price concessions or the exclusion of the Company as supplier from certain of our significant market segments.\nThe cost of healthcare has risen significantly over the past decade and numerous initiatives and reforms initiated by legislators, regulators and third-party payers to curb these costs have resulted in a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry, including hospitals. This in turn has resulted in greater pricing pressures and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments as group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for some of our hospital customers. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers and competitors, which may reduce competition, exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and may adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may experience disruption in supply due to our dependence on our suppliers to continue to ship product requirements and our inability to obtain suppliers of certain components for our products.\nOur suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing due to a variety of reasons, including poor business practices, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, failure to comply with applicable regulations, equipment malfunctions, labor shortages or environmental factors. In addition, we purchase both raw materials used in our products and finished goods from various suppliers and may have to rely on a single source supplier for certain components of our products where there are no alternatives are available. Although we anticipate that we have adequate sources of supply and/or inventory of these components to handle our production needs for the foreseeable future, if we are unable to secure on a timely basis sufficient quantities of the materials we depend on to manufacture our products, if we encounter delays or contractual or other difficulties in our relationships with these suppliers, or if we cannot find suppliers at an acceptable cost, then the manufacture of our products may be disrupted, which could increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, in fiscal 2019, we experienced certain supply chain disruptions due to suppliers not being able to keep pace with our demand for materials and product. These disruptions caused us to not be able to ship certain customer orders on time, creating a sales backlog which was higher than normal.\nIf we fail to manage any expansion or acquisition, our business could be impaired.\nWe may in the future acquire one or more technologies, products or companies that complement our business. We may not be able to effectively integrate these into our business and any such acquisition could bring additional risks, exposures and challenges to the Company. In addition, acquisitions may dilute our earnings per share, disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses, subject us to liabilities and increase our risk of litigation, all of which could harm our business. If we use cash to acquire technologies, products, or companies, such use may divert resources otherwise available for other purposes. If we use our common stock to acquire technologies, products, or companies, our shareholders may experience substantial dilution. If we fail to manage any expansions or acquisition, our business could be impaired. For specific risks related to the proposed acquisition of Solsys see \u201cRisks Related to the Proposed Acquisition of Solsys.\u201d\nOur agreements and contracts entered into with partners and other third parties may not be successful.\nWe signed in the past and may pursue in the future agreements and contracts with third parties to assist in our marketing, manufacturing, selling and distribution efforts. We cannot assure you that any agreements or contracts entered into will be successful.\nThe fluctuation of our quarterly results may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur revenues and results of operations have in the past and will likely vary in the future from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate. You should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. It is likely that in some future quarters, our results of operations may be below the expectations of the Company\u2019s public market analysts and investors. In this event, the price of our common stock may fall.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain additional key management, sales and marketing and technical personnel, or we may lose existing key management, sales and marketing or technical personnel, which may delay our development and marketing efforts.\nWe depend on a number of key management, sales and marketing and technical personnel. The loss of the services of one or more key employees could delay the achievement of our development and marketing objectives. Our success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified management, sales and marketing and technical personnel to meet our growth goals. We face intense competition for qualified personnel, many of whom are often subject to competing employment offers, and we do not know whether we will be able to attract and retain such personnel.\nFuture changes in financial accounting standards or practices or existing taxation rules or practices may cause adverse or unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations.\nA change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation practice have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.\nRisk of reprocessing disposables.\nIn some jurisdictions around the world, culture and practice encourages reuse of disposable products when the product is clearly labeled for single use. Such reuse may expose us to liability in these jurisdictions.\nOur management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are ineffective due to the existence of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired, and the market price of our securities may be negatively affected.\nA material weakness (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2019. Based upon this evaluation, management has identified a deficiency related to the design of a process level control to address the completeness and accuracy of unrecorded liabilities at June 30, 2019.\nSpecifically, the Company identified one invoice related to legal fees which was properly approved and submitted to the accounts payable department for posting, however such invoice was erroneously posted into the month of July 2019 instead of June 2019 as the result of a keypunch error. The Company\u2019s finance personnel failed to promptly identify this error and this deficiency allowed for the potential for other invoices to be misapplied. See Part II, Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d.\nTo remediate this weakness, the Company has implemented controls to review and verify that open accounts payable invoices, in addition to invoices paid after period end, are entered into the correct accounting period. This error was corrected and impacted the balance sheet only, and did not impact the statement of operations. If we are unable to remediate this material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or if we identify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, our management will be unable to assert in future reports that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting are effective. This could cause investors, counterparties and customers to lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements and reports and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, access to capital markets and perceptions of our creditworthiness and/or a decline in the market price of our common stock. In addition, we could become subject to investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources. These events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Proposed Acquisition of Solsys\nWe are subject to various risks related to the proposed acquisition of Solsys.\nWe have entered into a merger agreement with Solsys pursuant to which we will acquire Solsys. The risks, contingencies and other uncertainties that could result in the failure of the proposed acquisition to be completed or, if completed, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations following the proposed acquisition, and any anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition, include:\n\u25cf the failure to obtain necessary stockholder approvals for the share issuance and the adoption of the merger agreement;\n\u25cf the failure to satisfy required closing conditions or complete the proposed acquisition in a timely manner or at all;\n\u25cf the effect of the announcement of the proposed acquisition on each company\u2019s ability to retain and hire key personnel, maintain business relationships, and on operating results and the businesses generally;\n\u25cf the effect of restrictions placed on Solsys\u2019 business activities and ability to pursue alternatives to the proposed acquisition pursuant to the merger agreement;\n\u25cf the potential impact of the proposed acquisition on our stock price;\n\u25cf the incurrence of significant transaction related costs in connection with the proposed acquisition that are, and will be, incurred regardless of whether the proposed acquisition is completed; and\n\u25cf the occurrence of any event giving rise to the right to terminate the merger agreement.\nOur future results following the proposed acquisition will suffer if we do not effectively manage the expanded operations or successfully integrate the businesses of Solsys.\nOur future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to manage the expanded business, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. If we are not able to successfully combine the businesses of Misonix and Solsys in an efficient and effective manner, the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of our common stock may be affected adversely. An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect upon on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses.\nUncertainties associated with the transactions may cause employees to leave Misonix or Solsys and may otherwise affect our future business and operations.\nOur success after completion of the proposed acquisition will depend in part upon our ability to retain key employees. Prior to and following the proposed acquisition, current and prospective employees of Misonix and Solsys may experience uncertainty about their future roles and choose to pursue other opportunities, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If key employees depart, the integration of the two companies may be more difficult and our business following the proposed acquisition could be adversely affected.\nFailure to complete the proposed acquisition may negatively impact our share price and the future business and our financial results.\nThe merger agreement provides that either we or Solsys may terminate the merger agreement if the proposed acquisition is not completed on or before November 2, 2019.\nIf the proposed acquisition is not completed on a timely basis, our and Solsys\u2019 ongoing businesses may be adversely affected. If the proposed acquisition is not completed at all, we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25cf being required to pay costs and expenses relating to the transactions, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory and printing fees; and\n\u25cf time and resources committed by our management to matters relating to the proposed acquisition could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities.\nIf the proposed acquisition is not completed, the price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the proposed acquisition will be completed and that the related benefits will be realized, or a market perception that the proposed acquisition was not completed due to an adverse change in our business.", "PERMNO": 77282, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "MSON"}
