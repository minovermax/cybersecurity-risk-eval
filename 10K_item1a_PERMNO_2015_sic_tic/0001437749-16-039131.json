{"cik": "832488", "company": "MAM SOFTWARE GROUP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-09-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to a number of risk factors, both those that are known to us and identified below and others that may arise from time to time. These risk factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those suggested by forward-looking statements in this Report and elsewhere, and may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of these risk factors should occur, moreover, the trading price of our securities could decline, and investors in our securities could lose all or part of their investment in our securities. These risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business.\nRisks Related to MAM and Our Business\nWe may fail to address risks we face as a growing business, which could adversely affect the implementation of our business plan.\nWe are prone to all of the risks inherent in growing a business. You should consider the likelihood of our future success to be highly speculative in light of the limited resources, problems, expenses, risks and complications frequently encountered by entities at our current stage of development.\nTo address these risks, we must, among other things:\n\u2022\nimplement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy;\n\u2022\ncontinue to develop new products and upgrade our existing products;\n\u2022 respond to industry and competitive developments;\n\u2022\nattract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel; and\n\u2022\nobtain equity and debt financing on satisfactory terms and in timely fashion in amounts adequate to implement our business plan and meet our obligations.\nWe may not be successful in addressing these risks and if we do not, our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nGlobal market disruptions may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nRecent disruptions in the current global credit and financial markets have included diminished liquidity and credit availability, a decline in economic growth and uncertainty about economic stability. There can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions. These economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. We believe that the recent global economic slowdown and the resulting slow recovery have caused certain customers to reduce or delay capital spending plans, which, if prolonged, could impact our growth expectations as potential and existing customers continue to delay decisions to purchase or upgrade their systems. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions and its potential impact on our business. If the current uncertain economic conditions continue or further deteriorate, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nPolitical and economic uncertainty arising from a majority of voters approving a referendum for the United Kingdom to exit the European Union could adversely impact our financial results.\nIn June 2016, a majority of voters in the UK elected to withdraw from the European Union (E.U.) in a national referendum (also referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d). Negotiations are expected to commence to determine the future terms of the UK\u2019s relationship with the E.U. MAM UK represents a significant portion of our revenues and profitability. The announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the US dollar against the British pound. During periods of a strengthening dollar, our reported international revenues are reduced because the British pound translates into fewer US dollars. The long term effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the UK makes to retain access to European markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Any of the potential effects of Brexit could have unpredictable consequences for credit markets and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial performance.\nFinancial difficulties or the bankruptcy of one or more of our major customers could adversely affect our results.\nOur ability to collect our accounts receivable and future sales depends, in part, on the financial strength of our customers. We grant credit, generally without collateral, to our customers. Consequently, we are subject to credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors throughout the UK Market and North America. In the event customers experience financial difficulty, and particularly if bankruptcy results, our profitability may be adversely impacted by our failure to collect our accounts receivable in excess of our estimated allowance for uncollectible accounts. Additionally, our future revenues could be reduced by the loss of a customer due to bankruptcy. Our failure to collect accounts receivable and/or the loss of one or more major customers could have an adverse effect on our net income and financial condition.\nWe may fail to successfully develop, market and sell our products.\nTo achieve profitable operations, we, along with our subsidiaries, must continue successfully to improve, market and sell existing products and develop, market and sell new products. Our product development efforts may not be successful. The development of new software products is highly uncertain and subject to a number of significant risks. The development cycle-from inception to installing the software for customers - can be lengthy and uncertain. The ability to market the product is unpredictable and may cause delays. Potential products may appear promising at early stages of development, and yet may not reach the market for a number of reasons.\nWe may encounter significant financial and operating risks if we grow our business through acquisitions.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may seek to acquire or invest in complementary or competitive businesses, products or technologies. The process of integrating acquired assets into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business. We may allocate a significant portion of our available working capital to finance all or a portion of the purchase price relating to possible acquisitions. Any future acquisition or investment opportunity may require us to obtain additional financing to complete the transaction. The anticipated benefits of any acquisitions may not be realized. In addition, future acquisitions by us could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial position. Acquisitions also involve other risks, including entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience.\nAn increase in competition from other software manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue and cash flow.\nCompetition in our industry is intense. Potential competitors in the UK Market and North America are numerous. Most competitors have substantially greater capital resources, marketing experience, research and development staffs and facilities than we have. Our competitors may be able to develop products before us or develop more effective products or market them more effectively which would limit our ability to generate revenue and cash flow.\nThe prices we charge for our products may decrease as a result of competition and our revenues could decrease as a result.\nWe face potential competition from many competitors and increased competition may have a negative impact on our future revenues and financial condition. In addition, there are very large software companies, including Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation and SAP AG which supply ERP and SCM products to our target market of small to medium-sized businesses servicing the automotive aftermarket. There can be no assurance that these companies will not develop or acquire a competitive product or service in the future. Our business would be dramatically affected by price pressure if these larger software companies attempted to gain market share through the use of highly discounted sales and extensive marketing campaigns.\nIf we fail to keep up with rapid technological change, our technologies and products could become less competitive or obsolete.\nThe software industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological change. We expect that the software needs associated with the automotive technology will continue to develop rapidly, and our future success will depend on our ability to develop and maintain a competitive position through technological development.\nWe depend on proprietary know-how to develop and protect our technologies and products, which rights may not offer us sufficient protection.\nThe software industry places considerable importance on obtaining intellectual property protection for new technologies, products and processes. Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and enforce protection for products that we develop, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties.\nWe rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. We may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets which could limit our ability to exclusively produce products.\nWe require our employees, consultants, and parties to collaborative agreements to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships or collaboration with us. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection of our trade secrets or adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential and proprietary information.\nIf we become subject to adverse claims alleging infringement of third-party proprietary rights, we may incur unanticipated costs and our competitive position may suffer.\nWe are subject to the risk that we are infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. Although we are not aware of any infringement by our technology on the proprietary rights of others and are not currently subject to any legal proceedings involving claimed infringements, we cannot assure that we will not be subject to such third-party claims, litigation or indemnity demands and that these claims will not be successful. If a claim or indemnity demand were to be brought against us, it could result in costly litigation or product shipment delays or force us to stop selling such product or providing such services or to enter into royalty or license agreements.\nOur software and information services could contain design defects or errors which could affect our reputation, result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our products.\nOur software and information services are highly complex and sophisticated and could, from time to time, contain design defects or errors. We cannot assure you that these defects or errors will not delay the release or shipment of our products or, if the defect or error is discovered only after customers have received the products, that these defects or errors will not result in increased costs, litigation, customer attrition, reduced market acceptance of our systems and services or damage to our reputation.\nIf we lose key management or other personnel our business could suffer.\nWe are highly dependent on the principal members of our management staff. We also rely on consultants and advisors to assist us in formulating our development strategy. Our success also depends upon retaining key management and technical personnel, as well as our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel. We may not be successful in retaining our current personnel or hiring and retaining qualified personnel in the future. If we lose the services of any of our management staff or key technical personnel, or if we fail to continue to attract qualified personnel, our ability to acquire, develop or sell products would be adversely affected.\nOur management and internal systems might be inadequate to handle our potential growth.\nOur success will depend in significant part on the expansion of our operations and the effective management of growth. This growth will place a significant strain on our management and information systems and resources and operational and financial systems and resources. To manage future growth, our management must continue to improve our operational and financial systems and expand, train, retain and manage our employee base. Our management may not be able to manage our growth effectively. If our systems, procedures, controls, and resources are inadequate to support our operations, our expansion would be halted and we could lose our opportunity to gain significant market share. Any inability to manage growth effectively may harm our ability to institute our business plan.\nWe have insurance coverage for the services we offer. However, a claim for damages may be made against us regardless of our responsibility for the failure, which could expose us to liability.\nWe provide business management solutions that we believe are critical to the operations of our customers\u2019 businesses and provide benefits that may be difficult to quantify. Any failure of a customer\u2019s system installed or of the services offered by us could result in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for the failure. Although we attempt to limit our contractual liability for damages resulting from negligent acts, errors, mistakes or omissions in rendering our services, we cannot assure you that the limitations on liability we include in our agreements will be enforceable in all cases, or that those limitations on liability will otherwise protect us from liability for damages. In the event that the terms and conditions of our contracts which limit our liability are not sufficient, we have insurance coverage. This coverage of approximately $10 million in the aggregate in the UK Market and in North America insures the business for negligent acts, error or omission, failure of the technology services to perform as intended, and breach of warranties or representations. It also insures the services that we supply including, web services, consulting, analysis, design, installation, training, support, system integration, the manufacture, sale, licensing, distribution or marketing of software, the design and development of code, software and programming and the provision of software applications as a service, rental or lease. However, there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate or that coverage will remain available at acceptable costs. Successful claims brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage could seriously harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Even if not successful, large claims against us could result in significant legal and other costs and may be a distraction to our senior management.\nBecause we have international operations, we will be subject to risks of conducting business in foreign countries.\nInternational operations constitute a significant part of our business, and we are subject to the risks of conducting business in foreign countries, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulty in establishing or managing distribution relationships;\n\u2022\ndifferent standards for the development, use, packaging and marketing of our products and technologies;\n\u2022\nour ability to locate qualified local employees, partners, distributors and suppliers;\n\u2022\nthe potential burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws and trade standards; and\n\u2022\ngeneral geopolitical risks, such as political and economic instability, changes in diplomatic and trade relations, and foreign currency risks and fluctuations.\nNo assurance can be given that we will be able to positively manage the risks inherent in the conduct of our international operations or that such operations will not have a negative impact on our overall financial operations.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur insiders and affiliated beneficially own a significant portion of our stock.\nAs of the date of hereof, our executive officers, directors and affiliated parties beneficially own approximately 65% of our common stock. As a result, our executive officers and affiliated parties will have significant influence to:\n\u2022 Elect or defeat the election of our directors;\n\u2022\nAmend or prevent amendment of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws;\n\u2022\nEffect or prevent a merger, sale of assets or other corporate transaction; and\n\u2022\nAffect the outcome of any other matter submitted to the stockholders for vote\nIn addition, any sale of a significant amount of our common stock held by our directors and executive officers, or the possibility of such sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Management's stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing any gains from our common stock.\nAdditional issuances of securities will dilute your stock ownership and could affect our stock price.\nAs of September 16, 2016, there were 13,190,546 shares of our common stock issued and 12,400,758 shares of our common stock outstanding. Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of an aggregate of 18,000,000 shares of common stock and 2,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, on such terms and at such prices as our Board of Directors may determine. These shares are intended to provide us with the necessary flexibility to undertake and complete plans to raise funds if and when needed. In addition, we may pursue acquisitions that could include issuing equity, although we have no current arrangements to do so. Any such issuances of securities would have a dilutive effect on current ownership of MAM stock. The market price of our common stock could fall in response to the sale or issuance of a large number of shares, or the perception that sales of a large number of shares could occur.\nThe market for our common stock is limited and you may not be able to sell your common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market. The market for purchases and sales of our common stock is limited and therefore the sale of a relatively small number of shares could cause the price to fall sharply. Accordingly, it may be difficult to sell shares quickly without significantly depressing the value of the common stock. Unless we are successful in developing continued investor interest in our common stock, sales of our common stock could continue to result in major fluctuations in the price of the common stock.\nThe price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and subject to fluctuations.\nThe market price of the securities of software companies has been especially volatile. Additionally, the lack of trading volume for our common stock may cause the market price of our common stock to be subject to fluctuations. If our revenues do not grow or grow more slowly than we anticipate, or, if operating or capital expenditures exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly, or if some other event adversely affects us, the market price of our common stock could decline. If the stock market in general experiences a loss in investor confidence or otherwise fails, the market price of our common stock could fall for reasons unrelated to our business, results of operations and financial condition. The market price of our common stock also might decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us.\nIt may be difficult for shareholders to recover against those of our directors and officers that are not residents of the US.\nOne of our directors, who is also an executive officer, is a resident of the UK. In addition, our significant operating subsidiary, MAM Software Limited is located in the UK. Were one or more shareholders to bring an action against us in the US and succeed, either through default or on the merits, and obtain a financial award against an officer or director of MAM, that shareholder may be required to enforce and collect on his or her judgment in the UK, unless the officer or director owned assets which were located in the US. Further, shareholder efforts to bring an action in the UK against its citizens for any alleged breach of a duty in a foreign jurisdiction may be difficult, as prosecution of a claim in a foreign jurisdiction, and in particular a foreign nation, is fraught with difficulty and may be effectively, if not financially, unfeasible.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of MAM. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include\n\u2022\nauthorizing the board to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with rights senior to those of our common stock;\n\u2022\nlimiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals.\nIn addition, the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law govern us. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time without the consent of our board of directors.\nThese and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and result in the market price of our common stock being lower than it would be without these provisions.\nIf we are not able to comply with the applicable continued listing requirements or standards of the NASDAQ Capital Market, NASDAQ could delist our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market. In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other continued listing requirements and standards, including those regarding director independence and independent committee requirements, minimum stockholders\u2019 equity, minimum share price, and certain corporate governance requirements. There can be no assurances that we will be able to comply with the applicable listing standards.\nIn the event that our common stock is delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market and is not eligible for quotation on another market or exchange, trading of our common stock could be conducted in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the Pink Sheets or the OTC Bulletin Board. In such event, it could become more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate price quotations for, our common stock, and there would likely also be a reduction in our coverage by securities analysts and the news media, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline further. Also, it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital if we are not listed on a major exchange.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our common stock adversely, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our shares of common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our common stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our share price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, and any return on investment may be limited to potential future appreciation on the value of our common stock.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings to support the development and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the foreseeable future. Our payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including without limitation, our financial condition, operating results, cash needs, growth plans and the terms of any credit agreements that we may be a party to at the time. To the extent we do not pay dividends, our shares of common stock may be less valuable because a return on investment will only occur if and to the extent our stock price appreciates, which may never occur. In addition, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation as the only way to realize their investment, and if the price of our common stock does not appreciate, then there will be no return on investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.", "PERMNO": 13931, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "MAMS"}
