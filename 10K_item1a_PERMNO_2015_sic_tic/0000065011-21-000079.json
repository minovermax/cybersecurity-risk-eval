{"cik": "65011", "company": "MEREDITH CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-09-10", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K, investors should consider the following risk factors carefully when investing in our securities. In addition to the risks described below, there may be additional risks that we have not yet perceived or that we currently believe are immaterial.\nRisks Relating to the Separation, Distribution, and Spin-Off\nMeredith\u2019s and Gray\u2019s inability to obtain all material authorizations, consents, approvals and clearances of third parties including U.S. federal agencies (Third-Party Approvals) in connection with the Distribution and\nmerger may have a material adverse effect on Meredith\u2019s ability to consummate the Distribution. There are numerous Third-Party Approvals that Meredith and Gray must obtain in connection with the Distribution and the restructuring of Meredith\u2019s business in connection therewith, including approvals by regulatory authorities. In some cases, these approvals must be obtained before the Distribution can be completed. Although Meredith and Gray have commenced the process of seeking the necessary Third-Party Approvals required in connection with the distribution, they currently do not have all the necessary Third-Party Approvals. There is no assurance that Meredith and Gray will be able to obtain these Third-Party Approvals.\nThe Merger may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated or at all. Failure to complete the transaction could negatively impact the stock price and the future business and financial results of Meredith. The completion of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including (1) approval by Meredith shareholders, (2) the expiration or termination of the required waiting period under the HSR Act, (3) the receipt of FCC consent, (4) the absence of certain legal impediments, (5) a cash payment by NMG SpinCo to Meredith, (6) completion of the Spin-Off, and (7) other customary closing conditions, as well as conditions unique to Gray and its subsidiary Gray Hawkeye Stations, Inc., on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand.\nCompletion of the Spin-Off (and therefore the Merger) is subject to certain conditions, including (1) the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger (other than those conditions that by their nature are satisfied at the closing), (2) consummation of the SpinCo debt financing, (3) effectiveness of a Registration Statement on Form 10 regarding NMG SpinCo Common Stock, (4) receipt by the Company and NMG SpinCo of a solvency opinion, (5) the acceptance of NMG SpinCo Common Stock for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, (5) the absence of certain legal impediments, and (6) other customary closing conditions.\nWe cannot assure you that the Merger and Spin-Off will be consummated on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all. We have expended and will continue to expend a significant amount of time and resources on the transaction, and a failure to consummate the transaction as currently contemplated, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on Meredith\u2019s business and results of operations. If the Merger is not completed, the ongoing business of Meredith may be adversely affected and Meredith will be subject to several risks, including the following:\n\u2022the Spin-Off will not be completed;\n\u2022being required, under certain circumstances, to pay Gray a termination fee of $73 million;\n\u2022being required, under certain circumstances, to pay Gray a termination fee of $113 million;\n\u2022being required, under certain circumstances, to reimburse certain of Gray\u2019s expenses up to $10 million;\n\u2022having to pay substantial other costs and expenses relating to the proposed transaction, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor, filing, printing and mailing fees, and integration costs that have already been incurred and will continue to be incurred until closing;\n\u2022the focus of management of Meredith on the Merger instead of on pursuing other opportunities that could be beneficial to Meredith;\n\u2022the market price of Meredith could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed; and\n\u2022if the transaction agreement is terminated and Meredith\u2019s Board of Directors seeks another business combination, shareholder of Meredith cannot be certain that Meredith will be able to find a party willing to enter into a business combination or other strategic transaction on terms equivalent to or more attractive than the terms that Gray has agreed to in the Merger Agreement and Spin-Off Agreements;\nin each case, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of having the Merger and Spin-Off completed. In addition, if the Merger is not completed, Meredith may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from its customers and employees. Meredith could also be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Merger and Spin-Off or to enforcement proceedings commenced against Meredith to perform its obligations under the Merger Agreement and Spin-Off Agreements. If the Merger and Spin-Off are not completed, Meredith cannot assure its shareholders that these risks will not materialize and will not materially affect the business, financial results, and stock price of Meredith.\nThe existence of the pending Merger could have an adverse effect on our business, revenue, and results of operations. While the Merger is pending, advertisers and other sources of revenue may decide to delay, defer, or cancel purchases of our products and/or services, pending completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement. If these decisions represent a significant portion of our anticipated revenue, our results of operations and quarterly revenues could be substantially below the expectations of market analysts.\nIn addition, while the Merger is pending, we are subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our business, revenue, and results of operations, including:\n\u2022the diversion of management and employee attention and the unavoidable disruption to our relationships with customers and vendors may detract from our ability to grow revenues and minimize costs;\n\u2022the fact that we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses related to the Merger;\n\u2022the fact that, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we must generally conduct our business in the ordinary course and we are subject to a variety of other restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the closing or termination of the Merger Agreement; and\n\u2022the fact that we may be unable to respond effectively to competitive pressures, industry developments, and future opportunities.\nIf the Merger occurs, Meredith shareholders will not be able to participate in any upside to our local media business and NMG SpinCo, the company you will receive shares in through the Distribution, may not enjoy the same benefits that Meredith did prior to the Spin-Off. Upon consummation of the Merger, our shareholders will receive $16.99 in cash per share, without interest and subject to applicable tax withholding, for each share of Meredith common stock and Meredith class B stock owned by them, but will not receive any shares of Gray common stock. As a result, if our local media business performs well following the Merger, our current shareholders will not receive any additional consideration, and will therefore not receive any benefit from the performance of the business. In addition, if the Merger occurs, shareholders of Meredith as of the record date set for the Distribution will receive shares of common stock and class B common stock in NMG SpinCo on a one-for-one basis. Following the Spin-Off, our national media and digital businesses (which will comprise NMG SpinCo subsequent to the Spin-Off) will no longer operate as part of a larger Meredith that included the local media business. Accordingly, compared to Meredith prior to the Merger, NMG SpinCo will have less collateral to secure new financings, NMG SpinCo\u2019s business will be less diversified, NMG SpinCo\u2019s market capitalization will be smaller than that of Meredith, and NMG SpinCo\u2019s ability to take advantage of economies of scale may be adversely impacted. For example, NMG SpinCo may experience an adverse impact on pricing for goods and services. There is a risk that NMG SpinCo may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if it remained a part of the larger Meredith organizational structure.\nRisks Relating to Business Operations\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We have experienced challenges in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic including advertising cancellations and delays across our business as well as declines in our newsstand sales, resulting in an adverse impact on our revenues and results of operations. To protect the health and well-being of our employees, suppliers, and customers, we made substantial modifications to employee travel policies, implemented office closures as employees were advised to work from home, and canceled or shifted our marketing events to virtual-only.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our business operations, including our employees, customers, partners, and communities. There is substantial uncertainty as to the nature and degree of the continued effects of the pandemic over time. Our business, financial condition, operations, and prospects have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has adversely impacted our advertising and marketing partners, consumers, and the markets in which we operate.\nWhile the potential future impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business, in particular, may be difficult to assess or predict, to date the pandemic has resulted in and may continue to result in significant disruption of aspects of our business. For example, we have experienced advertising cancellations and delays across our business as well as declines in our newsstand sales, resulting in an adverse impact on our revenues. In addition, we may experience unfavorable impacts on our operations as a result of COVID-19, including but not limited to:\n\u2022significant reductions or volatility in demand for one or more of our products, which may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine, or other travel restrictions, or financial hardship, shifts in demand away from one or more of our products; if prolonged, such impacts may further increase the difficulty of planning for operations and may negatively impact our results;\n\u2022significant reductions in the availability of one or more of our products as a result of retailers or shippers modifying restocking, fulfillment, and shipping practices;\n\u2022failure of third parties on which we rely;\n\u2022continued increases in commodity costs;\n\u2022the inability of a significant portion of our workforce, including our management team, to work as a result of illness;\n\u2022shifts and volatility in consumer spending and purchasing behaviors; and\n\u2022reduced availability of credit or financing upon acceptable terms or at all.\nAs a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have paused our common and class B stock dividends and implemented a series of operational cost-control measures, including temporary reductions in Board of Director fees and employee and executive salaries which were lifted in early September 2020, and have taken steps to significantly reduce capital expenditures and optimize working capital. We may need to take further actions to ensure the continuity of our business. In addition, due to market volatility and material declines in equity prices, in fiscal 2020, we recorded material non-cash impairment charges related to certain indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, trademarks, and FCC broadcast licenses.\nThe duration and extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus, the emergence and spread of variants, infection rates in areas where we operate, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, including the continued availability and effectiveness of vaccines in the markets where we operate, and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, suppliers, distributors, and manufacturers. Should these conditions persist for a prolonged period, the COVID-19 pandemic, including any of the above factors and others that are currently unknown, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The pandemic may also affect our business, operations, or financial condition in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Item 1A, Risk Factors, any of which could have a material effect on us.\nAdvertising related revenues represent the largest portion of our revenues, and advertising demand may fluctuate from period to period. In fiscal 2021, 51 percent of our revenues were derived from advertising related sources. Advertising related revenues constitute 48 percent of our national media revenues and 59 percent of our local media revenues. Demand for advertising is highly dependent upon the strength of the U.S. economy. During an economic downturn, demand for advertising may decrease. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, some of our advertising and marketing partners have faced tremendous challenges, which has impacted Meredith. As a result, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, Meredith saw cancellations and delays in advertising campaigns, with significant declines in local television non-political advertising, digital advertising, and print advertising revenues. While digital advertising strengthened in fiscal 2021, we continued to see an adverse impact on print and local television non-political advertising into fiscal 2021. While we are not able to estimate the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on revenues, we may continue to see an adverse impact on print advertising and do not know when or if it will improve. In addition, political advertising revenues are cyclical in that they are significantly\ngreater during biennial election campaigns (which take place primarily in odd-numbered fiscal years) than at other times. The growth in alternative forms of media, particularly digital platforms, has increased the competition for advertising dollars, which could, in turn, reduce expenditures for magazine and television advertising or suppress advertising rates.\nCirculation revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues. Magazine circulation is another significant source of revenue, representing 24 percent of total revenues and 35 percent of national media revenues in fiscal 2021. Preserving the number of copies sold is critical for maintaining advertising sales. Magazines face increasing competition from alternative forms of media and entertainment. As a result, sales of magazines through subscriptions and at the newsstand could decline. As publishers compete for subscribers, subscription prices could decrease and marketing expenditures may increase. Shelter-in-place and business closing orders related to COVID-19 as well as significant declines in travel impacted Meredith particularly in the first half of fiscal 2021. As a result, Meredith saw reductions in newsstand sales. While the Company is not able to estimate the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on newsstand revenues, we may experience further declines in newsstand sales.\nTechnology in the media industry continues to evolve rapidly. Advances in technology have led to an increasing number of alternative methods for the delivery of content and have driven consumer demand and expectations in unanticipated directions. If we are unable to exploit new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors or adapt to new distribution methods that provide optimal user experiences, our business, financial condition, and prospects may be adversely affected. Technology developments also pose other challenges that could adversely affect our revenues and competitive position. New delivery platforms may lead to pricing restrictions, the loss of distribution control, and the loss of a direct relationship with consumers. For example, the largest broadcast television national networks have brought a copyright infringement lawsuit against Locast, an entity that claims to be a non-profit and claims to have found a loophole allowing for uncompensated online streaming of copyrighted television content. We may also be adversely affected if the use of technology developed to block the display of advertising on websites proliferates. In addition, technologies such as subscription streaming media services and video are increasing competition for household audiences and advertisers. This competition may make it difficult for us to grow or maintain our broadcasting and print revenues, which we believe may challenge us to expand the contribution of our digital businesses.\nOur websites and internal networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized persons accessing our systems, which could disrupt our operations. The Company uses computers and other technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations, and our revenues are increasingly dependent on digital products. Such increases expose us to potential cyber incidents resulting from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Our website activities involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information, which we strive to protect from unauthorized access. However, it is possible that unauthorized persons may be able to circumvent our protections and misappropriate proprietary information, corrupt data, or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our digital operations. The results of these incidents could include, but are not limited to, business interruption, public disclosure of nonpublic information, decreased advertising revenues, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation, financial consequences, and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence, any or all of which could adversely affect our business. We invest in security resources and technology to protect our data and business processes against risk of data security breaches and cyber-attack, but the techniques used to attempt attacks are continually changing. A breach or successful attack could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation.\nEvolving privacy and information security laws and regulations may impair our ability to market to consumers. Meredith\u2019s consumer database includes first-party data that is used to market our products to our customers. In select circumstances, we share this first-party data with advertising and marketing clients and partners. As public awareness increases and shifts to data gathering and usage, privacy rights, and data protection, new laws and regulations may be passed or existing laws and regulations may be amended in ways that would limit our collection and use of certain categories of data. The United States Congress, the Federal Trade Commission, and state attorneys general continue to initiate investigations into the collection and use of consumer data, often with a focus on the advertising industry. These investigations could lead to new transparency requirements, consumer\ncontrols, and other restrictions, and require ongoing review of new technologies and methods for delivering content and advertising to ensure that all new products and advertising services comply with all of the regulatory requirements imposed at the state, federal, and international level. In addition to the changing regulatory landscape, new privacy controls implemented by platforms such as Facebook, Google, and Apple will limit our ability to access and use data from consumers through those platforms, which we rely on for digital advertising and marketing.\nCurrently, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous, and sometimes conflicting, regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere. For example, the European Union (E.U.) adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR), which became effective on May 25, 2018; and California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (the CCPA), which became effective on January 1, 2020. These laws impose additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provide certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is processed.\nThe GDPR establishes requirements applicable to the processing of personal data, affords new data protection rights to individuals (e.g., the right to erasure of personal data), and imposes penalties for serious data breaches. Individuals also have a right to compensation under GDPR for financial or non-financial losses. Additionally, Brexit took effect in January 2020, which will lead to further legislative and regulatory changes. While the Data Protection Act of 2018, that \u201cimplements\u201d and complements the GDPR achieved Royal Assent on May 23, 2018, and is now effective in the United Kingdom (U.K.), it is still unclear whether transfer of data from the European Economic Area (EEA) to the U.K. will remain lawful in the long term under GDPR. With the expiry of the transition period on December 31, 2020, companies will have to comply with the GDPR and the GDPR as incorporated into U.K. national law, which has the ability to separately fine up to the greater of \u00a317.5 million or 4 percent of global turnover.\nIf we do not comply with our obligations under the GDPR, we could be exposed to fines and penalties, which under the GDPR could be as high as the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4 percent of our total global annual revenue in the event of a significant breach. In addition, we may be the subject of litigation or adverse publicity, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Similarly, the CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation.\nAdditionally, legal challenges in Europe to the mechanisms allowing companies to transfer personal data from the EEA to the U.S. could result in further limitations on the ability to transfer personal data across borders, particularly if governments are unable or unwilling to reach new or maintain existing agreements that support cross-border data transfers. Specifically, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the E.U. invalidated Decision 2016/1250 on the adequacy of the protection provided by the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. We are certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework but will not be able to rely on it in the future, which could increase our costs and limit our ability to process personal data from the E.U. The same decision also casts doubt on the ability to use one of the primary alternatives to the Privacy Shield, namely, the European Commission\u2019s Standard Contractual Clauses, to lawfully transfer personal data from Europe to the U.S. and most other countries. At present, there are few, if any, viable alternatives to the Privacy Shield and the Standard Contractual Clauses. On June 28, 2021, the European Commission announced a decision of \u201cadequacy\u201d concluding that the U.K. ensures an equivalent level of data protection to the GDPR, which provides some relief regarding the legality of continued personal data flows from the EEA to the U.K. Some uncertainty remains, however, as this adequacy determination must be renewed after four years and may be modified or revoked in the interim. We cannot fully predict how the Data Protection Act, the U.K. GDPR, and other U.K. data protection laws or regulations may develop in the medium to longer term nor the effects of divergent laws and guidance regarding how data transfers to and from the U.K. will be regulated.\nIn the U.S., California voters approved a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) in the November 3, 2020 election. Effective starting on January 1, 2023, the CPRA will significantly modify the CCPA, including by expanding consumers\u2019 rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information. The CPRA also creates a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. New legislation proposed or enacted in various other states will continue to shape the data privacy environment\nnationally beyond the CCPA and CPRA. For example, on March 2, 2021, Virginia enacted the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, or CDPA, which becomes effective on January 1, 2023, and on June 8, 2021, Colorado enacted the Colorado Privacy Act, or CPA, which takes effect on July 1, 2023. The CPA and CDPA are similar to the CCPA and CPRA, but aspects of these state privacy statutes remain unclear, resulting in further legal uncertainty and potentially requiring us to modify our data practices and policies and to incur substantial additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Complying with the GDPR, CCPA, CPRA, CDPA, CPA, or other laws, regulations, amendments to, or re-interpretations of existing laws and regulations, and contractual or other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, data transfers, data localization, or information security may require us to make changes to our services to enable us or our customers to meet new legal requirements, incur substantial operational costs, modify our data practices and policies, and restrict our business operations. Any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with these laws, regulations, or other obligations may lead to significant fines, penalties, regulatory investigations, lawsuits, significant costs for remediation, damage to our reputation, or other liabilities.\nCompliance with existing, proposed, and recently enacted laws (including implementation of the privacy and process enhancements called for under GDPR and CCPA) and regulations can be costly and time consuming, and any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks. In addition, all 50 states have security breach notification laws that generally require a business to give notice to consumers and (in some cases) government agencies when certain information has been accessed or acquired by an unauthorized party due to a security breach.\nMisuse of or failure to secure personal information could result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others, imposition of fines by governmental authorities, and damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits.\nWorld events may result in unexpected adverse operating results. Our results have been and in the future could again be affected adversely by world events such as wars, political unrest, acts of terrorism, pandemics, and natural disasters, as well as by adverse economic conditions such as prolonged economic downturn, lack of liquidity in the capital markets, or increased inflation. In particular, such events can result in significant declines in advertising revenues in our local media segment as the stations will not broadcast or will limit broadcasting of commercials during times of crisis. In addition, our stations may have higher newsgathering costs related to coverage of the events.\nOur local media operations are subject to FCC regulation. Our broadcasting stations operate under licenses granted by the FCC. The FCC regulates many aspects of television station operations, including employment practices, political advertising, indecency and obscenity, programming, signal carriage, and various other technical matters. Violations of these regulations could result in penalties and fines. Changes in these regulations could impact the results of our operations. The FCC also regulates the ownership of television stations. Changes in the ownership rules could adversely affect our ability to consummate future transactions or may favor our competitors. Details regarding regulation and its impact on our local media operations are provided in Item 1 - Business beginning on page 10.\nLoss of or changes in affiliation agreements could adversely affect operating results for our local media segment. Further, our retransmission consent revenue may be adversely affected by renewals of retransmission consent agreements or by declines in the number of subscribers to multichannel video programming distributor (MVPD) services. Due to the quality of the programming provided by the networks, stations that are affiliated with a network generally have higher ratings than unaffiliated independent stations in the same market. As a result, it is important for stations to maintain their network affiliations. Most of our stations have network affiliation agreements. Seven are affiliated with CBS, five with FOX, two with MyNetworkTV, one with NBC, and one with ABC. These television networks produce and distribute programming in exchange for each of our stations\u2019 commitment to air the programming at specified times and for commercial announcement time during the programming. We also make cash payments to the networks. These payments are, in essence, a portion of the retransmission consent fees that Meredith receives from cable, satellite, and telecommunications service providers,\nwhich pay Meredith to carry our television programming in our markets. These network relationships may also include terms regarding over-the-top distribution. The non-renewal or termination of any of our network affiliation agreements would prevent us from being able to carry programming of the affiliate network. This loss of programming would require us to obtain replacement programming, which may involve higher costs and/or which may not be as attractive to our audiences, resulting in reduced revenues.\nFurthermore, the loss of or material reduction in retransmission consent revenues or further change in the current retransmission consent regulations could adversely affect the economics of our relationship with the applicable network(s), advertising revenues, and our local brands. Specifically, our retransmission consent revenue may be adversely affected by renewals, non-renewals, or renewals on less favorable terms of retransmission consent agreements, declines in the number of subscribers to MVPD services, or by new technologies for the distribution of video programming. In recent years, the number of subscribers to MVPD services has declined as the growth of direct internet streaming of video programming to televisions and mobile devices has led consumers to discontinue their cable or satellite service subscriptions. As most retransmission consent agreements include payment terms by subscriber numbers, reductions in the number of MVPD subscribers reduces the revenue we earn under our retransmission agreements.\nIf renewed, our network affiliation agreements and our retransmission agreements may be renewed on terms that are less favorable to us. Our FOX affiliation agreements expire in July 2022. Our MyNetworkTV affiliation agreements expire in September 2022. Our NBC affiliation agreement expires in December 2021 and our ABC affiliation agreement expires in August 2023. Our CBS affiliation agreements expire in July 2023.\nClient relationships are important to our brand licensing and consumer relationship marketing businesses. Our ability to maintain existing client relationships and generate new clients depends significantly on the quality of our products and services, our reputation, and the continuity of Company and client personnel. Dissatisfaction with our products and services, damage to our reputation, or changes in key personnel could result in a loss of business.\nIncreases in paper and postage prices, which are difficult to predict and control, could adversely affect our results of operations. Paper and postage represent significant components of our total cost to produce, distribute, and market our printed products. In fiscal 2021, these expenses accounted for 17 percent of national media\u2019s operating costs. Paper is a commodity and its price can be subject to significant volatility. All our paper supply contracts currently provide for price adjustments based on prevailing market prices; however, we historically have been able to realize favorable paper pricing through volume discounts. The USPS distributes substantially all our subscription magazines and many of our marketing materials. Postal rates are dependent on the operating efficiency of the USPS and on legislative mandates imposed upon the USPS. Although we work with others in the industry and through trade organizations to encourage the USPS to implement efficiencies that will minimize rate increases, we cannot predict with certainty the magnitude of future price changes for paper and postage. Further, we may not be able to pass such increases on to our customers.\nWe are currently reliant on a single supplier for printing of our magazines. All our magazine printing is performed by the only domestic supplier capable of producing the entirety of our work. Failure by such supplier to provide printing services to us, or any disruption in such services, may adversely impact our business. We may incur increased business disruption risk due to the dependence on a single supplier. If this supplier experienced business difficulties or failed to meet our printing needs, then we may be unable to satisfy customer product demands, lose revenues, and be unable to maintain customer relationships. Longer production lead times and increased paper and postage costs may result if there is a need to move the printing to multiple other suppliers. Without such single supplier continuing to print our magazines, we may have no other means of producing our magazines until we are able to secure printing capabilities at multiple other facilities. This transition could be costly and time consuming.\nAcquisitions pose inherent financial and other risks and challenges. As a part of our strategic plan, we have acquired businesses and we expect to continue acquiring businesses in the future. These acquisitions can involve a number of risks and challenges, any of which could cause significant operating inefficiencies and adversely affect\nour growth and profitability. Such risks and challenges include underperformance relative to our expectations and the price paid for the acquisition; unanticipated demands on our management and operational resources; difficulty in integrating personnel, operations, and systems; retention of customers of the combined businesses; assumption of contingent liabilities; and acquisition-related earnings charges. If our acquisitions are not successful, we may record impairment charges. Our ability to continue to make acquisitions will depend upon our success at identifying suitable targets, which requires substantial judgment in assessing their values, strengths, weaknesses, liabilities, and potential profitability, as well as the availability of suitable candidates at acceptable prices and whether restrictions are imposed by regulations. Moreover, competition for certain types of acquisitions is significant, particularly in the fields of broadcast stations and digital media. Even if successfully negotiated, closed, and integrated, certain acquisitions may not advance our business strategy and may fall short of expected return on investment targets.\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets is possible, depending upon future operating results and the value of the Company\u2019s stock. Although the Company wrote down its goodwill and intangible assets by $301.4 million in fiscal 2020 and $41.8 million in fiscal 2019, further impairment charges are possible. We test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of every fiscal year and on an interim basis if indicators of impairment exist. Factors that influence the evaluation include, among many things, the Company\u2019s stock price and expected future operating results. If the carrying value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset is no longer deemed to be recoverable, a potentially material non-cash impairment charge could be incurred. At June 30, 2021, goodwill and intangible assets totaled $3.3 billion, or 59 percent of Meredith\u2019s total assets, with $2.5 billion in the national media segment and $0.8 billion in the local media segment. The review of goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level. The Company has two reporting units - national media and local media. Changes in key assumptions about the economy or business prospects used to estimate fair value or other changes in market conditions could result in additional impairment charges. Although these charges would be non-cash in nature and would not affect the Company\u2019s operations or cash flow, they would reduce stockholders\u2019 equity and reported results of operations in the period charged. Additionally, as goodwill and intangible assets of the national media reporting unit were written down to their estimated fair values as of March 31, 2020, those amounts are more susceptible to risk of impairment if business operating results or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows. Maintaining effective disclosure controls and procedures and effective internal control over financial reporting are necessary for us to produce reliable consolidated financial statements. The Company cannot provide assurances that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not occur in the future and that it will be able to remediate such weaknesses or deficiencies in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows. The development of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our reporting and financial obligations, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the trading price of our common stock, and/or result in litigation against us. In addition, those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or facilitate the fair presentation of our consolidated financial statements or our periodic reports filed with the SEC.\nAdverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we are currently and, in the future, may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit our ability to operate our business. We are currently involved in and may in the future become involved in private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legal proceedings by clients, employees, suppliers, competitors, government agencies, or others. For example, on September 6, 2019, a shareholder filed a putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company, its Chief Executive Officer, and its Chief Financial Officer, seeking to represent a class of shareholders who acquired securities of the Company between May 10, 2018, and September 4, 2019 (the New York Action). On September 12, 2019, a shareholder filed a putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa against the Company, its Chief Executive Officer, its Chief Financial Officer, and its Chairman of the Board seeking to represent a class of shareholders who acquired securities of the Company between January 31, 2018, and September 5, 2019 (the Iowa\nAction). Both complaints allege that the defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company\u2019s business, operations, and prospects. Both complaints assert claims under the federal securities laws and seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief. On November 12, 2019, the plaintiff shareholder withdrew the New York Action, and the action has been dismissed. On November 25, 2019, the City of Plantation Police Officers Pension Fund was appointed to serve as lead plaintiff in the Iowa Action. On March 9, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint in the Iowa Action, now seeking to represent a class of shareholders who acquired securities of the Company between January 31, 2018, and September 30, 2019. The defendants intend to vigorously oppose the Iowa Action. On June 22, 2020, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Iowa Action. On October 28, 2020, a U.S. District Judge granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, dismissing the Iowa Action with prejudice at plaintiffs\u2019 cost due to plaintiffs\u2019 failure to satisfy applicable pleading requirements. Specifically, the court held that plaintiffs had failed to plead any actionable misstatement or omission, scienter, or loss causation. On November 23, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed a notice of appeal of the District Court\u2019s dismissal. The parties have completed briefing in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, and it appears likely we will receive a decision on the appeal sometime in late 2021 or 2022. The results of any such litigation, including the aforementioned class action lawsuits, investigations, and other legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, damage our reputation, require significant amounts of management time, and divert significant resources. If any of these legal proceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or limits on our ability to operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have two classes of stock outstanding with different voting rights. We have two classes of stock outstanding: common stock and class B stock. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share and account for 45 percent of the voting power. Holders of class B stock are entitled to ten votes per share and account for the remaining 55 percent of the voting power. There are restrictions on who can own class B stock. Members of Meredith\u2019s founding family hold the majority of class B shares. Control by a limited number of holders may make the Company a less attractive takeover target, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. This voting control also prevents other shareholders from exercising significant influence over certain of the Company\u2019s business decisions.\nAdverse changes in the equity markets or interest rates, changes in actuarial assumptions, and legislative or other regulatory actions could substantially increase our U.K. pension costs and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The Company sponsors the IPC Media Pension Scheme (the IPC Plan), a U.K. defined benefit pension plan that is closed both to new participants and to the future accrual of additional benefits for current participants. The majority of pensions in payment and deferred pensions in excess of any guaranteed minimum pension are increased annually in line with the increase in the retail price index up to a maximum of 5 percent.\nThe most recent triennial valuation of the IPC Plan under U.K. pension regulations was completed as of April 5, 2018. Under the assumptions used in such valuation, which are more conservative than the assumptions used to determine a pension plan\u2019s funded status in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP), the IPC Plan was deemed to be underfunded at that time by approximately \u00a359 million.\nUnder the current deed of guarantee, the Company would be obligated to fund the IPC Plan\u2019s \u201cbuyout deficit\u201d (i.e., the amount that would be needed to purchase annuities to discharge the benefits under the plan) under certain circumstances. Specifically, the Company would be required to deposit the buyout deficit into escrow if its debt in excess of $50 million were not to be paid when due or were to come due prior to its stated maturity as a result of a default (a Major Debt Acceleration) or if a Covenant Breach were to occur (as described below). The Company would be permitted to recoup the escrowed funds under certain circumstances. However, if the Company, as the sponsor, was to become insolvent, or if a Major Debt Acceleration were to occur (without being promptly cured), any escrowed funds would be immediately contributed into the IPC Plan, and the Company would be obligated to immediately contribute into the IPC Plan any shortfall in the buyout deficit amount.\nIn connection with the completion of the sale of all issued shares of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd (TIUK) on March 15, 2018, and the substitution of another U.K. subsidiary of the Company as the sole sponsor under the IPC Plan, the deed of guarantee was amended to remove requirements to deposit the buyout deficit as a result of certain credit rating triggers. At the same time, the Company agreed that the same subsidiaries of the Company that guarantee the Company\u2019s initial $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.875 percent unsecured senior notes (2026 Unsecured Senior Notes) would guarantee the obligations of the Company under the IPC Plan on a pari passu basis with the obligations under the 2026 Unsecured Senior Notes. In addition, the Company agreed to incorporate the terms of certain covenants under the indenture governing the 2026 Unsecured Senior Notes into the amended deed of guarantee effective as of March 15, 2018. If a breach of such covenants by the Company or the subsidiary guarantors occurs (after certain notice and cure periods) (a Covenant Breach), the Company would be required to deposit the buyout deficit (less the amount of certain types of security in favor of the IPC Plan, currently provided in the form of a surety bond) into escrow as described above.\nIf the Company had been required to fund the buyout deficit on June 30, 2021, the amount would have been approximately \u00a377 million. The amount of the buyout deficit changes daily and is determined by many factors, including changes in the fair value of the IPC Plan assets and liabilities and interest rates.\nIt is possible that, following future valuations of the IPC Plan\u2019s assets and liabilities or following future discussions with the IPC Plan trustee, the annual funding obligation and/or the arrangements to ensure adequate funding for the IPC Plan will change. The future valuations under the IPC Plan can be affected by a number of assumptions and factors, including legislative changes; assumptions regarding interest rates, currency rates, inflation, mortality, and retirement rates; the investment strategy and performance of the IPC Plan assets; and (in certain limited circumstances) actions by the U.K. Pensions Regulator. Volatile economic conditions could increase the risk that the funding requirements increase following the next triennial valuation. The U.K. Pensions Regulator also has powers under the Pensions Act 2004 to impose a contribution notice or a financial support direction on the Company (and other persons connected with the Company or the U.K. subsidiary which sponsors the IPC Plan) if, in the case of a contribution notice, the U.K. Pensions Regulator reasonably believes such person has been party to an act, or deliberate failure to act, intended to avoid pension liabilities or that is materially detrimental to the pension plan, or, in the case of a financial support direction, if a plan employer is a service company or insufficiently resourced and the Pensions Regulator considers it is reasonable to act against such a person. A significant increase in the funding requirements for the IPC Plan or in the calculated \u201cself-sufficiency deficit\u201d or the calculated \u201crisk-free self-sufficiency deficit\u201d could result in a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Indebtedness\nOur level of indebtedness and our ability to incur significant additional indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate requirements or to carry out other aspects of our business;\n\u2022increase our cost of borrowing;\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate requirements or to carry out other aspects of our business;\n\u2022limit our ability to make material acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities that may arise;\n\u2022expose us to fluctuations in interest rates, to the extent our borrowings bear variable rates of interest;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022limit our ability to pay dividends;\n\u2022place us at a potential disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022affect our credit ratings.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on and be subject to our future financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general economic, financial, competitive, business, and other factors beyond our control, including the availability of financing in the banking and capital markets. Our business may fail to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or borrow funds in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments on our debt, to refinance our debt, or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we were unable to make payments on or refinance our debt or obtain new financing under these circumstances, we would have to consider other options, such as asset sales, equity issuances, or negotiations with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt. The terms of our debt agreements and market or business conditions may limit our ability to take some or all of these actions. In addition, if we incur additional debt, the related risks described above could be exacerbated.\nOur indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly or could prevent us from taking advantage of lower rates. A portion of our indebtedness consists of term loans and revolving credit facility borrowings with variable rates of interest that expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net earnings and cash flows will correspondingly decrease. Even if we enter into interest rate swaps in the future to reduce future interest rate volatility, we may not elect to maintain such interest rate swaps with respect to any of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. In addition, we have significant fixed-rate indebtedness that includes prepayment penalties, which could prevent us from taking advantage of any future decrease in interest rates that may otherwise be applicable to us.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. Our ability to make cash payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate significant operating cash flow in the future. Our ability to generate such cash flow is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control.\nOur business may not generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, selling assets, issuing equity, or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, and investments. These actions, if necessary, may not be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to refinance or restructure our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at the applicable time. Any refinancing of our debt, if we are able to refinance our debt at all, could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. Further, the credit agreement that governs the senior credit facilities, the indenture governing our initial $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.500 percent secured senior notes (2025 Secured Senior Notes), and the indenture governing the 2026 Unsecured Senior Notes (collectively the Senior Notes) restricts our ability to undertake, or use the proceeds from, such measures.\nOur ability to repay our indebtedness is largely dependent on the generation of cash flow by our operating subsidiaries and our operating subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make cash available to us by dividend, intercompany loans, advances, and other transactions, or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to transfer cash to us to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries, may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries.\nCovenants under the indentures governing our Senior Notes and our credit agreement may restrict our business and operations in many ways, and if we do not effectively manage our covenants, our financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected. The indentures governing our Senior Notes and\nour credit agreement impose various covenants that limit our ability and/or our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022pay dividends or distributions, repurchase equity, prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt, and make certain investments;\n\u2022incur additional debt and issue certain preferred stock;\n\u2022provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons;\n\u2022incur liens on assets;\n\u2022engage in certain asset sales, including capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022merge, consolidate with, or sell all or substantially all our assets to another person;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022enter into agreements that restrict distributions from our subsidiaries;\n\u2022designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and\n\u2022prohibit certain restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us.\nThese covenants may:\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general business purposes;\n\u2022limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general business purposes;\n\u2022require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;\n\u2022limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the limitations and decreased flexibility on our business due to our significant debt obligations, we may not be able to capitalize on strategic opportunities or grow our business to the extent we would be able to without these limitations.\nOur failure to comply with any of the covenants could result in a default under the credit agreement or the indentures governing the Senior Notes, which could permit the administrative agent or the trustee, as applicable, or permit the lenders or the holders of the Senior Notes to cause the administrative agent or the trustee, as applicable, to declare all or part of any of our outstanding senior secured term loans or revolving loans or the Senior Notes to be immediately due and payable or to exercise any remedies provided to the administrative agent or the trustee, including, in the case of the credit agreement and the 2025 Secured Senior Notes, proceeding against the collateral granted to secure our obligations under the credit agreement and the 2025 Secured Senior Notes. An event of default under the credit agreement or the indentures governing the Senior Notes could also lead to an event of default under the terms of certain of our other agreements. Any such event of default or any exercise of rights and remedies by our creditors could seriously harm our business.\nDiscontinuation, reform, or replacement of LIBOR may adversely affect our variable rate debt. A substantial portion of our long-term indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate for deposits of U.S dollars (LIBOR). LIBOR tends to fluctuate based on general interest rates, rates set by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and other central banks, the supply of and demand for credit in the London interbank market, and general economic conditions. In July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve Board, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index, calculated with a broad set of short-term repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms, or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the U.S. or elsewhere. To the extent\nthese interest rates increase, our interest expense will increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Income Taxes\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities. Our Company is subject to income taxes as well as non-income taxes, in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant uncertainties exist with respect to the amount of our tax liabilities, including those arising from potential changes in laws in the countries in which we have a presence and the possibility of adverse determinations with respect to the application of existing laws. Many judgments are required in determining our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by tax authorities, which often do not agree with positions taken by us on our tax returns. Any unfavorable resolution of these uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate.\nIncreasingly, countries around the world are actively considering or have enacted changes in relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, and interpretations. In particular, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act) significantly changed how corporations are taxed in the U.S., which has an ongoing impact on our provision for income taxes. While the Company\u2019s accounting for the effects of the Tax Act was completed in fiscal 2019, and the Company believes those effects have been appropriately recorded, various interpretive issues remain with respect to the Tax Act and additional regulatory guidance may be issued. Certain aspects of the Tax Act have been modified by subsequent legislation, such as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act).\nThe uncertainty in the application of the Tax Act and the CARES Act to our ongoing operations, potential future increases in capital gains tax rates, as well as possible adverse future law changes attributable to changes in the U.S. political landscape, create the potential for added volatility in our quarterly provision for income taxes and could have an adverse impact on our future tax rate. Various legislative proposals would partially or wholly reverse beneficial features of the Tax Act, such as by raising the U.S. corporate tax rate and increasing the tax on non-U.S. income. Increased federal and state fiscal spending to fund COVID-19 relief measures, coupled with a drop in tax revenue from pandemic-related reductions in economic activity, may add to the pressure to raise more tax revenue from federal and state corporate income and other taxes or to enact new types of taxes on businesses and their customers.\nThe Time business could have an indemnification obligation to Time Warner, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition. The complete legal and structural separation of Time Warner Inc.\u2019s (Time Warner) magazine publishing and related business from Time Warner (the Time Spin-Off) was completed by way of a pro rata dividend of Time Inc. shares held by Time Warner to its stockholders as of May 23, 2014, based on a distribution ratio of one share of Time Inc. common stock for every eight shares of Time Warner common stock held (the Distribution). If, due to any of Time Inc.\u2019s representations being untrue or Time Inc.\u2019s covenants being breached, it was determined that the Distribution did not qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code, or that an excess loss account existed at the date of the Time Spin-Off, Time Inc. could be required to indemnify Time Warner for the resulting taxes and related expenses. Any such indemnification obligation could materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe preceding risk factors should not be construed as a complete list of factors that\nmay affect our future operations and financial results.", "PERMNO": 42796, "SIC": 2721, "TIC": "MDP"}
