{"cik": "1372183", "company": "Next 1 Interactive, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-06-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, readers should carefully consider the following important factors. These factors, among others, in some cases have affected, and in the future could affect, our financial condition and results of operations and could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements that appear in this Form 10-K or that we have made or will make elsewhere.\nRisks Inherent to this Company\nBecause of losses incurred by us to date and our general financial condition, we received a going concern qualification in the audit report from our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for the most recent fiscal year that raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue to operate as a going concern.\nAt February 28, 2015, we had $226,412 cash on hand. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $86,078,617 and a working capital deficit of $12,811,302 at February 28, 2015, net loss for the year ended February 28, 2015 of $50,486 and cash used in operations during the year ended February 28, 2015 of $2,624,822. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe anticipate that we will have operating losses in the foreseeable future.\nWe cannot assure you that we will ever achieve profitable operations or generate significant revenues. Our future operating results depend on many factors, including demand for our products, the level of competition, and the ability of our officers to manage our business and growth. As a result of the emerging nature of the market in which we compete, we anticipate that we will have operating losses until such time as we can develop a substantial and stable revenue base.\nWe will need additional capital which may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe have very limited financial resources. We currently have a monthly cash requirement of approximately $200,000, exclusive of capital expenditures. We will need to raise substantial additional capital to support the on-going operation and increased market penetration of our products including the development of national advertising relationships, increases in operating costs resulting from additional staff and office space until such time as we generate revenues sufficient to support itself. We believe that in the aggregate, we will need as much as approximately $1 million to $3 million to support and expand the marketing and development of our travel, employment, and Home & Away Club products, repay debt obligations, provide capital expenditures for additional equipment, payment obligations under charter affiliation agreements, office space and systems for managing the business, and cover other operating costs until our planned revenue streams from media advertising and e-commerce, travel, employment, Home & Away Club products are fully-implemented and begin to offset our operating costs. Our failure to obtain additional capital to finance our working capital needs on acceptable terms, or at all, will negatively impact our business, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, as of February 28, 2015, we had approximately $13.1 million of current liabilities. We currently do not have the resources to satisfy these obligations, some of which are in default, and our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business and ability to continue as a going concern.\nIf we continue to experience liquidity issues and are unable to generate revenue, we may be unable to repay our outstanding debt when due and may be forced to seek protection under the federal bankruptcy laws.\nWe have experienced liquidity issues since our inception due to, among other reasons, our limited ability to raise adequate capital on acceptable terms. We have historically relied upon the issuance of promissory notes that are convertible into shares of our common stock to fund our operations and currently anticipate that we will need to continue to issue promissory notes, or equity, to fund our operations and repay our outstanding debt for the foreseeable future. At February 28, 2015, we had $9.3 million of current debt outstanding. If we are unable to achieve operational profitability or not successful in issuing additional promissory notes or securing other forms of financing, we will have to evaluate alternative actions to reduce our operating expenses and conserve cash.\nMoreover, as a result of our liquidity issues, we have experienced delays in the repayment of promissory notes upon maturity and the payment of trade receivables to vendors and others when due. Our failure to pay vendors and others may continue to result in litigation, as well as interest and late charges, which will increase our cost of operations. If in the future, holders of promissory notes demand repayment of principal and accrued interest instead of electing to convert to common stock and we are unable to repay our debt when due or resolve issues with existing promissory note holders, we may be forced to refinance these notes on terms less favorable to us than the existing notes.\nOur business revenue generation model is unproven and could fail.\nOur revenue model is new and evolving, and we cannot be certain that it will be successful. The potential profitability of this business model is unproven and there can be no assurance that we can achieve profitable operations. Our ability to generate revenues depends, among other things, on our ability to operate our television network and operate our video on demand business and create enough viewership to provide advertisers, sponsors, travelers and home buyers value. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our business model will be successful or that we can sustain revenue growth, or achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur success is dependent upon our senior management team and our ability to hire and retain qualified employees.\nOur success materially depends upon the efforts of our management and other key personnel, including but not limited to William Kerby, our Chief Executive Officer, and Adam Friedman, our Chief Financial Officer. If we lose the services of either of these members of management, our business would be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, we do not have \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance, and we do not presently intend to purchase such insurance.\nWe believe that our success is substantially dependent upon: (1) our ability to retain and motivate our senior management team and other key employees; and (2) our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate other qualified personnel. The development of our business and operations is dependent upon the efforts and talents of our executive officers, whose extensive experience and contacts within the industries in which we wish to compete are a critical component of our business strategy. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in retaining the services of any of the members of our senior management team or other key personnel, or in hiring qualified technical, managerial, marketing and administrative personnel. If we do not succeed in retaining our employees and in attracting new employees, our business could suffer significantly.\nWe may be unable to implement our business and growth strategy.\nOur growth strategy and ability to generate revenues and profits is dependent upon our ability to: (1) develop and provide new services and products; (2) establish and maintain sales and distribution channels, including the on-going operation and expansion of our television network; (3) develop new business opportunities; (4) maintain our existing clients and continue to develop the organization and systems to support these clients; (5) establish financial and management systems; (6) attract, retain and hire highly skilled management and consultants; (7) obtain adequate financing on acceptable terms to fund our growth strategy; (8) develop and expand our client and customer bases; and (9) negotiate agreements on terms that will permit us to generate adequate profit margins. Our failure with respect to any or all of these factors could impair our ability to successfully implement our growth strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe intend to launch new products in a volatile market and we may be unsuccessful.\nWe intend to launch new products, which include a television network and VOD for real estate and travel related products. The media, travel and real estate sectors are volatile marketplaces and we may not be able to successfully penetrate and develop all or either of them. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the airwave space necessary to carry a new television network. We will be successful only if consumers establish a loyalty to our network and purchase the products and services advertised on the network. We will have no control over consumer reaction to our network or product offerings. If we are not successful in building a strong and loyal consumer following, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability.\nWe do not have the ability to control the volatility of sales.\nOur business is dependent on selling our products in a volatile consumer-oriented marketplace. The retail consumer industry, by its nature, is very volatile and sensitive to numerous economic factors, including competition, market conditions and general economic conditions. None of these conditions are within our control. There can be no assurance that we will have stable or growing sales of our products and advertising space on our television network, and maintain profitability in the volatile consumer marketplace.\nWe may not be able to purchase and/or license assets that are critical to our business.\nWe intend to purchase and/or license archived video and travel collection libraries to fulfill the programming needs of the Network. The acquisition or licensure of these assets is critical to accomplishing our business plan. We cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining these assets or that if we do acquire them, that we will be able to do so at a reasonable cost. Our failure to purchase and/or license these libraries at a reasonable cost would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe enter into carriage/distribution agreements with companies that will broadcast our products. If we do not maintain good working relationships with these companies, or perform as required under these agreements, it could adversely affect our business.\nThe carriage/distribution agreements establish complex relationships between these companies and us. We intend to spend a significant amount of time, effort and cost to maintain our relationships with these companies and address the issues that from time to time may arise from these complex relationships. These companies could decide not to renew their agreements at the end of their respective terms. Additionally, if we do not perform as required under these agreements or if we breach these agreements, these companies could seek to terminate their agreements prior to the end of their respective terms or seek damages from us. Loss of these existing carriage/distribution agreements would adversely affect our ability to continue to operate our network as well as our ability to fully implement our business plan.\nAdditionally, the companies that we have carriage/distribution agreements with are subject to FCC jurisdiction under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. FCC rules, among other things, govern the term, renewal and transfer of radio and television broadcasting licenses and limit concentrations of broadcasting control inconsistent with the public interest. If these companies do not maintain their radio and television broadcasting licenses, our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe rely on third parties for key aspects of the process of providing services to our customers, and any failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties could harm our ability to operate our business and damage our reputation.\nWe rely on third-party vendors, including website providers and information technology vendors. Any disruption in access to the websites developed and hosted by these third-party providers or any failure of these third-party providers to handle current or higher volumes of use could significantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties our providers face may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which we cannot predict. We exercise little or no control over all of these third-party vendors, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide.\nIn addition, we license technology and related databases from third parties to facilitate aspects of our website and connectivity operations. Any errors, failures, interruptions or delays experienced in connection with these third-party technologies and information services could materially and negatively impact our relationship with our customers and adversely affect our brand and our business. It is possible that such errors, failures, interruptions or delays could even expose us to liabilities to our customers or other third parties.\nInterruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems would impair our ability to effectively provide our services, which could in turn damage our reputation and harm our business.\nOur ability to provide our services critically depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems. Any damage to or failure of our systems would likely result in interruptions in our service to customers and the closings of real estate transactions from which we principally derive revenue. Accordingly, interruptions in our service would likely reduce our revenues and profits, and our brand could be damaged, perhaps irreparably, if people believe our system and services are unreliable.\nTo our knowledge, our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from terrorist or malicious attacks, floods, tornados, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses and other attempts to harm our systems, and similar types of events. Our data centers are subject to break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism, and to other potential disruptions. Some of our systems are not fully redundant (i.e., backed up), and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster, or a decision to close a facility we are using without adequate notice for financial reasons or other unanticipated problems at our data centers, could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. Any unscheduled interruption in our service would likely place a burden on our entire organization and result in an immediate loss of revenue. The steps we have taken to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems are expensive, reduce our operating margin and even then may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime.\nOur operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our intellectual property, which could be costly.\nOur technology is the cornerstone of our business and our success will depend in part upon protecting any technology we use or may develop from infringement, misappropriation, duplication and discovery, and avoiding infringement and misappropriation of third party rights. Our intellectual property is essential to our business, and our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends on the proprietary nature of our technologies. We do not have patent protection for our proprietary video on demand technology. We rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop, maintain, and strengthen our competitive position. Although we have confidentiality provisions in the agreements with our employees and independent contractors, there can be no assurance that such agreements can fully protect our intellectual property, be enforced in a timely manner or that any such employees or consultants will not violate their agreements with us.\nFurthermore, we may have to take legal action in the future to protect our trade secrets or know-how, or to defend them against claimed infringement of the rights of others. Any legal action of that type could be costly and time-consuming to us, and there can be no assure that such actions will be successful. The invalidation of key proprietary rights which we own or unsuccessful outcomes in lawsuits to protect our intellectual property may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we cannot adequately protect our intellectual property rights, our competitors may be able to compete more directly with us, which could adversely affect our competitive position and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur certificate of incorporation grants our Board of Directors, without any action or approval by our stockholders, the power to issue additional shares of capital stock, including the power to designate additional classes of common and preferred stock.\nOur authorized capital consists of 500,000,000 shares of common stock, and as of February 28, 2015, 21,108,347 are outstanding; authorized Preferred Stock, of which 3,000,000 shares have been designated as Series A Preferred Stock, of which 2,216,014 shares are outstanding; 3,000,000 shares have been designated as Series B Preferred stock, of which 262,200 shares are outstanding; 3,000,000 shares have been designated as Series C Preferred stock, of which 217,600 shares are outstanding and 3,000,000 shares have been designated as Series D Preferred stock, of which 838,800 shares are outstanding. Pursuant to authority granted by our certificate of incorporation and applicable state law, our Board of Directors, without any action or approval by our stockholders, may designate and issue shares in such classes or series (including other classes or series of preferred stock) as it deems appropriate and establish the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares, including dividends, liquidation and voting rights. The rights of holders of other classes or series of capital stock, including preferred stock that may be issued could be superior to the rights of the shares of common stock offered hereby. The designation and issuance of shares of capital stock having preferential rights could adversely affect other rights appurtenant to the shares of our common stock. Finally, any issuances of additional capital stock (common or preferred) will dilute the percentage of ownership interest of our stockholders and may dilute the per-share book value of the Company.\nWe may not be able to maintain our client relationships that we have developed.\nOur clients are, and will be, comprised primarily of travel agencies, cruise lines, real estate agents and brokers, and national consumer lifestyle product advertisers. This clientele is fragmented and requires a great deal of servicing to maintain strong relationships. Our ability to maintain client loyalty will be dependent upon our ability to successfully market and distribute their products. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining relationships with any of our clients. Our inability to maintain these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may encounter intense competition from substantially larger and better financed companies.\nOur success will depend upon our ability to continue to penetrate the consumer market for media-oriented products and establish a television network with sufficient ratings to cover the costs associated with operating the network and provide a return to our investors. Our Television Network, Travel Company and Real Estate business will compete with more established entities with greater financial resources, longer operating histories and more recognition in the market place than we do. It is also possible that previously unidentified competitors may enter the market place and decrease our chance of acquiring the requisite market share. Our future success will depend upon our continued ability to penetrate the market quickly and efficiently. Our ability to respond to competitive product offerings and the evolving demands of the marketplace will play a key role in our success. Our failure to develop, maintain and continually improve our distribution process could prevent us from attaining and maintaining sufficient market share. If we are unable to respond and compete in these markets, it will have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain legal proceedings and regulatory matters could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe are involved in certain legal proceedings and are subject from time to time to various claims involving alleged breach of contract claims, intellectual property and other related claims employment issues, vendor matters and other litigations. Certain of these lawsuits and claims, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, could result in material liability to the Company or have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s reputation or relations with its employees, customers, licensees or other third parties. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings could result in substantial costs and may require that the Company devotes substantial time and resources to defend itself. Further, changes in governmental regulations both in the U.S. and in other countries where we conduct business operations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. See Item 3 - \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for further discussion of the Company\u2019s legal matters.\nWe may not be able to adequately manage future growth.\nIf we are successful in implementing our business plan to maturity, the anticipated future growth of the business could place a significant strain on our managerial, operational and financial resources. We cannot assure you that management would effectively manage significant growth in our business. If we are successful in executing our business plan and achieve our anticipated growth, such success will place significant demands on our management, as well as on our administrative, operational and financial resources. For us to manage our growth and satisfy the greater financial disclosure and internal control requirements that arise with exiting the development stage and becoming fully operational, we must:\n\u2022 upgrade our operational, financial, accounting and management information systems, which would include the purchase of new accounting and human resources software;\n\u2022 identify and hire an adequate number of operating, accounting and administrative personnel and other qualified employees;\n\u2022 manage new employees and integrate them into our culture;\n\u2022 incorporate effectively the components of any businesses or assets that we may acquire in our effort to achieve or support growth;\n\u2022 closely monitor the actions of our broadcast entities and manage the contractual relationships we have with them; and\n\u2022 develop and improve financial and disclosure processes to satisfy the reporting requirements of the SEC, including Section 404 of the Sarbanes-OxleyAct of 2002, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.\nThe failure to adequately manage any growth would adversely affect our business operations and financial results.\nWilliam Kerby and Don Monaco own approximately 66% of our voting securities which gives them significant influence over the affairs of our Company.\nWilliam Kerby (CEO and Chairman) and Don Monaco (Director), collectively control approximately 66% of our voting securities which gives them voting control over our Company. Mr. Kerby owns 809,611 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Mr. Monaco owns 1,075,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is equal to 100 votes and votes on the same basis as the common stock. As a result, Messrs. Kerby and Monaco collectively control approximately 66% of our voting securities, thereby giving them significant influence in electing our directors and appointing management, possibly delaying or preventing mergers or deals and suppressing the value of our common stock.\nWe may be unable to adequately react to market changes which may require us to implement new technologies that can be costly and time consuming.\nThe Company\u2019s success in its business will depend in part upon its continued ability to enhance its existing products and services, to introduce new products and services quickly and cost effectively to meet evolving customer needs, to achieve market acceptance for new product and service offerings and to respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to respond effectively to technological changes or new industry standards. Moreover, there can be no assurance that competitors of the Company will not develop competitive products, or that any such competitive products will not have an adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThere are potential conflicts of interests and agreements that are not subject to arm\u2019s length negotiations.\nThere may be conflicts of interest between our management and our non-management stockholders. Some of our officers, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer are executive officers of RealBiz and therefore are currently working for the Company on a part-time basis. Several of the part-time employees also work at other jobs and have discretion to decide what time they devote to our activities, which may result in a lack of availability when needed due to responsibilities at other jobs.\nConflicts of interest create the risk that management may have an incentive to act adversely to the interests of other investors. A conflict of interest may arise between our management\u2019s personal pecuniary interest and its fiduciary duty to our stockholders. Further, our management\u2019s own pecuniary interest may at some point compromise its fiduciary duty to our stockholders. In addition, our officers and directors are currently involved with other blank check companies and conflicts in the pursuit of business combinations with such other blank check companies with which they and other members of our management are, and may in the future be affiliated with, may arise. If we and the other blank check companies that our officers and directors are affiliated with desire to take advantage of the same opportunity, then those officers and directors that are affiliated with both companies would abstain from voting upon the opportunity. In the event of identical officers and directors, the officers and directors will arbitrarily determine the entity that will be entitled to proceed with the proposed transaction.\nRisks Related to Investment in Our Securities\nThere is not presently an active market for shares of our common stock, and therefore, you may be unable to sell any shares of common stock in the event that you need a source of liquidity.\nAlthough our common stock is quoted on the OTCQB, the trading market in our common stock has substantially less liquidity than the trading in stock on other markets or stock of other companies quoted on the OTCQB. A public trading market in our common stock having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the market of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. In the event an active market does not develop, you may be unable to sell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid for them or at any price.\nExisting stockholders may suffer substantial dilution with future issuances of our common stock.\nWe may continue to issue a large amount of securities or debt that can be converted into common stock within the next several years, either in connection with our equity incentive plan for directors, officers, employees and consultants, or in private or public offerings to meet our working capital requirements. In addition, we have convertible debt of $7.9 million that can be converted to 10,776,616 shares and 23,223,252 outstanding warrants that can convert to 23,223,252 shares. Also, there are currently 2,216,014 shares of the Company\u2019s Series A Preferred Stock, which are convertible into 221,601,400 shares of common stock at $0.01. There are also other classes of Preferred Stock that can be converted to common stock. Any grants or sales of additional shares of our common stock, or exercise of our convertible instruments will have a dilutive effect on the existing stockholders, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls, and we cannot provide assurances that these weaknesses will be effectively remediated or that additional material weaknesses will not occur in the future. If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud, or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nOur most recent evaluation of our internal controls resulted in our conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures and that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. In our case, our failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud. This may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nOur lack of an independent audit committee and audit committee financial expert at this time may hinder our board of directors\u2019 effectiveness in fulfilling the functions of the audit committee without undue influence from management and until we establish such committee will prevent us from obtaining a listing on a national securities exchange.\nAlthough our common stock is not listed on any national securities exchange, for purposes of independence we use the definition of independence applied by NASDAQ. Currently, we have no independent audit committee. Our full board of directors functions as our audit committee and is comprised of five directors, two of whom are considered to be \u201cindependent\u201d in accordance with the requirements set forth in NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(a)(2). An independent audit committee plays a crucial role in the corporate governance process, assessing our Company\u2019s processes relating to our risks and control environment, overseeing financial reporting, and evaluating internal and independent audit processes. The lack of an independent audit committee may prevent the board of directors from being independent from management in its judgments and decisions and its ability to pursue the responsibilities of an audit committee without undue influence. We may have difficulty attracting and retaining directors with the requisite qualifications. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified, independent directors, the management of our business could be compromised. An independent audit committee is required for listing on any national securities exchange, therefore until such time as we meet the audit committee independence requirements of a national securities exchange we will be ineligible for listing on any national securities exchange.\nOur board of directors act as our compensation committee, which presents the risk that compensation and benefits paid to those executive officers who are board members and other officers may not be commensurate with our financial performance.\nA compensation committee consisting of independent directors is a safeguard against self-dealing by company executives. Our board of directors acts as the compensation committee and determines the compensation and benefits of our executive officers, administers our employee stock and benefit plans, and reviews policies relating to the compensation and benefits of our employees. Our lack of an independent compensation committee presents the risk that our executive officer on the board may have influence over his personal compensation and benefits levels that may not be commensurate with our financial performance.\nWe have never paid cash dividends and do not anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid a cash dividend and we do not expect to have any cash with which to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. If we do have available cash, we intend to use it to grow our business.\nOur incorporation documents and Nevada law may inhibit a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also limit the market price of your shares of common stock, which may inhibit an attempt by our stockholders to change our direction or management.\nNevada law and our certificate of incorporation contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our Company. Some of these provisions include the following:\n(a) authorize our board of directors to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to, or imposed upon, the preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series without further action by our stockholders; and\n(b) Prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates.\nThese and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and under Nevada law could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions.\nWe adopted provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation limiting the liability of management to stockholders.\nWe have adopted provisions, and will maintain provisions, to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that limit the liability of our directors, and provide for indemnification by us of our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Nevada law. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and Nevada law provides that directors have no personal liability to third parties for monetary damages for actions taken as a director, except for breach of duty of loyalty, acts or omissions not in good faith involving intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law, unlawful payment of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases, or transactions from which the director derived improper personal benefit. Such provisions limit the stockholders\u2019 ability to hold directors liable for breaches of fiduciary duty and reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers.\nWe are subject to the penny stock rules, which may adversely affect trading in our common stock.\nCurrently our common stock is a \u201clow-priced\u201d security under the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In accordance with these rules, broker-dealers participating in transactions in low-priced securities must first deliver a risk disclosure document that describes the risks associated with such stocks, the broker-dealers\u2019 duties in selling the stock, the customer\u2019s rights and remedies and certain market and other information. Furthermore, the broker-dealer must make a suitability determination approving the customer for low-priced stock transactions based on the customer\u2019s financial situation, investment experience and objectives. Broker-dealers must also disclose these restrictions in writing to the customer, obtain specific written consent from the customer, and provide monthly account statements to the customer. The effect of these restrictions will probably decrease the willingness of broker- dealers to make a market in our common stock, decrease liquidity of our common stock and increase transaction costs for sales and purchases of our common stock as compared to other securities. Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market. Although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent abuses normally associated with \u201clow-priced\u201d securities from being established with respect to our securities.\nAs an issuer of \u201cpenny stock,\u201d the protection provided by the federal securities laws relating to forward looking statements does not apply to us.\nAlthough federal securities laws provide a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by a public company that files reports under the federal securities laws, this safe harbor is not available to issuers of penny stocks. As a result, the Company will not have the benefit of this safe harbor protection in the event of any legal action based upon a claim that the material provided by the Company contained a material misstatement of fact or was misleading in any material respect because of the Company\u2019s failure to include any statements necessary to make the statements not misleading. Such an action could hurt our financial condition.", "PERMNO": 17324, "SIC": 4700, "TIC": "MKGI"}
