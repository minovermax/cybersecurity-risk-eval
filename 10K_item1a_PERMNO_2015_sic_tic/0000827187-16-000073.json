RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the specific risks set forth below and other matters described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before making an investment decision. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties, including risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently see as immaterial, may also harm our business. If any of these risks occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nCurrent and future economic conditions could materially adversely affect our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur success depends significantly upon discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by a number of general economic factors, including without limitation economic growth, consumer confidence, the housing market, employment and income levels, interest rates, inflation, taxation and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers. Adverse trends in any of these economic factors may adversely affect our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition. Continued adverse impacts from the ERP implementation may adversely affect our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur future growth and profitability depends upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing programs.\nWe are highly dependent on the effectiveness of our marketing messages and the efficiency of our advertising expenditures in generating consumer awareness and sales of our products. We continue to evolve our marketing strategies, adjusting our messages, the amount we spend on advertising and where we spend it. We may not always be successful in developing effective messages, as the consumer and competition changes, and in achieving efficiency in our advertising expenditures.\nConsumers are increasingly using digital tools as a part of their shopping experience. As a result, our future growth and profitability will depend in part on (i) the effectiveness and efficiency of our on-line experience including advertising and search optimization programs in generating consumer awareness and sales of our products, (ii) our ability to prevent confusion among consumers that can result from search engines that allow competitors to use or bid on our trademarks to direct consumers to competitors\u2019 websites, (iii) our ability to prevent Internet publication of false or misleading information regarding our products or our competitors\u2019 products; (iv) the nature and tone of consumer sentiment published on various social media sites; and (v) the stability of our website.\nIf our marketing messages are ineffective or our advertising expenditures and other marketing programs, including digital programs, are inefficient in creating awareness and consideration of our products and brand name, in driving consumer traffic to our website or stores, our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely impacted. In addition, if we are not effective in preventing the publication of confusing, false or misleading information regarding our brand or our products, or if there was significant negative consumer sentiment on social media regarding our brand or our products, our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely impacted.\nOur future growth and profitability depends on our ability to execute our Company-Controlled distribution strategy.\nThe vast majority of our sales occur through our Company-Controlled distribution channel, including our retail stores, and this Company-Controlled distribution channel represents our largest opportunity for growth in sales and improvement in profitability. Our retail stores carry significant fixed costs. We also make significant capital expenditures as we open new stores and remodel or reposition existing stores. We are highly dependent on our ability to maintain and increase sales per store to cover these fixed expenses, provide a return on our capital investments and improve our operating margins.\nOur stores are largely mall-based. We depend on the continued popularity of malls as shopping destinations and the ability of mall anchor tenants and other attractions to generate customer traffic for our retail stores. Any decrease in mall traffic could adversely affect our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur Company-Controlled distribution strategy results in relatively few points of distribution, including approximately 490 retail stores across the continental United States as of the end of 2015. Several of the mattress manufacturers and retailers with which we compete have significantly more points of distribution than we do, which makes us highly dependent on our ability to drive consumers to our points of distribution in order to gain market share.\nOur longer term Company-Controlled distribution strategy is also dependent on our ability to renew existing store leases and to secure suitable locations for new store openings, in each case on a cost-effective basis. We may encounter higher than anticipated rents and other costs in connection with managing our retail store base, or may be unable to find or obtain suitable new locations.\nFailure to achieve and maintain a high level of product quality could negatively impact our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur products represent a significant departure from traditional innerspring mattresses and from viscoelastic foam mattresses, which have little or no technology and do not rely on electronics and air control systems. As a result, our beds may be susceptible to failures that do not exist with traditional or viscoelastic foam mattresses. Failure to achieve and maintain acceptable quality standards could impact consumer acceptance of our products or could result in negative media and Internet reports or owner dissatisfaction that could negatively impact our brand image and sales levels.\nIn addition, a decline in product quality could result in an increase in return rates and a corresponding decrease in sales, or an increase in product warranty claims in excess of our warranty reserves. An unexpected increase in return rates or warranty claims could harm our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nAs a consumer innovation company with differentiated products, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in personal injury or property damage. In the event that any of our products proves to be defective, we may be required to recall or redesign such products. We have at times experienced increased returns and adverse impacts on sales, as well as product liability litigation, as a result of media reports related to the alleged propensity of our products to develop mold. We may experience additional adverse impacts on sales and additional litigation in the event any similar media reports were to occur in the future. We maintain insurance against some forms of product liability claims, but such coverage may not be adequate for liabilities actually incurred. A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage, or any claim or product recall that results in significant adverse publicity against us, may have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur future growth and profitability depends in part on our ability to continue to improve and expand our product line.\nAs described in greater detail below, the mattress industry, as well as the market for sleep monitoring products, are both highly competitive, and our ability to compete effectively and to profitably grow our market share depends in part on our ability to continue to improve and expand our product line of adjustable firmness air beds, SleepIQ\u00ae technology and related accessory products. We incur significant research and development and other expenditures in the pursuit of improvements and additions to our product line. If these efforts do not result in meaningful product improvements or new product introductions, or if we are not able to gain widespread consumer acceptance of product improvements or new product introductions, our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition, if any significant product improvements or new product introductions are not successful, our reputation and brand image may be adversely affected.\nSignificant competition could adversely affect our business.\nBecause of the vertical integration of our business model, our products and distribution channels face significant competition from both manufacturers of different types of mattresses and a variety of retailers. Our SleepIQ\u00ae technology also faces significant competition from various manufacturers and retailers of sleep tracking and monitoring products.\nThe mattress industry is characterized by a high degree of concentration among the largest manufacturers of innerspring mattresses and viscoelastic foam mattresses and one dominant national mattress retailer. Several newer competitors in the mattress industry have begun to offer \u201cbed-in-a-box\u201d or similar entry-level products directly to consumers through the Internet and other distribution channels.\nOur national, exclusive distribution competes with other retailers who generally provide a wider selection of mattress alternatives than we offer. A number of these retailers also have more points of distribution and greater brand name recognition than we do.\nA variety of sleep tracking and monitoring products that compete with our SleepIQ\u00ae technology have been introduced by various manufacturers and retailers, both within and outside of the traditional mattress industry.\nSome of the manufacturers and retailers that we compete with have substantially greater financial, marketing and manufacturing resources and better brand name recognition than we do and sell products through broader and more established distribution channels.\nThese manufacturing and retailing competitors, or new entrants into the market, may compete aggressively and gain market share with existing or new products, and may pursue or expand their presence in the adjustable firmness air bed segment of the market as well as in the market for sleep tracking and monitoring products. We have limited ability to anticipate the timing and scale of new product introductions, advertising campaigns or new pricing strategies by our competitors, which could inhibit our ability to retain or increase market share, or to maintain our product margins.\nIf we are unable to effectively compete with other manufacturers and retailers of mattress and sleep tracking and monitoring products, our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely impacted.\nOur intellectual property rights may not prevent others from using our technology or trademarks in connection with the sale of competitive products. We may be subject to claims that our products, processes or trademarks infringe intellectual property rights of others.\nWe own various U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to certain elements of the design and function of our beds and related products. We also own several registered and unregistered trademarks and trademark applications, including in particular our Sleep Number trademarks, which we believe have significant value and are important to the marketing of our products. These intellectual property rights may not provide sufficient protection against infringement or piracy and may not prevent our competitors from developing and marketing products that are similar to or competitive with our beds or other products. Our patents are also subject to varying expiration dates. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights and confidential information to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may be unable to prevent other companies from using our technology or trademarks in connection with competitive products, which could adversely affect our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to claims that our products, processes or trademarks infringe the intellectual property rights of others. The defense of these claims, even if we are ultimately successful, may result in costly litigation, and if we are not successful in our defense, we could be subject to injunctions, liability for damages or royalty obligations and our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nA reduction in the availability of credit to consumers generally or under our existing consumer credit programs could harm our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nA significant percentage of our sales are made under consumer credit programs through third parties. The recent economic downturn resulted in a reduction of credit available to consumers as macroeconomic factors impacted the financial position of consumers and as suppliers of credit adjusted their lending criteria. In addition, changes in federal regulations effective in 2010 placed additional restrictions on all consumer credit programs, including limiting the types of promotional credit offerings that may be offered to consumers.\nSynchrony Bank provides credit to our customers through a private label credit card agreement that is currently scheduled to expire on December 31, 2020, subject to earlier termination upon certain events. Synchrony Bank has discretion to control the content of financing offers to our customers and to set minimum credit standards under which credit is extended to customers.\nReduction of credit availability due to changing economic conditions, changes in credit standards under our private label credit card program or changes in regulatory requirements, or the termination of our agreement with Synchrony Bank, could harm our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe utilize \u201cjust-in-time\u201d manufacturing processes with minimal levels of inventory, which could leave us vulnerable to shortages in supply of components that may harm our ability to satisfy consumer demand and may adversely impact our sales and profitability.\nA significant percentage of our products are assembled after we receive orders from customers utilizing \u201cjust-in-time\u201d manufacturing processes with minimal levels of raw materials, work-in-process inventories and finished goods inventories. Lead times for ordered components may vary significantly. In addition, some components used to manufacture our products are provided on a sole source basis. Any unexpected shortage of materials caused by any disruption of supply or an unexpected increase in the demand for our products, could lead to delays in shipping our beds to customers. Any such delays could adversely affect our sales, customer satisfaction, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe rely upon several key suppliers that are, in some instances, the only source of supply currently used by us for particular materials, components or services. A disruption in the supply or substantial increase in cost of any of these products or services could harm our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe currently obtain all of the materials and components used to produce our beds from outside sources including some who are located outside the U.S. In several cases, including our proprietary air chambers, our proprietary blow-molded foundations, our adjustable foundations, various components for our Firmness Control Systems, as well as fabrics and zippers, we have chosen to obtain these materials and components from suppliers who serve as the only source of supply, or who supply the vast majority of our needs of the particular material or component. While we believe that these materials and components, or suitable replacements, could be obtained from other sources, in the event of a disruption or loss of supply of relevant materials or components for any reason, we may not be able to find alternative sources of supply, or if found, may not be found on comparable terms. If our relationship with the primary supplier of our air chambers, the supplier of our blow-molded foundations or the supplier of our adjustable foundations is terminated, we could have difficulty in replacing these sources since there are relatively few other suppliers presently capable of manufacturing these components.\nSimilarly, we rely on UPS and other carriers to deliver some of our products to customers on a timely and cost-effective basis. Any significant delay in deliveries to our customers could lead to increased returns and cause us to lose sales. Any increase in freight charges could increase our costs of doing business and harm our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nFluctuations in commodity prices could result in an increase in component costs and/or delivery costs.\nOur business is subject to significant increases or volatility in the prices of certain commodities, including but not limited to fuel, oil, natural gas, rubber, cotton, plastic resin, steel and chemical ingredients used to produce foam. Increases in prices of these commodities or other inflationary pressures may result in significant cost increases for our raw materials and product components, as well as increases in the cost of delivering our products to our customers. To the extent we are unable to offset any such increased costs through value engineering and similar initiatives, or through price increases, our profitability, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely impacted. If we choose to increase prices to offset the increased costs, our unit sales volumes could be adversely impacted.\nOur business is subject to risks inherent in global sourcing activities.\nOur air chambers and some of our other components are manufactured outside the United States, and therefore are subject to risks associated with foreign sourcing of materials, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nPolitical instability resulting in disruption of trade;\n\u2022\nExisting or potential duties, tariffs or quotas on certain types of goods that may be imported into the United States;\n\u2022\nDisruptions in transportation due to acts of terrorism, shipping delays, foreign or domestic dock strikes, customs inspections or other factors;\n\u2022\nForeign currency fluctuations; and\n\u2022\nEconomic uncertainties, including inflation.\nThese factors could increase our costs of doing business with foreign suppliers, lead to inadequate inventory levels or delays in shipping beds to our customers, which could harm our sales, customer satisfaction, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nDisruption of operations in either of our two main manufacturing facilities could increase our costs of doing business or lead to delays in shipping our beds.\nWe have two main manufacturing plants, which are located in Irmo, South Carolina and Salt Lake City, Utah. A significant percentage of our products are assembled to fulfill orders rather than stocking finished goods inventory in our plants or stores. Therefore, the disruption of operations of either of our two main manufacturing facilities for a significant period of time may increase our costs of doing business and lead to delays in shipping our beds to customers. Such delays could adversely affect our sales, customer satisfaction, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur manufacturing and retail operations are subject to a wide variety of government regulations which could increase costs or cause disruptions to our operations.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of government regulations relating to the bedding industry or to various aspects of our business and operations, including without limitation, regulations relating to the proper labeling of bedding merchandise; flammability standards applicable to mattresses; environmental and product safety regulations; consumer protection and data privacy regulations; various \u201cdo\nnot call\u201d or \u201cdo not mail\u201d list requirements; labor laws, including but not limited to laws relating to occupational health and safety, employee privacy, wages and hours, overtime pay, harassment and discrimination, equal opportunity, and employee leaves and benefits; and import and export regulations.\nAlthough we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these regulations and have implemented a variety of measures to promote continuing compliance, regulations may change over time, and we may be required to incur expenses and/or to modify our operations in order to ensure compliance with these regulations or we may be found to be in violation of the foregoing laws or regulations, which could harm our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nAdopted or proposed legislation in various states would impose responsibilities with respect to end-of-life disposal of various consumer or durable goods on the manufacturers and/or retailers of such goods, including mattresses. To the extent that any such legislation becomes effective in the states in which we sell or have sold mattresses and related products, we may be required to incur significant costs and operational changes in order to comply with these requirements, which may adversely impact our profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nRegulatory requirements related to flammability standards for mattresses may increase our product costs and increase the risk of disruption to our business.\nThe federal Consumer Product Safety Commission adopted new flammability standards and related regulations which became effective nationwide in July 2007 for mattresses and mattress and foundation sets. Compliance with these requirements has resulted in higher materials and manufacturing costs for our products, and has required modifications to our information systems and business operations, further increasing our costs and negatively impacting our capacity.\nThese regulations require manufacturers to implement quality assurance programs and encourage manufacturers to conduct random testing of products. These regulations also require maintenance and retention of compliance documentation. These quality assurance and documentation requirements are costly to implement and maintain. If any product testing, other evidence, or regulatory inspections yield results indicating that any of our products may not meet the flammability standard, we may be required to temporarily cease production and distribution and/or to recall products from the field, and we may be subject to fines or penalties, any of which outcomes could harm our business, reputation, sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe implementation of a new ERP system in the fourth quarter of 2015 caused disruption to our customer delivery and service capabilities and may result in ongoing adverse impacts to our business and damage to our brand reputation.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, we implemented a new enterprise resource planning, or \u201cERP,\u201d system to replace our legacy management information systems. The implementation of this new ERP system caused disruption to our customer delivery and service capabilities throughout much of the fourth quarter of 2015 and early in 2016. This disruption led to significant lost sales, inefficiencies in our business operations, negative customer sentiment in social media and potential damage to our brand reputation. These adverse impacts have continued to some degree in 2016 as we continue to implement operational improvements under the new ERP system.\nAny improvements or upgrades to our management information systems that may be required to meet the evolving needs of our business as well as existing and emerging regulatory requirements may be costly to implement and may take longer or require greater resources than anticipated, and may result in disruptions to our systems or business.\nWe depend on our management information systems for many aspects of our business. As noted above, in the fourth quarter of 2015 we implemented a new ERP system and continue to implement operational improvements under this new system. If our new systems are disrupted in any material way, or improvements or upgrades are required to meet the evolving needs of our business and existing and emerging regulatory requirements, we may be required to incur significant capital expenditures in the pursuit of improvements or upgrades to our management information systems. These efforts may take longer and may require greater financial and other resources than anticipated, may cause distraction of key personnel, and may cause short-term disruptions to our existing systems and our business. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to achieve critical strategic initiatives and could adversely impact our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur information systems may be subject to attacks by hackers or other cyber threats that could compromise the security of our systems, which could substantially disrupt our business and could result in the breach of consumers' or employees' private data.\nOur information systems contain personal information related to our customers and employees in the ordinary course of our business, such as credit card and demographic information of our customers and social security numbers and demographic information of our employees. While we maintain security measures to protect this information, a breach of these security measures, such as through\nthird-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, could compromise the security of our customers\u2019 and employees\u2019 personal information. As the techniques used to breach such security measures change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Any failure of our systems and processes to adequately protect customer or employee personal information from theft or loss could adversely impact our business, reputation, sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur future growth and profitability depends in part upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nAs a vertically integrated manufacturer and retailer, our future growth and profitability will depend in part upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel in a wide variety of areas to execute our growth strategy, including qualified management and executive personnel and qualified retail sales professionals and managers. The failure to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and growth initiatives and may adversely impact our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 86489, "SIC": 2510, "TIC": "SNBR"}
