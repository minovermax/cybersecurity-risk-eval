{"cik": "1267813", "company": "MARINUS PHARMACEUTICALS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. The occurrence of any of the following risks and uncertainties, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Risks and uncertainties of general applicability and additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nRisks Related to our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses in the future.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since our inception, including a net loss of $54.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $235.6 million. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital. Our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in our research and development activities. We anticipate that our operating losses will substantially increase over the next several years as we execute our plan to expand our research, development and commercialization activities, including the clinical development and planned commercialization of our product candidate, ganaxolone. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval of ganaxolone, we may incur significant sales and marketing expenses. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or whether or when we will become profitable, if ever. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, such that a period-to-period comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance. In any particular quarter or quarters, our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe have not generated any revenue to date from product sales. We may never achieve or sustain profitability, which could depress the market price of our common stock, and could cause you to lose all or a part of your investment.\nWe have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from sales of any of our product candidates, and we do not know when, or if, we will generate revenues in the future. Our ability to generate revenue from product sales and achieve profitability will depend upon our ability to successfully gain regulatory approval and commercialize ganaxolone or other product candidates that we may develop, in-license or acquire in the future. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for ganaxolone, we do not know when we will generate revenue from\nproduct sales, if at all. Our ability to generate revenue from product sales of ganaxolone or any other future product candidates also depends on a number of additional factors, including our ability to:\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully complete clinical development activities, including enrollment of clinical trial participants, completion of the necessary clinical trials and attainment of clinical trial results that will support regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7\ncomplete and submit NDAs to the FDA and obtain regulatory approval for indications for which there is a commercial market;\n\u00b7\ncomplete and submit applications to, and obtain regulatory approval from, foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\nmake or have made commercial quantities of our products at acceptable cost levels;\n\u00b7\ndevelop a commercial organization capable of manufacturing, selling, marketing and distributing any products we intend to sell ourselves in the markets in which we choose to commercialize on our own;\n\u00b7\nfind suitable partners to help us market, sell and distribute our approved products in other markets;\n\u00b7\nobtain adequate pricing, coverage and reimbursement from third parties, including government and private payers;\n\u00b7\nlaunch and commercialize product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval;\n\u00b7\nobtain market acceptance of our product candidates as viable treatment options;\n\u00b7\naddress any competing technological and market developments;\n\u00b7\nimplement additional internal systems and infrastructure, as needed;\n\u00b7\nidentify and validate new product candidates;\n\u00b7\nnegotiate favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter;\n\u00b7\nmaintain, protect and expand our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets and know-how; and\n\u00b7\nattract, hire and retain qualified personnel.\nIn addition, because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, including that ganaxolone may not advance through development or achieve the endpoints of applicable clinical trials, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, or if or when we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the FDA or other regulatory agencies, domestic or foreign, to perform clinical trials or other studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate. Even if we are able to complete the development and regulatory process for ganaxolone, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing ganaxolone.\nEven if we are able to generate revenue from the sale of ganaxolone or any future commercial products, we may not become profitable and will need to obtain additional funding to continue operations. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, and we are not successful in obtaining additional funding, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels, or at all, which would likely materially and adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock.\nWe will require additional capital to fund our operations and if we fail to obtain necessary financing, we may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of ganaxolone.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to advance the clinical and regulatory development of ganaxolone and, if approved, commercialize ganaxolone. We will require additional capital for the further development, regulatory submission and potential commercialization of ganaxolone and may also need to raise additional funds sooner should we choose to accelerate development of ganaxolone. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts.\nWe believe that our cash, cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2019, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the third quarter of 2021. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future funding requirements, both near and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to the:\n\u00b7\ninitiation, progress, timing, costs and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, including patient enrollment in such trials, for ganaxolone or any other future product candidates;\n\u00b7\nclinical development plans we establish for ganaxolone and any other future product candidates;\n\u00b7\nobligation to make royalty and non-royalty sublicense receipt payments to third-party licensors, if any, under our licensing agreements;\n\u00b7\nnumber and characteristics of product candidates that we discover or in-license and develop;\n\u00b7\noutcome, timing and cost of regulatory review by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to require that we perform more studies than those that we currently expect;\n\u00b7\ncosts of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and maintaining and enforcing other intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\neffects of competing technological and market developments;\n\u00b7\ncosts and timing of the implementation of commercial-scale manufacturing activities; and\n\u00b7\ncosts and timing of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for ganaxolone or any other product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval.\nIf we are unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities due to a lack of capital, our ability to become profitable will be compromised. Failure to progress our product development or commercialization of ganaxolone as anticipated will have a negative effect on our business, future prospects and ability to obtain further financing on acceptable terms, if at all, and the value of the enterprise, which could require us to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nsignificantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of ganaxolone or one or more of our other research and development initiatives;\n\u00b7\nseek collaborators for one or more of our current or future product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available;\n\u00b7\nsell or license on unfavorable terms our rights to ganaxolone or one of our future product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves; or\n\u00b7\nseek bankruptcy protection.\nRaising additional capital could dilute our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to ganaxolone or any other future product candidates.\nUntil we can generate substantial revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings, strategic collaborations and alliances, licensing arrangements and other strategic transactions and funding opportunities. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of stockholders will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include liens or restrictive covenants limiting our ability to take important actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through strategic collaborations and alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to ganaxolone or any other future product candidates in particular countries, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market ganaxolone or any other future product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nWe intend to expend our limited resources to pursue our sole clinical stage product candidate, ganaxolone, and may fail to capitalize on other indications, technologies or product candidates that may be more profitable or for which there may be a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we are focusing on research programs relating to ganaxolone, which concentrates the risk of product failure in the event ganaxolone proves to be ineffective or inadequate for clinical development or commercialization. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities for other technologies or product candidates that later could prove to have greater commercial potential. We may be unable to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities as a result of our resource allocation decisions. Our spending on proprietary research and development programs relating to ganaxolone may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for ganaxolone, we may relinquish valuable rights to ganaxolone through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to ganaxolone.\nWe have a limited operating history, which may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nOur operations to date have been limited to conducting preclinical and clinical development activities for ganaxolone and performing research and development with respect to our preclinical clinical and clinical programs. In addition, as a clinical stage pharmaceutical company, we have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the pharmaceutical area. Nor have we demonstrated an ability to obtain regulatory approval to commercialize any of our product candidates. Consequently, any predictions about our future performance may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a history of successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products. Further, our budgeted expense levels are based in part on our expectations concerning the costs of our research, preclinical development and clinical trials, which depend on the success of such activities, and our ability to effectively and efficiently conduct such research, preclinical development, clinical trials and our expectations related to our efforts to achieve FDA approval with respect to ganaxolone and any other product candidates. Our limited operating history and clinical trial experience make these costs difficult to forecast accurately. We may be unable to adjust our operations in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected increase in costs. Further, our manufacturing costs and operating expenses may increase significantly as we expand our operations. Accordingly, a significant increase in costs could have an immediate and material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had U.S. net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards of approximately $143.7 million for U.S. federal income tax and approximately $141.5 million for state income tax purposes available to offset future taxable income and U.S. federal and state research and development tax credits of approximately $8.4 million, prior to consideration of annual limitations that may be imposed under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or Section 382. Our U.S. NOL carryforwards begin to expire in 2023 if not utilized.\nOur U.S. NOL and tax credit carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Under Section 382, and corresponding provisions of U.S. state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change U.S. NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research and development tax credits, to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have completed several financings since our inception that may have resulted in \u201cownership changes\u201d within the meaning of Section 382. We have not evaluated the ownership history of our company to determine if there were any ownership changes as defined under Section 382 and the effects any ownership change may have had. We may experience additional ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, including through completed or contemplated financings, some of which may be outside of our control. If we determine that a future ownership change has occurred and our ability to use our historical net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations.\nRisks Related to Clinical Development and Regulatory Approval of our Product Candidates\nOur future success is dependent on the successful clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization of ganaxolone, which is being studied in five clinical trials and will require significant capital resources and years of additional clinical development effort.\nWe do not have any products that have gained regulatory approval. Our only clinical stage product candidate is ganaxolone. As a result, our business is dependent on our ability to successfully complete clinical development of, scale-up manufacturing, obtain regulatory approval for, and, if approved, commercialize ganaxolone in a timely manner. We cannot commercialize ganaxolone in the United States without first obtaining regulatory approval from the FDA; similarly, we cannot commercialize ganaxolone outside of the United States without obtaining regulatory approval from comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of ganaxolone for a target indication, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence gathered in preclinical studies and clinical trials, generally including two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, and, with respect to approval in the United States, to the satisfaction of the FDA, that ganaxolone is safe and effective for use for that target indication and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate. Even if ganaxolone were to obtain approval from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, any approval might contain significant limitations, such as restrictions as to specified age groups, warnings, precautions or contraindications, or may be subject to burdensome post-approval trial or risk management requirements. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for ganaxolone in one or more jurisdictions, or any approval contains significant limitations, we may not be able to obtain sufficient funding or generate sufficient revenue to continue the development of any other product candidate that we may in-license, develop or acquire in the future. Furthermore, even if we obtain regulatory approval for ganaxolone, we will still need to develop a commercial organization, establish commercially viable pricing and obtain adequate reimbursement from third-party and government payers. If we are unable to successfully commercialize ganaxolone, we may not be able to earn sufficient revenue to continue our business.\nBecause the results of preclinical studies or earlier clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, ganaxolone may not have favorable results in later clinical trials or receive regulatory approval.\nSuccess in preclinical studies and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will generate adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of ganaxolone. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including those with greater resources and experience, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after seeing promising results in earlier studies and clinical trials. For example, while ganaxolone\nshowed statistical separation from placebo in a Phase 2 clinical trial in adjunctive treatment of adults with focal onset seizures, ganaxolone failed to show a similar statistically significant separation in a Phase 3 clinical trial for the same indication. As a result, we discontinued our program in adult focal onset seizures and began to focus our efforts on advancing ganaxolone in postpartum depression, refractory status epilepticus, and pediatric orphan epilepsy indications. We do not know whether the clinical trials we may conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety to result in regulatory approval to market ganaxolone in any particular jurisdiction or indication. If clinical trials underway or conducted in the future do not produce favorable results, our ability to achieve regulatory approval for ganaxolone may be adversely impacted. Further, even if we believe the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates are promising, these data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. Pre-clinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways. Accordingly, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities could interpret these data in different ways from us, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.\nThe therapeutic efficacy and safety of ganaxolone are unproven, and we may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize ganaxolone in the future.\nGanaxolone is a novel compound and its potential therapeutic benefit is unproven. Our ability to generate revenue from ganaxolone, which we do not expect will occur for at least the next several years, if ever, will depend on our successful development and commercialization after regulatory approval, which is subject to many potential risks and may not occur. Ganaxolone may interact with human biological systems in unforeseen, ineffective or harmful ways. If ganaxolone is associated with undesirable side effects or has characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon its development or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Many compounds that initially showed promise in early stage testing for treating the target indications for ganaxolone have later been found to cause side effects that prevented further development of the compound. As a result of these and other risks described herein that are inherent in the development of novel therapeutic agents, we may never successfully develop, enter into or maintain third-party licensing or collaboration transactions with respect to, or successfully commercialize, ganaxolone, in which case we will not achieve profitability and the value of our stock may decline.\nClinical development of product candidates involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome.\nClinical trials are expensive, can take many years to complete, and are inherently uncertain as to outcome. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical development process.\nWe may experience delays in our ongoing or future clinical trials and we do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin or enroll patients on time, need to be redesigned or be completed on schedule, if at all. There can be no assurance that the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities will not put clinical trials of ganaxolone on clinical hold now or in the future. Clinical trials may be delayed, suspended or prematurely terminated for a variety of reasons, such as:\n\u00b7\ndelay or failure in reaching agreement with the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority on a trial design that we are able to execute;\n\u00b7\ndelay or failure in obtaining authorization to commence a trial or inability to comply with conditions imposed by a regulatory authority regarding the scope or design of a clinical trial;\n\u00b7\ndelay or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations (CROs) and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u00b7\ndelay or failure in obtaining IRB approval or the approval of other reviewing entities, including comparable foreign regulatory authorities, to conduct a clinical trial at each site;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawal of clinical trial sites from our clinical trials as a result of changing standards of care or the ineligibility of a site to participate in our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\ndelay or failure in recruiting and enrolling suitable trial patients to participate in a trial;\n\u00b7\ndelay or failure in trial patients completing a trial or returning for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u00b7\nclinical sites and investigators deviating from a trial protocol, failing to conduct the trial in accordance with regulatory requirements, or dropping out of a trial;\n\u00b7\ninability to identify and maintain a sufficient number of trial sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial programs, including some that may be for competing product candidates with the same indication;\n\u00b7\nfailure of our third-party clinical trial managers to satisfy their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines;\n\u00b7\ndelay or failure in adding new clinical trial sites;\n\u00b7\nambiguous or negative interim results or results that are inconsistent with earlier results;\n\u00b7\nfeedback from the FDA or a comparable regulatory authority outside the United States, IRBs, or data safety monitoring boards, or results from earlier stage or concurrent preclinical studies and clinical trials, that might require modification to the protocol for the trial;\n\u00b7\ndecision by the FDA or a comparable regulatory authority outside the United States, an IRB or us, or a recommendation by a data safety monitoring board to suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for safety issues or for any other reason;\n\u00b7\nunacceptable risk-benefit profile, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects or AEs associate with a product candidate;\n\u00b7\nfailure of a product candidate to demonstrate any benefit;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in manufacturing or obtaining from third parties sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials that meet internal and regulatory standards;\n\u00b7\nlack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial, including the incurrence of unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional clinical trials or increased expenses associated with the services of our CROs and other third parties;\n\u00b7\npolitical developments that affect our ability to develop and obtain approval for ganaxolone or impair our license rights to develop and obtain approval for ganaxolone in other countries; or\n\u00b7\nchanges in governmental regulations or administrative actions.\nTrial subject enrollment, which significantly impacts the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the subject population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, ability to obtain and maintain patient consents, risk that enrolled patients will drop out before completion, competing clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved or product candidates that may be studied in competing clinical trials for the indications we are investigating. Some of our clinical trials are directed at small patient populations. Patient enrollment in these trials could be particularly challenging. In the past, we have experienced delays in enrolling patients in trials directed at small patient populations. We rely on CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical\ntrials, and while we have agreements governing their committed activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance.\nIf we experience delays in the completion of any clinical trial of ganaxolone, the commercial prospects of ganaxolone may be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenue from ganaxolone, if approved, will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our development and approval process for ganaxolone and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. In addition, many of the factors that could cause a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of ganaxolone.\nGanaxolone may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent its regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following any marketing approval.\nUndesirable side effects caused by ganaxolone could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authority. Although ganaxolone has generally been safe and well-tolerated by patients in our earlier-stage clinical trials, in some cases there were side effects, and some of the side effects were severe. The most frequent side effects were dizziness, fatigue and somnolence (or drowsiness). More side effects of the central nervous system (CNS) were categorized as severe as compared to side effects of other body systems.\nIf these side effects are reported in future clinical trials, or if other safety or toxicity issues are reported in our future clinical trials, we may not receive approval to market ganaxolone, which could prevent us from ever generating revenue or achieving profitability. Furthermore, although we are currently developing ganaxolone for three indications, negative safety findings in any one indication could force us to delay or discontinue development in other indications. Results of our clinical trials could reveal an unacceptably high severity and prevalence of side effects. In such an event, our clinical trials could be suspended or terminated, and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development, or deny approval, of ganaxolone for any or all targeted indications. Drug-related side effects could affect trial subject recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete our future clinical trials and may result in potential product liability claims.\nIn addition, if ganaxolone receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by ganaxolone, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u00b7\nwe may be forced to suspend marketing of ganaxolone;\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approvals of ganaxolone;\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label that could diminish the usage or otherwise limit the commercial success of ganaxolone;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to conduct post-marketing trials;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to develop a REMS for ganaxolone or if a REMS is already in place, to incorporate additional requirements under the REMS, and comparable regulatory authorities outside the United States may require similar risk management strategies;\n\u00b7\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u00b7\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of ganaxolone, if approved.\nEven if ganaxolone receives regulatory approval, we may still face regulatory difficulties.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for ganaxolone, it would be subject to ongoing requirements by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities governing the manufacture, quality control, further development, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, patient registry, import, export, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information. The safety profile of ganaxolone will continue to be closely monitored by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities after approval. If new safety information becomes available after approval of ganaxolone, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require labeling changes or establishment of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) or similar strategy, impose significant restrictions on ganaxolone\u2019s indicated uses or marketing, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval trials or post-market surveillance.\nIn addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) and other regulations. If we or a regulatory authority discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory authority may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. If we, ganaxolone or the manufacturing facilities for ganaxolone fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory authority may, among other things:\n\u00b7\nissue warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u00b7\nmandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners;\n\u00b7\nrequire us to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance;\n\u00b7\nseek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u00b7\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u00b7\nsuspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us;\n\u00b7\nsuspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u00b7\nseize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or require us to initiate a product recall.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit or preclude our ability to commercialize ganaxolone and generate revenue.\nThe FDA\u2019s and other regulatory authorities\u2019 policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval for ganaxolone that we may have obtained, and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdvertising and promotion of ganaxolone, if approved by the FDA, will be heavily scrutinized by, among others, the FDA, the Department of Justice (DOJ), the HHS OIG, state attorneys general, members of Congress and the public. Violations, including promotion of ganaxolone for unapproved or off-label uses, are subject to enforcement letters, inquiries and investigations, and civil and criminal sanctions by the FDA or other government agencies. In addition, advertising and promotion of ganaxolone, if approved outside of the United States, will be heavily scrutinized by comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nIn the United States, promoting ganaxolone for unapproved indications can also subject us to false claims litigation under federal and state statutes, and other litigation and/or investigation, which can lead to civil and criminal penalties and fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which we promote or distribute our drug products. These false claims statutes include the federal False Claims Act, which allows any individual to bring a lawsuit against a pharmaceutical company on behalf of the federal government alleging submission of false or fraudulent claims, or causing to present such false or fraudulent claims, for payment by a federal program such as Medicare or Medicaid. If the government prevails in the lawsuit, the individual will share in any fines or settlement funds. If we do not lawfully promote our approved products, we may become subject to such litigation and/or investigation and, if we are not successful in defending against such actions, those actions could compromise our ability to become profitable.\nIn the EU, strict requirements and restrictions regarding advertising and promotion apply, the details of which may vary per EU Member States. Violation of those rules could subject us to litigation, investigations and/or civil and criminal penalties.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval in international jurisdictions would prevent ganaxolone from being marketed in these jurisdictions.\nIn order to market and sell our products in the EU and many other jurisdictions, we must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, many countries outside the United States require that a product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market. If we are unable to obtain approval of ganaxolone by regulatory authorities in the EU or another country or jurisdiction, the commercial prospects of ganaxolone may be significantly diminished and our business prospects could decline.\nWe may not be able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for ganaxolone or any other product candidates for which we seek it, which could limit the potential profitability of ganaxolone or such other product candidates.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and Europe, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for an indication for which it receives the designation, then the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity that precludes the applicable regulatory authority from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for the exclusivity period except in limited situations. For purposes of small molecule drugs, the FDA defines \u201csame drug\u201d as a drug that contains the same active moiety and is intended for the same use as the drug in question. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation.\nWe have received orphan drug designation for treating SE, CDD, PCDH19-RE, and FXS with ganaxolone and expect that we may in the future pursue orphan drug designations for ganaxolone for one or more additional indications.\nHowever, obtaining an orphan drug designation can be difficult and we may not be successful in doing so for additional ganaxolone indications or any future product candidates. Even if we were to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product candidate, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from the competition of different drugs for the same condition, which could be approved during the exclusivity period. In addition, after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA could subsequently approve another application for the same drug for the same indication if the FDA concludes that the later drug is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States also may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. The failure to obtain an orphan drug designation for any product candidates we may develop, the inability to maintain that designation, or the inability to obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity could reduce our ability to make sufficient sales of the applicable product candidate to balance our expenses incurred to develop it, which would have a negative impact on our operational results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization of Our Product\nOur commercial success depends upon attaining significant market acceptance of ganaxolone, if approved, among physicians, patients, government and private payers and others in the medical community.\nEven if ganaxolone receives regulatory approval, it may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, government and private payers, or others in the medical community. Market acceptance of ganaxolone, if we receive approval, depends on a number of factors, including the:\n\u00b7\nclinically and commercially viable product profile as supported by clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nefficacy and safety of ganaxolone, or ganaxolone administered with other drugs, each as demonstrated in clinical trials and post-marketing experience;\n\u00b7\nclinical indications for which ganaxolone is approved;\n\u00b7\nacceptance by physicians and patients of ganaxolone as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u00b7\npotential and perceived advantages of ganaxolone over alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\nsafety of ganaxolone seen in a broader patient group, including its use outside the approved indications should physicians choose to prescribe for such uses;\n\u00b7\nprevalence and severity of any side effects and drug interactions;\n\u00b7\nproduct labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\ntiming of market introduction of ganaxolone as well as competitive products;\n\u00b7\ncost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\navailability of coverage and adequate reimbursement and pricing by government and private payers;\n\u00b7\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u00b7\neffectiveness of our sales and marketing strategy and efforts;\n\u00b7\nadequate commercial investment; and\n\u00b7\nstability and continuity of product supply chains.\nIf ganaxolone is approved but fails to achieve market acceptance among physicians, patients, government or private payers or others in the medical community, or the products or product candidates that are being administered with ganaxolone are restricted, withdrawn or recalled, or fail to be approved, as the case may be, we may not be able to generate significant revenues, which would compromise our ability to become profitable.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell ganaxolone, we may be unable to generate any revenue.\nWe do not currently have an organization for the sale, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products and the cost of establishing and maintaining such an organization may exceed the cost-effectiveness of doing so. In order to market ganaxolone, if approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, we must build our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. If we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable. We will be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded sales and marketing operations. Without an internal commercial organization or the support of a third party to perform sales and marketing functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies. To the extent we rely on third parties to commercialize ganaxolone, if approved, we may have little or no control over the marketing and sales efforts of such third parties, and our revenues from product sales may be lower than if we had commercialized ganaxolone ourselves.\nEven if we are able to commercialize ganaxolone, it may not receive coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers, which could harm our business.\nOur ability to commercialize ganaxolone successfully will depend, in part, on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for ganaxolone and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, determine which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payers have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payers are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for drugs. Third-party payers may also seek additional clinical evidence, beyond the data required to obtain marketing approval, demonstrating clinical benefits and value in specific patient populations before covering ganaxolone for those patients. We cannot be sure that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be available for ganaxolone and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, ganaxolone, if we obtain marketing approval. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize ganaxolone even if we obtain marketing approval.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may only be temporary. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payers and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payers often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payers for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to ganaxolone and will face competition with respect to any other product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. There are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of the disease indications for which we are developing ganaxolone. Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as, or similar to, our approach, and others are based on entirely different approaches. For example, there are several companies developing product candidates that target the same GABAA, neuroreceptor that we are targeting or that are testing product candidates in the same indications that we are testing. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.\nGanaxolone is presently being developed as an antiepileptic therapeutic. There are a variety of marketed therapies available for these patients.\nSpecifically, there are more than 25 approved AEDs available in the United States and worldwide, including the generic products levetiracetam, lamotrigine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, valproic acid and topiramate. Recent market entrants include branded products developed by Lundbeck, UCB, Eisai, and Sunovion Pharmaceuticals. In addition, there are several drugs in development for the treatment of pediatric orphan indications, including compounds being developed by GW Pharmaceuticals, Zogenix, Zynerba and Ovid Therapeutics. Sage Therapeutics is developing molecules with a similar mechanism of action as ganaxolone for the treatment of PPD.\nMany of the approved drugs are well established therapies or products and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payers. Insurers and other third-party payers may also encourage the use of generic products. These factors may make it difficult for us to achieve market acceptance at desired levels or in a timely manner to ensure viability of our business.\nMore established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their greater size, cash flows and institutional experience. Compared to us, many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources.\nAs a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products before we are able to, which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize ganaxolone. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are safer, more effective, more widely used and cheaper than ours, and may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products. These appreciable advantages could render ganaxolone obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of ganaxolone\u2019s development and commercialization.\nMergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\nIf the market opportunities for ganaxolone are smaller than we believe they are, our results of operations may be adversely affected and our business may suffer.\nWe focus our research and product development on therapeutics to treat patients suffering from rare seizure disorders. Our projections of both the number of people who have these disorders, as well as the subset of people with these diseases who have the potential to benefit from treatment with ganaxolone, are based on estimates. These estimates\nmay prove to be incorrect and new studies or clinical trials may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these disorders. The number of patients in the United States and elsewhere may turn out to be lower than expected, may not be otherwise amenable to treatment with our products, or new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, all of which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business.\nA variety of risks associated with marketing ganaxolone internationally could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe plan to seek regulatory approval for ganaxolone outside of the United States, and, accordingly, we expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries if we obtain the necessary approvals, including:\n\u00b7\ndiffering regulatory requirements in foreign countries;\n\u00b7\nthe potential for so-called parallel importing, which is what happens when a local seller, faced with high or higher local prices, opts to import goods from a foreign market (with low or lower prices) rather than buying them locally;\n\u00b7\nviable pricing awarded in international markets to support commercial investment is required;\n\u00b7\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u00b7\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u00b7\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u00b7\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u00b7\nchallenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;\n\u00b7\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u00b7\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism.\nThese and other risks associated with our international operations may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or maintain profitable operations.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of ganaxolone or other product candidates that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of ganaxolone by us or our investigators in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if ganaxolone receives regulatory approval and\nwe subsequently commercialize it. Product liability claims may be brought against us by subjects enrolled in our clinical trials, patients, healthcare providers or others using, administering or selling ganaxolone. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that ganaxolone caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in, for example:\n\u00b7\ndecreased demand for ganaxolone;\n\u00b7\ntermination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n\u00b7\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawal of clinical trial patients;\n\u00b7\nsignificant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u00b7\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients;\n\u00b7\nloss of revenue;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to commercialize ganaxolone; and\n\u00b7\nincreased scrutiny and potential investigation by, among others, the FDA, the DOJ, the HHS OIG, state attorneys general, members of Congress and the public.\nWe currently have product liability insurance coverage, which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. We intend to expand our product liability insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for ganaxolone, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for ganaxolone, if approved for marketing. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us, particularly if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize ganaxolone.\nWe rely on third-party CROs to monitor and manage data for our ongoing preclinical and clinical programs. We rely on these parties for execution of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and we control only some aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and clinical trials are conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory and scientific requirements and standards, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We also rely on third parties to assist in conducting our preclinical studies in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) and the Animal Welfare Act requirements, where applicable. We and our CROs are required to comply with federal regulations and Good Clinical Practices (GCP), which are international requirements meant to protect the rights and health of patients that are enforced by the FDA, the competent authorities of the EU Member States and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for ganaxolone and any future product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce GCP through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCP, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable\nforeign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP requirements. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP requirements. Failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nOur CROs are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing clinical, nonclinical and preclinical programs. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our preclinical studies and clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize ganaxolone. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for ganaxolone would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.\nBecause we have relied on third parties, our internal capacity to perform these functions is limited. Outsourcing these functions involves risk that third parties may not perform to our standards, may not produce results in a timely manner or may fail to perform at all. In addition, the use of third-party service providers requires us to disclose our proprietary information to these parties, which could increase the risk that this information will be misappropriated. We currently have a small number of employees, which limits the internal resources we have available to identify and monitor our third-party providers. To the extent we are unable to identify and successfully manage the performance of third-party service providers in the future, our business may be adversely affected. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nIf we lose our relationships with CROs, our drug development efforts could be delayed.\nWe rely on third-party vendors and CROs for preclinical studies and clinical trials related to our drug development efforts. Switching or adding additional CROs would involve additional cost and requires management time and focus. Our CROs generally have the right to terminate their agreements with us in the event of an uncured material breach. In addition, some of our CROs have an ability to terminate their respective agreements with us, or research projects pursuant to such agreements, if, in the reasonable opinion of the relevant CRO, the safety of the patients participating in our clinical trials warrants such termination. These agreements or research projects may also be terminated if we make a general assignment for the benefit of our creditors or if we are liquidated. Identifying, qualifying and managing performance of third-party service providers can be difficult, time consuming and cause delays in our development programs. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work and the new CRO may not provide the same type or level of services as the original provider. If any of our relationships with our third-party CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or to do so on commercially reasonable terms.\nOur experience manufacturing ganaxolone is limited to the needs of our preclinical studies and clinical trials. We have no experience manufacturing ganaxolone on a commercial scale and have no manufacturing facility. We are dependent on third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of ganaxolone as well as on third parties for our supply chain, and if we experience problems with any such third parties, the manufacturing of ganaxolone could be delayed.\nWe do not own or operate facilities for the manufacture of ganaxolone. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. We currently rely on CMOs for the chemical manufacture of raw materials and active pharmaceutical ingredients for ganaxolone and other CMOs for the production of the ganaxolone nanoparticulate formulation into capsules, liquid suspension and IV. To meet our projected needs for preclinical and clinical supplies to support our activities through regulatory approval and commercial manufacturing, the CMOs with whom we currently work will need to increase the scale of production. We may need to identify additional CMOs for continued production of supply for ganaxolone. Although alternative third-party suppliers with the necessary manufacturing and regulatory expertise and facilities exist, it could be expensive and take a significant amount of time to\narrange for alternative suppliers. If we are unable to arrange for alternative third-party manufacturing sources on commercially reasonable terms, in a timely manner or at all, we may not be able to complete development of ganaxolone, or market or distribute ganaxolone.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured ganaxolone ourselves, including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, the possibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control, including a failure to synthesize and manufacture ganaxolone or any products we may eventually commercialize in accordance with our specifications, and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or damaging to us. In addition, the FDA and other regulatory authorities will require that ganaxolone and any products that we may eventually commercialize be manufactured according to cGMP and similar foreign standards. Any failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with cGMP or failure to scale up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities of ganaxolone in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval of ganaxolone. In addition, such failure could be the basis for the FDA to issue a warning letter, withdraw approvals for ganaxolone previously granted to us, or take other regulatory or legal action, including recall or seizure of outside supplies of ganaxolone, total or partial suspension of production, suspension of ongoing clinical trials, refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, detention of product, refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunction, or imposing civil and criminal penalties.\nAny significant disruption in our supplier relationships could harm our business. Any significant delay in the supply of ganaxolone or its key materials for an ongoing preclinical study or clinical trial could considerably delay completion of our preclinical study or clinical trial, product testing and potential regulatory approval of ganaxolone. If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these key materials after regulatory approval has been obtained for ganaxolone, the commercial launch of ganaxolone would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of ganaxolone.\nWe may elect to enter into license or collaboration agreements to partner ganaxolone in territories currently retained by us. Our dependence on such relationships may adversely affect our business.\nBecause we have limited resources, we may seek to enter into license or collaboration agreements with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. Any failure by our partners to perform their obligations or any decision by our partners to terminate these agreements could negatively impact our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize ganaxolone. In the event we grant exclusive rights to such partners, we would be precluded from potential commercialization of ganaxolone within the territories in which we have a partner. In addition, any termination of our license or collaboration agreements will terminate the funding we may receive under the relevant license or collaboration agreement and may impair our ability to fund further development efforts and our progress in our development programs.\nOur commercialization strategy for ganaxolone may depend on our ability to enter into agreements with partners to obtain assistance and funding for the development and potential commercialization of ganaxolone in the territories in which we seek to partner. Despite our efforts, we may be unable to secure license or collaboration agreements or other arrangements that are necessary for us to further develop and commercialize ganaxolone. Supporting diligence activities conducted by potential collaborators and negotiating the financial and other terms of a license or collaboration agreement are long and complex processes with uncertain results. Even if we are successful in entering into one or more license or collaboration agreements, such agreements may involve greater uncertainty for us, as we would have less control over certain aspects of our partnered programs than we do over our un-partnered programs. We may determine that continuing a license or collaboration under the terms provided is not in our best interest, and we may terminate the license or collaboration. Our potential future partners could delay or terminate their agreements, and as a result ganaxolone may never be successfully commercialized.\nFurther, our potential future partners may develop alternative products or pursue alternative technologies either on their own or in collaboration with others, including our competitors, and the priorities or focus of our partners may shift such that ganaxolone receives less attention or resources than we would like, or they may be terminated altogether.\nAny such actions by our potential future partners may adversely affect our business prospects and ability to earn revenue. In addition, we could have disputes with our potential future partners, such as the interpretation of terms in our agreements. Any such disagreements could lead to delays in the development or commercialization of ganaxolone or could result in time-consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration, which may not be resolved in our favor.\nGovernment funding for certain of our programs adds uncertainty to our research efforts with respect to those programs and may impose requirements that increase the costs of commercialization and production of product candidates developed under those government-funded programs.\nOur preclinical studies and clinical trials to evaluate ganaxolone in FXS patients have been conducted with the MIND Institute at the University of California, Davis which receive funding from the United States Department of Defense (DoD) for such studies and clinical trials. In addition, our preclinical studies and clinical trials to evaluate ganaxolone in patients suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been primarily conducted by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, which also receives funding from the DoD. Programs funded by the United States government and its agencies, including the DoD, include provisions that confer on the government substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including powers of the government to:\n\u00b7\nterminate agreements, in whole or in part, for any reason or no reason;\n\u00b7\nreduce or modify the government\u2019s obligations under such agreements without the consent of the other party;\n\u00b7\nclaim rights, including intellectual property rights, in products and data developed under such agreements;\n\u00b7\naudit contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs;\n\u00b7\nsuspend the contractor from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations;\n\u00b7\nimpose United States manufacturing requirements for products that embody inventions conceived or first reduced to practice under such agreements;\n\u00b7\nsuspend or debar the contractor from doing future business with the government; and\n\u00b7\ncontrol and potentially prohibit the export of products.\nWe may not have the right to prohibit the United States government from using or allowing others to use certain technologies developed by us, and we may not be able to prohibit third-party companies, including our competitors, from using those technologies in providing products and services to the United States government. The United States government generally obtains the right to royalty-free use of technologies that are developed under United States government contracts.\nIn addition, government contracts normally contain additional requirements that may increase our costs of doing business, reduce our profits, and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions. These requirements include, for example:\n\u00b7\nspecialized accounting systems unique to government contracts;\n\u00b7\nmandatory financial audits and potential liability for price adjustments or recoupment of government funds after such funds have been spent;\n\u00b7\npublic disclosures of certain contract information, which may enable competitors to gain insights into our research program; and\n\u00b7\nmandatory socioeconomic compliance requirements, including labor standards, non-discrimination and affirmative action programs and environmental compliance requirements.\nIf we fail to maintain compliance with these requirements, we may be subject to potential contract liability and to termination of our contracts.\nChanges in government budgets and agendas may result in a decreased and de-prioritized emphasis on supporting the development of ganaxolone in patients suffering from certain FXS-associated behavioral symptoms. Any reduction or delay in DoD funding to our collaborators may force us to seek alternative funding in order to progress these programs, which may not be available on non-dilutive terms, terms favorable to us or at all.\nIf our third-party manufacturers use hazardous and biological materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for damages.\nOur research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including chemical and biological materials by our third-party manufacturers. Our manufacturers are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations in the United States governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of medical, radioactive and hazardous materials. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from medical, radioactive or hazardous materials. As a result of any such contamination or injury we may incur liability or local, city, state or federal authorities may curtail the use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines, and the liability could exceed our resources. We do not have any insurance for liabilities arising from medical radioactive or hazardous materials. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Compliance\nRecently enacted and future legislation, including potentially unfavorable pricing regulations or other healthcare reform initiatives, may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize ganaxolone and affect the prices we may obtain.\nThe regulations that govern, among other things, marketing approvals, coverage, pricing and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of ganaxolone, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to successfully sell ganaxolone, if we obtain marketing approval.\nIn the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Medicare Modernization Act) changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by eligible beneficiaries and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician administered drugs. In recent years, Congress has considered further reductions in Medicare reimbursement for drugs administered by physicians. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the agency that runs the Medicare program, also has the authority to revise reimbursement rates and to implement coverage restrictions for some drugs. Cost reduction initiatives and changes in coverage implemented through legislation or regulation could decrease utilization of and reimbursement for any approved products, which in turn would affect the price we can receive for those products. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our drugs. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare\nproducts and services, which could result in reduced demand for ganaxolone, if approved, or additional pricing pressures.\nThe Affordable Care Act is intended to reduce the cost of, improve the quality of, and expand access to healthcare, among other things. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act expanded manufacturers\u2019 rebate liability to include covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, increased the minimum rebate due for innovator drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price (AMP) to 23.1% of AMP and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100.0% of AMP. The Affordable Care Act and subsequent legislation also changed the definition of AMP. Furthermore, the Affordable Care Act imposed a significant annual, nondeductible fee on companies that manufacture or import certain branded prescription drug products. Certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act have been subject to judicial challenges as well as efforts to repeal or replace them or to alter their interpretation and implementation. Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes, and judicial challenges related to the Affordable Care Act remain possible, but the nature and extent of such potential changes or challenges are uncertain at this time. The implications of the Affordable Care Act, and efforts to repeal, and replace, or invalidate, the Affordable Care Act or its implementing regulations, or portions thereof, or the political uncertainty surrounding any repeal or replacement legislation for our business and financial condition, if any, are not yet clear. We will continue to evaluate the effect that the Affordable Care Act as well as its possible repeal, replacement, or invalidation, in whole or in part, has on our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of an amount greater than $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to healthcare providers of, on average, 2.0% per fiscal year, starting in 2013 and continuing through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several categories of healthcare providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. If we ever obtain regulatory approval and commercialization of ganaxolone, these laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations.\nIn addition, legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of ganaxolone may be.\nIn the United States, the EU and other potentially significant markets for ganaxolone, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which has resulted in lower average selling prices. Furthermore, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the EU will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general.\nSome countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for ganaxolone in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, which could negatively impact the revenue we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that particular country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in ganaxolone even if ganaxolone obtains marketing approval.\nIf we participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under that program or other governmental pricing programs that we participate in, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe expect to participate in and have certain price reporting obligations to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, if we successfully commercialize one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, we would be required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for our drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Those rebates are based on pricing data we would have to report on a monthly and quarterly basis to the CMS, the federal agency that administers the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. These data include the average manufacturer price and, in the case of innovator products, the best price for each drug which, in general, represents the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any entity in the United States in any pricing structure, calculated to include all sales and associated rebates, discounts and other price concessions. Our failure to comply with these price reporting and rebate payment obligations if we participate in the program could negatively impact our financial results.\nFederal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program also participate in the 340B program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer\u2019s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program, which is administered by the HRSA, requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B \u201cceiling price\u201d for the manufacturer\u2019s covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The Affordable Care Act expanded the list of covered entities to include certain free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals, but exempts \u201corphan drugs\u201d from the ceiling price requirements for these covered entities. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula based on the average manufacturer price and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, and in general, products subject to Medicaid price reporting and rebate liability are also subject to the 340B ceiling price calculation and discount requirement. Any additional future changes to the definition of average manufacturer price and the Medicaid rebate amount under the Affordable Care Act or other legislation or regulation could affect our 340B ceiling price calculations and negatively impact our results of operations if we successfully commercialize one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval. In addition, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, would further expand the 340B program to additional covered entities or would require participating manufacturers to agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs used in an inpatient setting.\nFederal law also requires that a company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program report average sales price information each quarter to CMS for certain categories of drugs that are paid under the Medicare Part B program. Manufacturers calculate the average sales price based on a statutorily defined formula as well as regulations and interpretations of the statute by CMS. CMS uses these submissions to determine payment rates for drugs under Medicare Part B.\nPricing and rebate calculations vary among products and programs. The calculations are complex and are often subject to interpretation by the manufacturer, governmental or regulatory agencies, and the courts. If we participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and consequently the 340B program, we could be held liable for errors associated with our submission of pricing data. In addition to retroactive Medicaid rebates and the potential for 340B program refunds, if we are found to have knowingly submitted false average manufacturer price or best price information to the government, we may be liable for significant civil monetary penalties per item of false information. If we are found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of our average sales price, the Medicare statute provides for significant civil monetary penalties for each misrepresentation for each day in which the misrepresentation was applied. Civil monetary penalties can also be applied if we are found to have charged 340B covered entities more than the statutorily mandated ceiling price. Our failure to submit monthly/quarterly average manufacturer price and best price data on a timely basis could result in a significant civil monetary penalty per day for each day the information is late beyond the due date. Such failure also could be grounds for CMS to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, pursuant to which we would be participating in the\nMedicaid program. In the event that CMS terminates our rebate agreement, no federal payments would be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs.\nCMS and the Department of Health & Human Services Office of Inspector General have pursued manufacturers that were alleged to have failed to report these data to the government in a timely manner. Governmental agencies may also make changes in program interpretations, requirements or conditions of participation, some of which may have implications for amounts previously estimated or paid. If we participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and consequently the 340B program, we cannot assure you that our submissions will not be found to be incomplete or incorrect.\nIn order to be eligible to have our products that we successfully commercialize paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, we also would have to participate in the VA FSS pricing program. As part of this program, we would be obligated to make our products available for procurement on an FSS contract under which we must comply with standard government terms and conditions and charge a price that is no higher than the statutory FCP to four federal agencies (VA, U.S. DOD, Public Health Service, and U.S. Coast Guard).\nThe FCP is based on the Non-FAMP, which we would be required to calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. Pursuant to applicable law, knowing provision of false information in connection with a Non-FAMP filing can subject a manufacturer to significant civil monetary penalties for each item of false information. The FSS pricing and contracting obligations also contain extensive disclosure and certification requirements.\nIf we successfully commercialize one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, we also would participate in the Tricare Retail Pharmacy program, under which we would be required to pay quarterly rebates on utilization of innovator products that are dispensed through the Tricare Retail Pharmacy network to Tricare beneficiaries. The rebates are calculated as the difference between the annual Non-FAMP and FCP. We would be required to list our innovator products on a Tricare Agreement in order for them to be eligible for DOD formulary inclusion. If we overcharge the government in connection with our FSS contract or Tricare Agreement, whether due to a misstated FCP or otherwise, we would be required to refund the difference to the government. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges could result in allegations against us under the False Claims Act and other laws and regulations. Unexpected refunds to the government, and responding to a government investigation or enforcement action, would be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects\nLaws and regulations governing international operations may preclude us from developing, manufacturing and selling product candidates outside of the United States and require us to develop and implement costly compliance programs.\nAs we seek to expand our operations outside of the United States, we must comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate. The creation and implementation of international business practices compliance programs is costly and such programs are difficult to enforce, particularly where reliance on third parties is required.\nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits any United States individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring such companies to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. The anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA are enforced primarily by the DOJ. The SEC is involved with enforcement of the books and records provisions of the FCPA.\nCompliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in\nmany countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.\nVarious laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain foreign nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. Our expanding presence outside of the United States will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling ganaxolone outside of the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.\nThe failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial penalties, including suspension or debarment from government contracting. Violation of the FCPA can result in significant civil and criminal penalties. Indictment alone under the FCPA can lead to suspension of the right to do business with the United States government until the pending claims are resolved. Conviction of a violation of the FCPA can result in long-term disqualification as a government contractor. The termination of a government contract or relationship as a result of our failure to satisfy any of our obligations under laws governing international business practices would have a negative impact on our operations and harm our reputation and ability to procure government contracts. The SEC also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on United States exchanges for violations of the FCPA\u2019s accounting provisions.\nOur relationships with customers and third-party payers will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and others will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with healthcare professionals, third-party payers, patients and others will expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims, and other healthcare laws and regulations that may affect the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we would market, sell and distribute our products. Even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights are and will be applicable to our business. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our operations (including our marketing, promotion, educational programs, pricing, and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities, among other things) and expose us to areas of risk including the following:\n\u00b7\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of, any healthcare item or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare & Medicaid;\n\u00b7\nthe federal civil False Claims Act prohibits individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government, or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u00b7\nother federal false claims laws, including, among others, federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non-government health benefit programs;\n\u00b7\nHIPAA imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and also prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying,\nconcealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n\u00b7\nHIPAA also imposes obligations on certain covered entity health care providers, health plans and health care clearinghouses as well as their business associates that perform services on behalf of the covered entity involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, to report annually to CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, and teaching hospitals, and starting in 2022 certain other health care professionals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations; and\n\u00b7\nanalogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payers, including private insurers, as well as other state laws and regulations governing pharmaceutical manufacturers; and\n\u00b7\nstate and foreign laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. For a fuller discussion of the applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency, and other healthcare laws and regulations applicable to our business, see Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements.\u201d\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties are compliant with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve the expenditure of appropriate, and possibly significant, resources. Nonetheless, it is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare & Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to not be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or if our intellectual property rights are inadequate for our technology and product candidates, our competitive position could be harmed.\nOur commercial success will depend in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our technology and products. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, and confidentiality, licensing and other agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and products that are important to our business.\nThe patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally are highly uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions and have in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patents, including those patent rights licensed to us by third parties, are highly uncertain. The steps we or our licensors have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not\nbe adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, both inside and outside the United States. Further, the examination process may require us or our licensors to narrow the claims for our pending patent applications, which may limit the scope of patent protection that may be obtained if these applications issue. The rights already granted under any of our currently issued patents or those licensed to us and those that may be granted under future issued patents may not provide us with the protection or competitive advantages we are seeking. If we or our licensors are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficient, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or superior to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected. It is also possible that we or our licensors will fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of our development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them.\nWith respect to patent rights, we do not know whether any of our granted or issued patents will effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all, until they are issued as a patent. Therefore we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions.\nOur pending applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications. Because the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, issued patents that we own or have licensed from third parties may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in the loss of patent protection, the narrowing of claims in such patents or the invalidity or unenforceability of such patents, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection for our technology and products. Protecting against the unauthorized use of our or our licensors\u2019 patented technology, trademarks and other intellectual property rights is expensive, difficult and may in some cases not be possible. In some cases, it may be difficult or impossible to detect third-party infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, even in relation to issued patent claims, and proving any such infringement may be even more difficult.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of our own intellectual property rights or the proprietary rights of others. Also, third parties may initiate legal proceedings against us to challenge the validity or scope of intellectual property rights we own or control. These proceedings can be expensive and time consuming. Many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to defend their intellectual property rights than we can. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, which could harm our business and financial results. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent owned or controlled by us is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of shares of our common stock.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could harm our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell ganaxolone, if approved, and to use our related technologies. We may become party to, or threatened with, adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to ganaxolone, including interference or derivation proceedings before the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. If we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue commercializing ganaxolone. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Under certain circumstances, we could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing ganaxolone. In addition, in any such proceeding or litigation, we could be found liable for monetary damages. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing ganaxolone or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Any claims by third parties that we have misappropriated their confidential information or trade secrets could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nWhile ganaxolone is in preclinical studies and clinical trials, we believe that the use of ganaxolone in these preclinical studies and clinical trials falls within the scope of the exemptions provided by 35 U.S.C. Section 271(e) in the United States, which exempts from patent infringement liability activities reasonably related to the development and submission of information to the FDA. As ganaxolone progresses toward commercialization, the possibility of a patent infringement claim against us increases. While ganaxolone itself is off patent, we attempt to ensure that our solid and liquid nanoparticulate formulation of ganaxolone and the methods we employ to manufacture ganaxolone do not infringe other parties\u2019 patents and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance they do not, however, and competitors or other parties may assert that we infringe their proprietary rights in any event.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on ganaxolone and any future product candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our or our licensors\u2019 intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws and practices of some foreign countries, particularly those relating to pharmaceuticals, do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. For example, novel formulations and manufacturing processes may not be patentable in certain jurisdictions, and the requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries. Furthermore, generic drug manufacturers or other competitors may challenge the scope, validity or enforceability of our patents, requiring us to engage in complex, lengthy and costly litigation or other proceedings. Generic drug manufacturers may develop, seek approval for, and launch generic versions of our products. Many countries, including EU countries, India, Japan and China, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled under certain circumstances to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if we are compelled to grant a license to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of our patents. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from our intellectual property.\nWe may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions into or within the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products, and may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing with us in these jurisdictions.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being\ninvalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our products for an adequate amount of time.\nGiven the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, such as ganaxolone, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. We expect to seek extensions of patent terms in the United States and, if available, in other countries where we are prosecuting patents. In the United States, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 permits under certain circumstances a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the normal expiration of a patent. However, the applicable authorities, including the FDA and the USPTO in the United States, and any analogous regulatory authority in other countries, may not agree with our assessment of whether such extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents, or may grant more limited extensions than we request. If this occurs, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our investment in development and clinical trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case.\nChanges in patent laws could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nAs is the case with other pharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the pharmaceutical industry involve technological and legal complexity, and obtaining and enforcing pharmaceutical patents is costly, time-consuming, and inherently uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. For example, the United States Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce existing patents and patents we may obtain in the future. Recent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nIn addition, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (Leahy-Smith Act) includes a number of provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. In particular, under the Leahy-Smith Act, the United States transitioned to a \u201cfirst to file\u201d system in which the first inventor to file a patent application is entitled to the patent. Third parties are allowed to submit prior art before the issuance of a patent by the USPTO and may become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter-parties review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of our licensors. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate patent rights, which could adversely affect our competitive position.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submissions, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited\nto, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or our licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product candidates, our competitive position would be adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nSome of our employees were previously employed at universities or at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Some of these employees, including each member of our senior management, executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements, or similar agreements, in connection with such previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such third party. Litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel or sustain damages. Such intellectual property rights could be awarded to a third party, and we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to commercialize our technology or products. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u00b7\nothers may be able to make compounds or ganaxolone formulations that are similar to our ganaxolone formulations but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or control;\n\u00b7\nwe or any strategic partners might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patents or pending patent applications that we own or control;\n\u00b7\nwe might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u00b7\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nit is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n\u00b7\nissued patents that we own or control may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges;\n\u00b7\nour competitors might conduct research and development activities in the United States and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for certain research and development activities, as well as in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u00b7\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and\n\u00b7\nthe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to our Business Operations\nWe are dependent on our executives and other key professionals and the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business.\nWe are dependent on the efforts of our executives and other key scientific, manufacturing and quality personnel. The loss of any of these individuals, or our inability to recruit and train additional key personnel in a timely manner, could materially and adversely affect our business and our future prospects. A loss of one or more of our current executives or other key professionals could severely and negatively impact our operations. All of our employees, including our chief executive officer, are employed \u201cat-will,\u201d and any of them may elect to pursue other opportunities at any time. We have no present intention of obtaining key man life insurance on any of our executive officers or key professionals.\nWe will need to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had 40 full-time and three part-time employees. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, or as a result of any future acquisitions, we will need additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other resources. In addition, it may become more cost effective to bring in house certain resources currently outsourced to consultants and other third-parties. Our management, personnel and systems currently in place may not be adequate to support our future growth. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including:\n\u00b7\nmanaging our clinical trials effectively;\n\u00b7\nidentifying, recruiting, maintaining, motivating and integrating additional employees;\n\u00b7\nmanaging our internal development efforts effectively while complying with our contractual obligations to licensors, licensees, contractors and other third parties;\n\u00b7\nimproving our managerial, development, operational and finance systems; and\n\u00b7\nexpanding our facilities.\nAs our operations expand, we will need to manage additional relationships with various strategic partners, suppliers and other third parties. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize ganaxolone, if approved, and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to manage our development efforts and clinical trials effectively and hire, train and integrate additional management, administrative and sales and marketing personnel. Our failure to accomplish any of these tasks could prevent us from successfully growing our company.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain highly qualified employees, and other personnel, advisors and consultants with scientific, technical and managerial expertise, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nOur future growth and success depend on our ability to recruit, retain, manage and motivate our employees, consultants and other third-parties. The loss of any member of our senior management team or the inability to hire or retain experienced management personnel could compromise our ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results.\nBecause of the specialized scientific and managerial nature of our business, we rely heavily on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel, advisors and consultants. The competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical field is significant and, as a result, we may be unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business.\nWe may acquire other assets or businesses, or form collaborations or make investments in other companies or technologies that could harm our operating results, dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of assets, including preclinical, clinical or commercial stage products or product candidates, or businesses, or strategic alliances and collaborations, to expand our existing technologies and operations. We may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction, any of which could have a detrimental effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have no experience with acquiring other companies, products or product candidates, and limited experience with forming strategic alliances and collaborations. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and if we make any acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into our existing business and we may incur additional debt or assume unknown or contingent liabilities in connection therewith. Integration of an acquired company or assets may also disrupt ongoing operations, require the hiring of additional personnel and the implementation of additional internal systems and infrastructure, especially the acquisition of commercial assets, and require management resources that would otherwise focus on developing our existing business. We may not be able to find suitable strategic alliance or collaboration partners or identify other investment opportunities, and we may experience losses related to any such investments.\nTo finance any acquisitions or collaborations, we may choose to issue debt or equity securities as consideration. Any such issuance of shares would dilute the ownership of our stockholders. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other assets or companies or fund a transaction using our stock as consideration. Alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds for acquisitions through public or private financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\nOur employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, CMOs, consultants and collaboration partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, third-party CROs and CMOs, consultants and collaboration partners may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or unauthorized activities that violate regulations of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such authorities; manufacturing standards; federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations; or laws that require the reporting of true and accurate financial information and data. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. These activities also include the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyberattacks or a deficiency in our cybersecurity or those of any business partners.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of our CROs and other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural\ndisasters, fire, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures, cyberattacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, loss of funds or information from phishing or other fraudulent schemes, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization or those with whom we do business. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Such an event could cause interruption of our operations or loss of Company funds and have a negative financial consequence on our business. In addition, our systems safeguard important confidential personal data regarding patients enrolled in our clinical trials. If a disruption event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs. For example, the loss of data relating to completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and cause us to incur significant additional costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, misappropriation of funds to unintended recipients, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential, proprietary or personal information, we could incur material legal claims and liabilities and damage to our reputation and the further development of ganaxolone could be delayed. Additionally, breach remediation costs may be significant.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or man-made disasters or business interruptions, for which we are predominantly self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce ganaxolone. Our ability to obtain clinical supplies of ganaxolone could be disrupted if the operations of these suppliers are affected by a man-made or natural disaster or other business interruption. In addition, while we believe that we currently have sufficient supply of our product candidates to continue our ongoing clinical trials, some of our product candidates, or materials contained therein, come from facilities located in areas impacted by the coronavirus (COVID-19), such as Asia. There is no guarantee that the recent coronavirus outbreak, or any potential future outbreak, would not materially impact our future supply chain. The ultimate impact on us, our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being in certain geographical areas is unknown, but our operations and financial condition could suffer in the event of a major earthquake, fire or other natural disaster.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our stock is highly volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our common stock is highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, these factors include:\n\u00b7\nthe success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u00b7\nregulatory actions with respect to our products or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u00b7\nresults of clinical trials of ganaxolone or product candidates of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nregulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe level of expenses related to our clinical development programs;\n\u00b7\nthe results of our efforts to in-license or acquire additional product candidates or products;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u00b7\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u00b7\nannouncement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u00b7\nsales of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u00b7\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u00b7\nother events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, the Nasdaq Global Market and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The realization of any of these risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in these \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert our management\u2019s attention.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, and in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nInsiders have substantial influence over us and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control.\nWe estimate that our executive officers, directors and holders of 5% or more of our capital stock collectively beneficially own approximately 42.4% of our voting stock. Upon conversion of all of our outstanding convertible preferred stock, as of March 12, 2020, our executive officers, directors and holders of 5% or more of our capital stock collectively would beneficially own approximately 33.6% of our voting stock. This concentration of ownership could harm the market price of our common stock by:\n\u00b7\ndelaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company;\n\u00b7\nimpeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving our company; or\n\u00b7\ndiscouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.\nThe interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, including seeking a premium value for their common stock, and might negatively affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future, which may cause our results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts, stockholders and investors.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7\nthe timing, implementation and cost of our research, preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nour ability to attract and retain personnel with the necessary strategic, technical and creative skills required for effective operations;\n\u00b7\nintroduction of new technologies;\n\u00b7\nproduct liability litigation, class action and derivative action litigation, or other litigation;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of capital expenditures and other costs relating to the expansion of our operations;\n\u00b7\nthe state of the debt and/or equity capital markets at the time of any proposed offering we choose to initiate;\n\u00b7\nour ability to successfully integrate new acquisitions into our operations;\n\u00b7\ngovernment regulation and legal developments regarding ganaxolone in the United States and in the foreign countries in which we may operate in the future; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions.\nAs a strategic response to changes in the competitive environment, we may from time to time make pricing, service, technology or marketing decisions or business or technology acquisitions that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Due to any of these factors, our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts, stockholders and investors in any future period, which may cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nIf our stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. As of March 12, 2020, we had outstanding a total of 86,711,035 shares of common stock and 30,000 shares of Series A Participating Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (Series A Preferred Stock). Subject to shareholder approval to increase our authorized common stock, the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock would be convertible into 24,000,00 shares of common stock as of March 12, 2020, subject to certain ownership limitations. In addition, shares of common stock that are either subject to outstanding options or reserved for future issuance under our employee benefit plans or otherwise will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting schedules and either the registration of such shares under the Securities Act or the application of exemptions from such registration with respect to any sales such as\nRule 144 under the Securities Act. If these additional shares of common stock are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nHolders of our outstanding preferred shares have liquidation and other rights that are senior to the rights of the holders of shares of our common stock.\nIn the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company whether voluntary or involuntary (each, a Liquidation), the holders of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to have set apart for them, or to be paid, out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to stockholders (whether such assets are capital, surplus or earnings) after provision for payment of all debts and liabilities of the Company in accordance with the DGCL, before any distribution or payment is made with respect to any shares of junior securities, including shares of our common stock, and subject to the liquidation rights and preferences of any class or series of senior securities and parity securities, an amount equal to the greater of (i) $1,000, being the purchase price per share of Series A Preferred Stock (which amount shall be subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments) plus all accrued but unpaid dividends thereon and (ii) such amount as would have been payable on the number of shares of common stock into which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such Liquidation. The liquidation preference terminates upon the effectiveness of the registration statement covering the resale of the shares of common stock into which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are convertible under the Securities Act. If applicable, this liquidation preference will reduce the amount of our assets, if any, available to distribute to holders of our common stock.\nOur common stock is subject to substantial dilution and we are requesting our stockholders\u2019 approval to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock and to approve a discretionary reverse split of our common stock.\nAs of March 12, 2020, we were authorized to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, 86,711,035 of which were issued and outstanding, 11,850,845 of which were reserved for issuance under our equity compensation plans, and 1,164,500 of which were reserved for issuance under option awards granted outside of our equity compensation plans. Accordingly, as of March 12, 2020, there were 273,620 shares of our common stock available for all other corporate purposes, such as additional capital raising activities. In addition to our authorized shares of common stock, we are authorized to issue up to 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, in one or more series designated by our board of directors, of which 30,000 shares have been designated as Series A Preferred Stock, and are currently issued and outstanding. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock will be convertible from and after we file an amendment to our Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (Certificate of Incorporation) to increase our authorized shares of common stock (Authorized Shares Amendment). As of March 12, 2020, the Series A Preferred Stock will be convertible into an aggregate of 24,000,000 shares of common stock after filing of the Authorized Shares Amendment.\nOn March 31, 2020, we intend to hold a special meeting of stockholders pursuant to a proxy statement filed with the SEC on March 2, 2020 to, among other things, obtain stockholder approval to increase the number of shares of our authorized common stock from 100,000,000 to 150,000,000 shares and to authorize our board of directors to approve an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of all the outstanding shares of our common stock at a ratio of 1-for-4 (Reverse Split Amendment), and to grant authorization to our board of directors to determine, in its discretion, the timing of the reverse stock split any time before March 31, 2021, subject to our board of directors\u2019 discretion to abandon such Reverse Split Amendment.\nOur existing stockholders will not suffer any immediate dilution in voting rights and in ownership interests upon the authorization of additional shares of common stock. However, upon filing of the Authorized Shares Amendment, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock will have the right, at any time thereafter, to convert such shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock subject to certain mandatory conversion requirements and other limitations set forth in the Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of Series A Participating Convertible Preferred Stock. If such shares of common stock are issued upon this conversion, existing stockholders will suffer dilution in voting rights and ownership interests upon such issuance. Further, if we issue additional shares of our common stock in future actions that we may deem desirable or necessary to accomplish our business objectives, our\nexisting stockholders could suffer further dilutive consequences. Any sale of our common stock into the public market could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFurther, because implementation of the Reverse Split Amendment would not change the total number of shares of our common stock authorized for issuance, the number of shares of our common stock available for issuance following the implementation of the Reverse Split Amendment would increase to the extent the Reverse Stock Amendment reduces the number of outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly, the Reverse Stock Amendment would provide us with additional authorized, unissued and otherwise unreserved shares of common stock available for future corporate purposes, including future acquisitions, investment opportunities, the establishment of collaboration or other strategic agreements, capital raising transactions involving equity or convertible debt securities, future at the market offerings of common stock, or issuance under current or future employee equity plans. The issuance of equity securities in connection with such transactions may result in potentially significant dilution of our current stockholders\u2019 ownership interests in the Company.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, or remove our current management. These include provisions that:\n\u00b7\npermit our board of directors to issue up to 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as it may designate, of which 30,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding;\n\u00b7\nprovide that all vacancies on our board of directors, including as a result of newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n\u00b7\nestablish a classified board of directors such that only one of three classes of directors is elected each year;\n\u00b7\nprovide that directors can only be removed for cause;\n\u00b7\nrequire that any action to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and not be taken by written consent;\n\u00b7\nprovide that stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of stockholders must provide advance notice in writing, and also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder\u2019s notice;\n\u00b7\nnot provide for cumulative voting rights, thereby allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election; and\n\u00b7\nprovide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairperson of the board of directors, the chief executive officer or the board of directors.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management. Because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15.0% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. This material weakness and future material weaknesses could adversely affect our ability to report our results of operations and financial condition accurately and in a timely manner.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and provide a management report on our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. Our management is also required, on a quarterly basis, to disclose any changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAs described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management identified a deficiency within our information technology (IT) general controls (collectively, ITGCs) related to ineffective segregation of duties within our IT systems which is part of our internal control over financial reporting. Process-level controls that were dependent upon information derived from these IT systems were also determined to be ineffective. These deficiencies were the result of an inadequate IT risk assessment process which did not identify the risks associated with ineffective segregation of duties within these IT systems. The control deficiencies described above resulted in no material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements; however, these control deficiencies create a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to our financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result, management concluded that these control deficiencies represent a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2019. We are currently taking actions to remediate the material weakness and are implementing additional processes and controls designed to address the underlying causes that led to the deficiencies. Please see \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\u201d for information regarding the material weakness and our remediation efforts.\nAny failure to maintain such internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq), we could face severe consequences from those authorities. In either case, there could result a material adverse effect on our business. Inferior internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock. We can give no assurance that the measures we have taken and plan to take in the future will remediate the material weaknesses identified or that any additional material weaknesses or restatements of financial results will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or circumvention of these controls. In\naddition, even if we are successful in strengthening our controls and procedures, in the future those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or errors or to facilitate the fair presentation of our consolidated financial statements.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of our cash reserves and may not use them effectively.\nOur management has broad discretion over the management of our operations and cash resources and could deploy our resources in ways that do not improve our business, including our ganaxolone clinical development programs, or enhance the value of our common stock. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could result in financial losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, cause the market price of our common stock to decline and delay the development of ganaxolone.\nWe are required to meet the NASDAQ Stock Market\u2019s continued listing requirements and other NASDAQ rules, or we may risk delisting. Delisting could negatively affect the price of our common stock, which could make it more difficult for us to sell securities in a future financing or for you to sell our common stock.\nWe are required to meet the continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market and other NASDAQ rules, including those regarding director independence and independent committee requirements, minimum stockholders\u2019 equity, minimum share price and certain other corporate governance requirements. In particular, we are required to maintain a minimum bid price for our listed common stock of $1.00 per share. If we do not meet these continued listing requirements, our common stock could be delisted. Delisting from the NASDAQ Stock Market would cause us to pursue eligibility for trading of these securities on other markets or exchanges, or on the \u201cpink sheets.\u201d In such case, our stockholders\u2019 ability to trade, or obtain quotations of the market value of our common stock would be severely limited because of lower trading volumes and transaction delays. These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices of these securities. There can be no assurance that our securities, if delisted from the NASDAQ Stock Market in the future, would be listed on a national securities exchange, a national quotation service, the over-the-counter markets or the pink sheets. Delisting from the NASDAQ Stock Market, or even the issuance of a notice of potential delisting, would also result in negative publicity, make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital, cause us to lose eligibility to register the sale or resale of our shares on Form S-3 and the automatic exemption from registration under state securities laws for exchange-listed securities, adversely affect the market liquidity of our securities, decrease securities analysts\u2019 coverage of us or diminish investor, supplier and employee confidence.", "PERMNO": 14815, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "MRNS"}
