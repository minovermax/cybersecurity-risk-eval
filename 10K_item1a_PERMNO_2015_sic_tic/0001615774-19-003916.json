RISK FACTORS.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nBecause we have a limited operating history to evaluate our company, the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered by an early-stage company.\nSince we have a limited operating history in our current business of technology development, it will make it difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate our business and prospects. You must consider our prospects in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties we face as an early stage company with a limited operating history. Investors should evaluate an investment in our securities in light of the uncertainties encountered by early stage companies in an intensely competitive industry. The technology development industry is intensely competitive and there can be no assurance that our efforts to identify and target development stage technology companies with intellectual property we can acquire or license will be successful or that we will be able to become profitable.\nWe continue to incur operating losses and may not achieve profitability.\nOur loss from operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $6.9 million and $3.8 million, respectively. Our net income for the years ended December 31, 2018 was $2.0 and net loss for the years ended December 31, 2017 was $3.3 million. Our accumulated deficit was $139.78 million at December 31, 2018. We recognized $28,000 and $1.2 million in revenue in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our ability to become profitable depends upon our ability to generate revenue from the monetization of intellectual property. We do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue from such monetization. Even though our revenue may increase, we expect to incur significant additional losses while we grow and expand our business. We cannot predict if and when we will achieve profitability. Our failure to achieve and sustain profitability could negatively impact the market price of our common stock.\nWe expect to need additional capital to fund our growing operations and if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, we may be forced to limit the scope of our operations.\nWe expect that for our business to grow we will need additional working capital. If adequate additional debt and/or equity financing is not available on reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to continue to expand our business or pay our outstanding obligations, and we will have to modify our business plans accordingly. These factors would have a material adverse effect on our future operating results and our financial condition.\nIf we reach a point where we are unable to raise needed additional funds to continue as a going concern, we will be forced to cease our activities and dissolve the Company. In such an event, we will need to satisfy various creditors and other claimants, severance, lease termination and other dissolution-related obligations and we may not have sufficient funds to pay to our stockholders.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud and our business may be harmed and our stock price may be adversely impacted.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports or to prevent fraud could harm our business. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management to evaluate and assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In order to continue to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to continuously evaluate and, where appropriate, enhance our policies, procedures and internal controls. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting, we could be subject to litigation or regulatory scrutiny and investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports. We cannot assure you that in the future we will be able to fully comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or that management will conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. If we fail to fully comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our business may be harmed and our stock price may decline.\nOur assessment, testing and evaluation of the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting resulted in our conclusion that, as of December 31, 2018, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective, due to our lack of segregation of duties, and lack of controls in place to ensure that all material transactions and developments impacting the financial statements are reflected. We can provide no assurance as to conclusions of management with respect to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in the future.\nOur independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nDue to our net losses, negative cash flow and negative working capital, in their report on our audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe may seek to internally develop additional new inventions and intellectual property, which would take time and be costly. Moreover, the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights for such inventions would lead to the loss of our investments in such activities.\nPart of our business may include the internal development of new inventions or intellectual property that we will seek to monetize. For example, as a result of our acquisition of certain shares of common stock of Hoth Therapeutics, Inc. (\u201cHoth\u201d) in June 2017, we have indirectly acquired certain sublicensing rights for BioLexa products developed by Chelexa Biosciences, Inc., for the treatment of eczema. Hoth is developing BioLexa\u2019s applications in the aesthetic dermatology field to help treat and reduce post-procedure infections, accelerate healing and improve clinical outcomes for patients undergoing procedures and also intends to implement FDA testing procedures for BioLexa. Should we choose to assist in the development of BioLexa\u2019s applications and/or internally develop any other inventions or intellectual property, such aspect of our business will require significant capital and will take time to achieve. Such activities may also distract our management team from its present business initiatives, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business. There is also the risk that our initiatives in this regard would not yield any viable new inventions or technology, which would lead to a loss of our investments in time and resources in such activities.\nIn addition, even if we are able to internally develop new inventions, in order for those inventions to be viable and to compete effectively, we would need to develop and maintain, and we would heavily rely upon, a proprietary position with respect to such inventions and intellectual property. However, there are significant risks associated with any such intellectual property we may develop principally, including the following:\n\u25cf patent applications we may file may not result in issued patents or may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents;\n\u25cf we may be subject to interference proceedings;\n\u25cf we may be subject to opposition proceedings in the U.S. or foreign countries;\n\u25cf any patents that are issued to us may not provide meaningful protection;\n\u25cf we may not be able to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u25cf other companies may challenge patents issued to us;\n\u25cf other companies may have independently developed and/or patented (or may in the future independently develop and patent) similar or alternative technologies, or duplicate our technologies;\n\u25cf other companies may design around technologies we have developed; and\n\u25cf enforcement of our patents could be complex, uncertain and very expensive.\nWe cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any future applications, or that any of our patents, once issued, will provide us with adequate protection from competing products. For example, issued patents may be circumvented or challenged, declared invalid or unenforceable, or narrowed in scope. In addition, since publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we will be the first to make our additional new inventions or to file patent applications covering those inventions. It is also possible that others may have or may obtain issued patents that could prevent us from commercializing our products or require us to obtain licenses requiring the payment of significant fees or royalties in order to enable us to conduct our business. As to those patents that we may license or otherwise monetize, our rights will depend on maintaining our obligations to the licensor under the applicable license agreement, and we may be unable to do so. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights for our inventions would lead to the loss our business.\nMoreover, patent application delays could cause delays in recognizing revenue from our internally generated patents and could cause us to miss opportunities to license patents before other competing technologies are developed or introduced into the market.\nOur ability to raise additional capital may be adversely affected by certain of our agreements.\nOur ability to raise additional capital for use in our operating activities may be adversely impacted by the terms of a securities purchase agreement, dated as of July 15, 2015 (the \u201cSecurities Purchase Agreement\u201d), between us and the investors who purchased securities in our July 2015 offering of our common stock and warrants for the purchase of our common stock. The Securities Purchase Agreement provides that, until the warrants issued thereunder are no longer outstanding, we will not effect or enter into a variable rate transaction, which includes issuances of securities whose prices or conversion prices may vary with the trading prices of or quotations for the shares of our common Stock at any time after the initial issuance of such securities, as well as the entry into agreements where our stock would be issued at a future-determined price. These warrants may remain outstanding as late as January 22, 2021, when the warrants expire in accordance with their terms. These restrictions may have an adverse impact on our ability to raise additional capital, or to use our cash to make certain payments that we are contractually obligated to make.\nWe are exploring and evaluating strategic alternatives and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, or completing any strategic alternative or that any such strategic alternative will yield additional value for shareholders.\nOur management and Board of Directors has commenced a review of strategic alternatives which could result in, among other things, a sale, a merger, consolidation or business combination, asset divestiture, partnering or other collaboration agreements, or potential acquisitions or recapitalizations, in one or more transactions, or continuing to operate with our current business plan and strategy. For example, on October 10, 2018, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with CBM Biopharma, Inc. (\u201cCBM\u201d), pursuant to which all shares of capital stock of CBM will be converted into 15,000,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. CBM is a privately pharmaceutical company focused on the development of cancer treatments. There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in the identification or consummation of any transaction, and there can be no assurance that the transaction with CBM will close. In addition, we may incur substantial expenses associated with identifying and evaluating potential strategic alternatives. The process of exploring strategic alternatives may be time consuming and disruptive to our business operations and if we are unable to effectively manage the process, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We also cannot assure you that any potential transaction or other strategic alternative, if identified, evaluated and consummated, will provide greater value to our shareholders than that reflected in the current stock price. Any potential transaction would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among other factors, market conditions, industry trends, the interest of third parties in our business and the availability of financing to potential buyers on reasonable terms.\nOur acquisitions of patent assets may be time consuming, complex and costly, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nIdentifying and targeting development stage technology companies and acquiring their patents or other intellectual property assets, which are critical to our business plan, are often time consuming, complex and costly to consummate. We may elect to not pursue any additional patents while we focus our efforts on monetizing our existing assets. We may utilize many different transaction structures in our acquisitions and the terms of such acquisition agreements tend to be heavily negotiated. As a result, we expect to incur significant operating expenses and will likely be required to raise capital during the negotiations even if the acquisition is ultimately not consummated, or if we determine to acquire additional patents or other assets. Even if we are able to identify a particular target, there is no guarantee that we will generate sufficient revenue related to such target\u2019s underlying intellectual property assets to offset the acquisition costs, and we may be required to pay significant amounts of deferred purchase price if we monetize those patents above certain thresholds. While we will seek to conduct confirmatory due diligence on the patent assets we are considering for acquisition, we may acquire patent assets from a seller who does not have complete analysis of infringements or claims, have valid or sole title or ownership to those assets, or otherwise provides us with flawed ownership rights, including invalid or unenforceable assets. In those cases, we may be required to spend significant resources to defend our interest in the patent assets and, if we are not successful, our acquisition may be worthless, in which case we could lose part or all of our investment in the assets.\nWe may also identify targets with patent or other intellectual property assets that cost more than we are prepared to spend with our own capital resources. We may incur significant costs to organize and negotiate a structured acquisition that does not ultimately result in an acquisition of any patent assets or, if consummated, proves to be unprofitable for us. Acquisitions involving issuance of our securities could be dilutive to existing stockholders and could be at prices lower than those prices reflected in the trading markets. These higher costs could adversely affect our operating results and, if we incur losses, the value of our securities will decline. The integration of acquired assets may place a significant burden on management and our internal resources. The diversion of management attention and any difficulties encountered in the integration process could harm our business.\nAs we are targeting technology companies in the development stage, their patents and technologies are in the early stages of adoption. Demand for some of these technologies will likely be untested and may be subject to fluctuation based upon the rate at which our licensees or others adopt our patents and technologies in their products and services. As a result, there can be no assurance as to whether technologies we acquire or develop will have value that can be realized through licensing or other activities.\nWe are exploring and evaluating strategic alternatives and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, or completing any strategic alternative or that any such strategic alternative will yield additional value for shareholders.\nOur management and Board of Directors has commenced a review of strategic alternatives which could result in, among other things, a sale, a merger, consolidation or business combination, asset divestiture, partnering or other collaboration agreements, or potential acquisitions or recapitalizations, in one or more transactions, or continuing to operate with our current business plan and strategy. For example, on October 10, 2018, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with CBM Biopharma, Inc. (\u201cCBM\u201d), pursuant to which all shares of capital stock of CBM will be converted into 15,000,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. CBM is a privately pharmaceutical company focused on the development of cancer treatments. There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in the identification or consummation of any transaction, and there can be no assurance that the transaction with CBM will close. In addition, we may incur substantial expenses associated with identifying and evaluating potential strategic alternatives. The process of exploring strategic alternatives may be time consuming and disruptive to our business operations and if we are unable to effectively manage the process, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We also cannot assure you that any potential transaction or other strategic alternative, if identified, evaluated and consummated, will provide greater value to our shareholders than that reflected in the current stock price. Any potential transaction would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among other factors, market conditions, industry trends, the interest of third parties in our business and the availability of financing to potential buyers on reasonable terms.\nWe may be unsuccessful at integrating future acquisitions.\nIf we find appropriate opportunities in the future, we may acquire businesses to strategically increase the number of patents in our portfolio and pursue monetization. For example, on June 30, 2017, we acquired a stake in Hoth Therapeutics, Inc. (\u201cHoth\u201d), a development stage biopharmaceutical company focused on unique targeted therapeutics for patients suffering from indications such as atopic dermatitis, also known as eczema. Hoth has a sublicense from Chelexa Biosciences, Inc. to use Chelexa\u2019s BioLexa products for the treatment of eczema and such sublicense includes the right to further sublicense to third parties to make, use, have made, import, offer for sale and sell BioLexa products. There can be no guarantee that Hoth will be successful in its efforts to monetize its sublicense agreement with Chelexa. In addition, on March 12, 2018, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with DatChat, pursuant to which we were going to acquire 100% ownership of DatChat, which is a privately held personal privacy platform focused on encrypted communication, internet security and digital rights management, which we subsequently terminated on August 8, 2018. Most recently, on October 10, 2018, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with CBM, pursuant to which CBM will be the surviving corporation in the merger. There can be no guarantee that we will be successful in closing the transaction contemplated by the agreement with CBM or that we will be successful in managing the operations of CBM, which is in the early stages of development of cancer treatments.\nAs we acquire businesses or substantial stakes in certain businesses, the process of integration may produce unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, fail to result in expected synergies or other benefits and absorb significant attention of our management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business. In addition, in the event of any future acquisitions, we may record a portion of the assets we acquire as goodwill, other indefinite-lived intangible assets or finite-lived intangible assets. We do not amortize goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, but rather review them for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. The recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future earnings and cash flows. Changes in estimates, circumstances or conditions, resulting from both internal and external factors, could have a significant impact on our fair valuation determination, which could then have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities, consummate any pending or future acquisitions or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from any such acquisitions.\nIf the CBM merger is completed, the Company may not be able to successfully integrate the business of CBM and realize the anticipated benefits of the merger.\nRealization of the anticipated benefits in the merger with CBM will depend on our ability to successfully integrate our businesses and operations with CBM. We will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating its business practices, operations, and support functions. The process of integrating CBM\u2019s operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, our business and financial performance, and in CBM\u2019s business and financial performance as well. The diversion of management\u2019s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the merger and the integration of the two companies\u2019 operations could have an adverse effect on the business, financial results.\nOur stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the merger and will exercise less influence over our management and policies than they did prior to the Merger.\nOur stockholders currently have the right to vote in the election of our board of directors on other matters affecting us. When, and if the merger occurs, because of the issuance of shares of common stock to the CBM shareholders, our current stockholders will hold a percentage ownership of the post-merger company that is much smaller than the stockholder\u2019s current percentage ownership of ours. Because of this, our current stockholders will have less influence over the management and policies of the Company than they now have after the consummation of the merger.\nThe merger with CBM is subject to certain conditions to closing that could result in the merger not being completed or being delayed, either of which could negatively impact its stock price and future business and results of operations. In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to certain sections of the Agreement, then the Company may be required to deliver to CBM certificate(s) representing an aggregate of 400,000 shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock within two (2) business days of termination.\nCompletion of the merger is subject to a number of customary conditions, including, but not limited to, the approval of the merger Agreement by our stockholders. In addition, if any governmental authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated or enforced any law or order which has the effect of making the transactions or agreements contemplated by the Merger Agreement illegal or which otherwise prevents or prohibits consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, CBM may elect not to consummate the Merger. There is no assurance that we will satisfy the conditions necessary for completion of the merger. If any of the conditions to the merger are not satisfied or, where waiver is permissible, waived, the merger will not be consummated. Failure to complete the merger would prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits of the merger. We have already and expect to continue to incur significant costs associated with transaction fees, professional services, taxes and other costs related to the merger. In the event that the merger is not completed, we will remain liable for these costs and expenses. In addition, the current market price of our common stock may reflect a market assumption that the merger will occur, and a failure to complete the merger could result in a negative perception by the market of ours generally and a resulting decline in the market price of the our common stock. The market price may also decline if the market disapproves of the Merger. Any delay in the consummation of the merger or any uncertainty about the consummation of the merger could also negatively impact our stock price and future business and results of operations. The merger may not be consummated, there may be a delay in the consummation of the merger or the merger may not be consummated on the terms contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nWe may be unsuccessful at integrating future acquisitions.\nIf we find appropriate opportunities in the future, we may acquire businesses to strategically increase the number of patents in our portfolio and pursue monetization. For example, on June 30, 2017, we acquired a stake in Hoth Therapeutics, Inc. (\u201cHoth\u201d), a development stage biopharmaceutical company focused on unique targeted therapeutics for patients suffering from indications such as atopic dermatitis, also known as eczema. Hoth has a sublicense from Chelexa Biosciences, Inc. to use Chelexa\u2019s BioLexa products for the treatment of eczema and such sublicense includes the right to further sublicense to third parties to make, use, have made, import, offer for sale and sell BioLexa products. There can be no guarantee that Hoth will be successful in its efforts to monetize its sublicense agreement with Chelexa. In addition, on March 12, 2018, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with DatChat, Inc. (\u201cDatChat\u201d), pursuant to which we were going to acquire 100% ownership of DatChat, which is a privately held personal privacy platform focused on encrypted communication, internet security and digital rights management, which we subsequently terminated on August 8, 2018. Most recently, on October 10, 2018, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with CBM, pursuant to which CBM will be the surviving corporation in the merger. There can be no guarantee that we will be successful in closing the transaction contemplated by the agreement with CBM or that we will be successful in managing the operations of CBM, which is in the early stages of development of cancer treatments.\nAs we acquire businesses or substantial stakes in certain businesses, the process of integration may produce unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, fail to result in expected synergies or other benefits and absorb significant attention of our management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business. In addition, in the event of any future acquisitions, we may record a portion of the assets we acquire as goodwill, other indefinite-lived intangible assets or finite-lived intangible assets. We do not amortize goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, but rather review them for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. The recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future earnings and cash flows. Changes in estimates, circumstances or conditions, resulting from both internal and external factors, could have a significant impact on our fair valuation determination, which could then have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities, consummate any pending or future acquisitions or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from any such acquisitions.\nAny failure to maintain or protect our patent assets or other intellectual property rights could significantly impair our return on investment from such assets and harm our brand, our business and our operating results.\nOur ability to operate our new line of business and compete in the intellectual property market largely depends on the superiority, uniqueness and value of our acquired patent assets and other intellectual property. To protect our proprietary rights, we will rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties, and protective contractual provisions. No assurances can be given that any of the measures we undertake to protect and maintain our assets will have any measure of success.\nWe are required to spend significant time and resources to maintain the effectiveness of our assets by paying maintenance fees and making filings with the USPTO. We may acquire patent assets, including patent applications, which require us to spend resources to prosecute the applications with the USPTO prior to issuance of patents. Further, there is a material risk that patent related claims (such as, for example, infringement claims (and/or claims for indemnification resulting therefrom), unenforceability claims, or invalidity claims) will be asserted or prosecuted against us, and such assertions or prosecutions could materially and adversely affect our business. For instance, in connection with inter partes review in our now-settled litigations with VTech and Uniden, the Patent Trial and Appeals Board has found that certain portions of the claims relating to certain of our patents are invalid. Regardless of whether any such claims are valid or can be successfully asserted, defending such claims could cause us to incur significant costs and could divert resources away from our other activities.\nDespite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, any of the following or similar occurrences may reduce the value of our intellectual property:\n\u25cf our applications for patents, trademarks and copyrights may not be granted and, if granted, may be challenged or invalidated;\n\u25cf issued trademarks, copyrights, or patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages when compared to potentially infringing other properties;\n\u25cf our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights may not be effective in preventing misappropriation of our technology; or\n\u25cf our efforts may not prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to or competitive with, or superior to those we acquire and/or prosecute.\nMoreover, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in certain foreign countries where we may do business or enforce our patents against infringers in foreign countries. If we fail to maintain, defend or prosecute our patent assets properly, the value of those assets would be reduced or eliminated, and our business would be harmed.\nWe may be unable to issue securities under our shelf registration statement, which may have an adverse effect on our liquidity.\nWe have filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC. The registration statement, which has been declared effective, was filed in reliance on Instruction I.B.6. of Form S-3, which imposes a limitation on the maximum amount of securities that we may sell pursuant to the registration statement during any twelve-month period. At the time we sell securities pursuant to the registration statement, the amount of securities to be sold plus the amount of any securities we have sold during the prior twelve months in reliance on Instruction I.B.6. may not exceed one-third of the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates as of a day during the 60 days immediately preceding such sale as computed in accordance with Instruction I.B.6. Whether we sell securities under the registration statement will depend on a number of factors, including availability of our existing S-3 under the 1/3 limitation calculations set forth in Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3, the market conditions at that time, our cash position at that time and the availability and terms of alternative sources of capital. Furthermore, Instruction I.B.6. of Form S-3 requires that the issuer have at least one class of common equity securities listed and registered on a national securities exchange. If we are not able to maintain compliance with applicable NASDAQ rules, we will no longer be able to rely upon that Instruction. If we cannot sell securities under our shelf registration, we may be required to utilize more costly and time-consuming means of accessing the capital markets, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity and cash position.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe face evolving regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure that may result in additional expenses and continuing uncertainty.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or SOX, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Global Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time towards maintaining compliance with these requirements. These rules, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest the resources necessary to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, which could be costly and time-consuming, and our reputation and business may be harmed.\nOur common stock may be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market if we fail to comply with continued listing standards.\nOur common stock is currently traded on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol \u201cSPEX.\u201d If we fail to meet any of the continued listing standards of The NASDAQ Capital Market, our common stock could be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market. These continued listing standards include specifically enumerated criteria, such as:\n\u25cf a $1.00 minimum closing bid price;\n\u25cf stockholders\u2019 equity of $2.5 million;\n\u25cf 500,000 shares of publicly-held common stock with a market value of at least $1 million;\n\u25cf 300 round-lot stockholders; and\n\u25cf compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s corporate governance requirements, as well as additional or more stringent criteria that may be applied in the exercise of NASDAQ\u2019s discretionary authority.\nOn November 27, 2018, we received a deficiency notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) informing the Company that its common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, failed to comply with the $1.00 minimum bid price required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). Nasdaq\u2019s letter advised the Company that, based upon the closing bid price during the period from October 15, 2018 to November 26, 2018, the Company no longer meets this test.\nPursuant to Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has been provided an initial compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until May 28, 2019, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of the Company\u2019s common stock must meet or exceed $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days prior to May 28, 2019.\nIn addition, on January 11, 2019, the Company received written notice (the \u201cNotice\u201d) from the Listing Qualifications Department (the \u201cStaff\u201d) of Nasdaq indicating that, based upon the Company\u2019s non-compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5620(a), which requires an issuer to hold an annual meeting of shareholders no later than one year after the end of the Company\u2019s fiscal year-end (the \u201cAnnual Meeting Rule\u201d), the Company would be required to submit a plan to regain compliance with the Annual Meeting Rule for the Staff\u2019s consideration by no later than February 25, 2019. The Notice has no immediate impact on the Company\u2019s listing or trading in the Company\u2019s securities on Nasdaq.\nThe Company has been provided an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the Company\u2019s fiscal year end, through July 1, 2019, to evidence compliance with the Annual Meeting Rule. As announced to the Company\u2019s stockholders on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 6, 2019, the Company has established April 15, 2019 as the date of the Company\u2019s 2019 annual meeting of stockholders.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance and remain in compliance in the future. In particular, our share price may continue to decline for a number of reasons, including many that are beyond our control. See \u201cOur share price may be volatile and there may not be an active trading market for our common stock\u201d.\nIf we fail to comply with NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing standards, we may be delisted and our common stock will trade, if at all, only on the over-the-counter market, such as the OTC Bulletin Board or OTCQX market, and then only if one or more registered broker-dealer market makers comply with quotation requirements. In addition, delisting of our common stock could depress our stock price, substantially limit liquidity of our common stock and materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Further, delisting of our common stock would likely result in our common stock becoming a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under the Exchange Act.\nOur share price may be volatile and there may not be an active trading market for our common stock.\nThere can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will not decline below its present market price or that there will be an active trading market for our common stock. The market prices of technology or technology related companies have been and are likely to continue to be highly volatile. Fluctuations in our operating results and general market conditions for technology or technology related stocks could have a significant impact on the volatility of our common stock price. We have experienced significant volatility in the price of our common stock. From January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018, the share price of our common stock (on a split-adjusted basis) ranged from a high of $3.92 to a low of $0.57. The reason for the volatility in our stock is not well understood and may continue. Factors that may have contributed to such volatility include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf introduction of new technologies by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf government regulations and laws;\n\u25cf public sentiment relating to our industry;\n\u25cf developments in patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf the number of shares issued and outstanding;\n\u25cf the number of shares trading on an average trading day;\n\u25cf performance of companies in the non-performing entity space generally;\n\u25cf announcements regarding other participants in the technology and technology related industries, including our competitors;\n\u25cf block sales of our shares by stockholders to whom we have sold stock in private placements, or the cessation of transfer restrictions with respect to those shares; and\n\u25cf market speculation regarding any of the foregoing.\nWe could fail in future financing efforts or be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market if we fail to receive stockholder approval when needed.\nWe are required under the NASDAQ rules to obtain stockholder approval for any issuance of additional equity securities that would comprise more than 20% of the total shares of our common stock outstanding before the issuance of such securities sold at a discount to the greater of book or market value in an offering that is not deemed to be a \u201cpublic offering\u201d by NASDAQ. Funding of our operations and acquisitions of assets may require issuance of additional equity securities that would comprise more than 20% of the total shares of our common stock outstanding, but we might not be successful in obtaining the required stockholder approval for such an issuance. If we are unable to obtain financing due to stockholder approval difficulties, such failure may have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations.\nOur shares of common stock are thinly traded and, as a result, stockholders may be unable to sell at or near ask prices, or at all, if they need to sell shares to raise money or otherwise desire to liquidate their shares.\nOur common stock has been \u201cthinly-traded\u201d meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common stock at or near ask prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation is attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company that is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and would be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we become more seasoned and viable. Our trading volumes are further adversely affected by the 1-for-19 reverse stock split that was effective as of March 4, 2016. In addition, we believe that due to the limited number of shares of our common stock outstanding, an options market has not been established for our common stock, limiting the ability of market participants to hedge or otherwise undertake trading strategies available for larger companies with broader shareholder bases which prevents institutions and others from acquiring or trading in our securities. Consequently, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. We cannot give stockholders any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our common shares will develop or be sustained, or that current trading levels will be sustained.\nBecause of the Rights Agreement and \u201canti-takeover\u201d provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, a third party may be discouraged from making a takeover offer that could be beneficial to our stockholders.\nEffective as of January 24, 2013, we adopted a shareholder rights plan which was amended and restated as of June 9, 2017. The effect of this rights plan and of certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws, and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us or replacing members of our Board of Directors, or make more costly any attempt to acquire control of the Company, even if the acquisition or the Board designees would be beneficial to our stockholders. These factors could also reduce the price that certain investors might be willing to pay for shares of the common stock and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions.\nDividends on our common stock are not likely.\nDuring the last five years, we have not paid cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Investors must look solely to the potential for appreciation in the market price of the shares of our common stock to obtain a return on their investment.\nIf we fail to retain our key personnel, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business could suffer.\nOur future depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and the continued contributions of our executive officers, each of whom may be difficult to replace. In particular, Anthony Hayes, our Chief Executive Officer, is important to the management of our business and operations and the development of our strategic direction. The loss of the services of any such individual and the process to replace any key personnel would involve significant time and expense and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.", "PERMNO": 18148, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "AIKI"}
