{"cik": "764180", "company": "ALTRIA GROUP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our results of operations, our cash flows, our financial position and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe (1) may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including earnings guidance and other statements contained in filings with the SEC, reports to security holders, press releases and investor webcasts. You can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as \u201cstrategy,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201ccontinues,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cforecasts,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201cgoals,\u201d \u201cobjectives,\u201d \u201cguidance,\u201d \u201ctargets\u201d and other words of similar meaning. You can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.\nWe cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans, estimates and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. You should bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in Altria\u2019s securities. In connection with the \u201csafe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in, or implied by, any forward-looking statements made by us; any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements. We elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K particularly in the \u201cBusiness Environment\u201d sections preceding our discussion of the operating results of our subsidiaries\u2019 businesses below in Item 7. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time except as required by applicable law.\nUnfavorable litigation outcomes could materially adversely affect the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries.\nLegal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions\n_________________________________________________\n(1) This section uses the terms \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d and \u201cus\u201d when it is not necessary to distinguish among Altria and its various operating subsidiaries or when any distinction is clear from the context.\nagainst Altria and its subsidiaries, including PM USA and UST and its subsidiaries, as well as their respective indemnitees. Various types of claims may be raised in these proceedings, including product liability, consumer protection, antitrust, tax, contraband-related claims, patent infringement, employment matters, claims for contribution and claims of competitors, shareholders and distributors.\nLitigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending or future cases. An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco-related or other litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation. Damages claimed in some tobacco-related or other litigation are significant and, in certain cases, have ranged in the billions of dollars. The variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions, together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome.\nIn certain cases, plaintiffs claim that defendants\u2019 liability is joint and several. In such cases, Altria or its subsidiaries may face the risk that one or more co-defendants decline or otherwise fail to participate in the bonding required for an appeal or to pay their proportionate or jury-allocated share of a judgment. As a result, Altria or its subsidiaries under certain circumstances may have to pay more than their proportionate share of any bonding- or judgment-related amounts. Furthermore, in those cases where plaintiffs are successful, Altria or its subsidiaries may also be required to pay interest and attorneys\u2019 fees.\nAlthough PM USA has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed, there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases. This risk has been substantially reduced given that 47 states and Puerto Rico now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all. As discussed in Note 19. Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 (\u201cNote 19\u201d), tobacco litigation plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of Florida\u2019s bond cap statute in several cases and plaintiffs may challenge state bond cap statutes in other jurisdictions as well. Such challenges may include the applicability of state bond caps in federal court. Although we cannot predict the outcome of such challenges, it is possible that the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria, or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries, could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome of one or more such challenges.\nIn certain litigation, Altria and its subsidiaries may face potentially significant non-monetary remedies, which may cause reputational harm. For example, in the lawsuit brought by the United States Department of Justice, discussed in detail in Note 19, the district court did not impose monetary penalties but ordered significant non-monetary remedies, including the issuance of \u201ccorrective statements.\u201d\nAltria and its subsidiaries have achieved substantial success in managing litigation. Nevertheless, litigation is subject to uncertainty, and significant challenges remain.\nIt is possible that the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria, or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries, could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. Altria and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe, and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases, that it has valid defenses to the litigation pending against it, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts. Each of the companies has defended, and will continue to defend, vigorously against litigation challenges. However, Altria and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of Altria to do so. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\u201cItem 3\u201d), Note 19 and Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of pending tobacco-related litigation.\nSignificant federal, state and local governmental actions, including actions by the FDA, and various private sector actions may continue to have an adverse impact on us and our tobacco subsidiaries\u2019 businesses and sales volumes.\nAs described in Tobacco Space - Business Environment in Item 7, our cigarette subsidiaries face significant governmental and private sector actions, including efforts aimed at reducing the incidence of tobacco use and efforts seeking to hold these subsidiaries responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. These actions, combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking, have resulted in reduced cigarette industry volume, and we expect that these factors will continue to reduce cigarette consumption levels.\nMore broadly, actions by the FDA and other federal, state or local governments or agencies, including those specific actions described in Tobacco Space - Business Environment in Item 7, may impact the adult tobacco consumer acceptability of or access to tobacco products (for example, through product standards that may be proposed by the FDA for nicotine and flavors), limit adult tobacco consumer choices, delay or prevent the launch of new or modified tobacco products or products with claims of reduced risk, require the recall or other removal of tobacco products from the marketplace (for example as a result of product contamination, rulemaking that bans menthol, a determination by the FDA that one or more tobacco products do not satisfy the statutory requirements for substantial equivalence, because the FDA requires that a currently-marketed tobacco product proceed through the pre-market review process or because the FDA otherwise determines that removal is necessary for the protection of public health), restrict communications to adult tobacco consumers, restrict the ability to differentiate tobacco products, create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies, impose additional manufacturing, labeling or packing requirements, interrupt manufacturing or otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business, or restrict or prevent the use of specified tobacco products in certain locations or the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments. Any one or more of these actions may have a material adverse\nimpact on the business, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco subsidiaries. See Tobacco Space - Business Environment in Item 7 for a more detailed discussion.\nTobacco products are subject to substantial taxation, which could have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of Altria\u2019s tobacco subsidiaries.\nTobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes, and significant increases in tobacco product-related taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted within the United States at the federal, state and local levels. Tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of our tobacco subsidiaries through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the non-premium or discount segments or to other low-priced or low-taxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products. Such shifts may have an adverse impact on the reported share performance of tobacco products of Altria\u2019s tobacco subsidiaries. For further discussion, see Tobacco Space - Business Environment - Excise Taxes in Item 7.\nOur tobacco businesses face significant competition (including across categories) and their failure to compete effectively could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or cash flows of Altria, or the business of Altria\u2019s tobacco subsidiaries.\nEach of Altria\u2019s tobacco subsidiaries operates in highly competitive tobacco categories. This competition also exists across categories as adult tobacco consumer preferences evolve. Significant methods of competition include product quality, taste, price, product innovation, marketing, packaging, distribution and promotional activities. A highly competitive environment could negatively impact the profitability, market share and shipment volume of our tobacco subsidiaries, which could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or cash flows of Altria. See Tobacco Space - Business Environment - Summary in Item 7 for additional discussion concerning evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences, including e-vapor products. Growth of the e-vapor product category and other innovative tobacco products has further contributed to reductions in cigarette consumption levels and cigarette industry sales volume and has adversely affected the growth rates of other tobacco products. Continued growth in these categories could have a material adverse impact on the business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position of PM USA and USSTC.\nPM USA also faces competition from lowest priced brands sold by certain United States and foreign manufacturers that have cost advantages because they are not parties to settlements of certain tobacco litigation in the United States. These settlements, among other factors, resulted in substantial cigarette price increases. These manufacturers may fail to comply with related state escrow legislation or may avoid escrow deposit obligations on the majority of their sales by concentrating on certain states\nwhere escrow deposits are not required or are required on fewer than all such manufacturers\u2019 cigarettes sold in such states. Additional competition has resulted from diversion into the United States market of cigarettes intended for sale outside the United States, the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties, the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes, and imports of foreign lowest priced brands. USSTC faces significant competition in the smokeless tobacco category and has experienced consumer down-trading to lower-priced brands.\nAltria and its subsidiaries may be unsuccessful in anticipating changes in adult consumer preferences, responding to changes in consumer purchase behavior or managing through difficult competitive and economic conditions, which could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of Altria or the business of Altria\u2019s tobacco subsidiaries.\nEach of our tobacco and wine subsidiaries is subject to intense competition and changes in adult consumer preferences. To be successful, they must continue to:\n\u25aa\npromote brand equity successfully;\n\u25aa\nanticipate and respond to new and evolving adult consumer preferences;\n\u25aa\ndevelop, manufacture, market and distribute new and innovative products that appeal to adult consumers (including, where appropriate, through arrangements with, or investments in, third parties);\n\u25aa\nimprove productivity; and\n\u25aa\nprotect or enhance margins through cost savings and price increases.\nSee Tobacco Space - Business Environment - Summary in Item 7 and the immediately preceding risk factor for additional discussion concerning evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences, specifically the growth of e-vapor and other innovative tobacco products and the effects on our tobacco operating companies.\nThe willingness of adult consumers to purchase premium consumer product brands depends in part on economic conditions. In periods of economic uncertainty, adult consumers may purchase more discount brands and/or, in the case of tobacco products, consider lower-priced tobacco products, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its subsidiaries. While our tobacco and wine subsidiaries work to broaden their brand portfolios to compete effectively with lower-priced products, the failure to do so could negatively impact our companies\u2019 ability to compete in these circumstances.\nOur financial services business (conducted through PMCC) holds investments in finance leases, principally in transportation (including aircraft), power generation, real estate and manufacturing equipment. Its lessees are subject to significant competition and uncertain economic conditions. If parties to PMCC\u2019s leases fail to manage through difficult economic and\ncompetitive conditions, PMCC may have to increase its allowance for losses, which would adversely affect our earnings.\nAltria\u2019s tobacco subsidiaries and investees may be unsuccessful in developing and commercializing adjacent products or processes, including innovative tobacco products that may reduce the health risks associated with current tobacco products and that appeal to adult tobacco consumers, which may have an adverse effect on their ability to grow new revenue streams and/or put them at a competitive disadvantage.\nAltria and its subsidiaries have growth strategies involving moves and potential moves into adjacent products or processes, including innovative tobacco products. Some innovative tobacco products may reduce the health risks associated with current tobacco products, while continuing to offer adult tobacco consumers (within and outside the United States) products that meet their taste expectations and evolving preferences. Examples include tobacco-containing and nicotine-containing products that reduce or eliminate exposure to cigarette smoke and/or constituents identified by public health authorities as harmful, such as e-vapor products. These efforts include arrangements with, or investments in, third parties such as our minority investment in JUUL. This minority investment subjects us to non-competition obligations restricting us from investing or engaging in the e-vapor business other than through JUUL, subject to limited exceptions. Our tobacco subsidiaries and investees may not succeed in their efforts to introduce such new products, which would have an adverse effect on the ability to grow new revenue streams.\nFurther, we cannot predict whether regulators, including the FDA, will permit the marketing or sale of products with claims of reduced risk to adult consumers, the speed with which they may make such determinations or whether regulators will impose an unduly burdensome regulatory framework on such products. Nor can we predict whether adult tobacco consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions would be affected by reduced risk claims if permitted. Adverse developments on any of these matters could negatively impact the commercial viability of such products.\nIf our tobacco subsidiaries or investees do not succeed in their efforts to develop and commercialize innovative tobacco products or to obtain regulatory approval for the marketing or sale of products with claims of reduced risk, but one or more of their competitors do succeed, our tobacco subsidiaries or investees may be at a competitive disadvantage, which could have an adverse effect on their financial performance.\nSignificant changes in price, availability or quality of tobacco, other raw materials or component parts could have an adverse effect on the profitability and business of Altria\u2019s tobacco subsidiaries.\nAny significant change in prices, quality or availability of tobacco, other raw materials or component parts could adversely affect our tobacco subsidiaries\u2019 profitability and business. For further discussion, see Tobacco Space - Business Environment -\nPrice, Availability and Quality of Tobacco, Other Raw Materials and Component Parts in Item 7.\nBecause Altria\u2019s tobacco subsidiaries rely on a few significant facilities and a small number of key suppliers, an extended disruption at a facility or in service by a supplier could have a material adverse effect on the business, the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco subsidiaries.\nAltria\u2019s tobacco subsidiaries face risks inherent in reliance on a few significant facilities and a small number of key suppliers. A natural or man-made disaster or other disruption that affects the manufacturing operations of any of Altria\u2019s tobacco subsidiaries or the operations of any key suppliers of any of Altria\u2019s tobacco subsidiaries, including as a result of a key supplier\u2019s unwillingness to supply goods or services to a tobacco company, could adversely impact the operations of the affected subsidiaries. An extended disruption in operations experienced by one or more of Altria\u2019s subsidiaries or key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the business, the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco subsidiaries.\nAltria\u2019s subsidiaries could decide or be required to recall products, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, reputation, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its subsidiaries.\nIn addition to a recall required by the FDA, as referenced above, our subsidiaries could decide, or other laws or regulations could require them, to recall products due to the failure to meet quality standards or specifications, suspected or confirmed and deliberate or unintentional product contamination, or other adulteration, product misbranding or product tampering. Product recalls could have a material adverse effect on the business, reputation, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its subsidiaries.\nThe failure of Altria\u2019s information systems or service providers\u2019 information systems to function as intended, or cyber-attacks or security breaches, could have a material adverse effect on the business, reputation, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its subsidiaries.\nAltria and its subsidiaries rely extensively on information systems, many of which are managed by third-party service providers (such as cloud providers), to support a variety of business processes and activities, including: complying with regulatory, legal, financial reporting and tax requirements; engaging in marketing and e-commerce activities; managing and improving the effectiveness of our operations; manufacturing and distributing our products; collecting and storing sensitive data and confidential information; and communicating internally and externally with employees, investors, suppliers, trade customers, adult consumers and others. We continue to make investments in\nadministrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect our information systems and data from cyber-threats, including human error and malicious acts. Our safeguards include employee training, testing and auditing protocols, backup systems and business continuity plans, maintenance of security policies and procedures, monitoring of networks and systems, and third-party risk management.\nTo date, interruptions of our information systems have been infrequent and have not had a material impact on our operations. However, because technology is increasingly complex and cyber-attacks are increasingly sophisticated and more frequent, there can be no assurance that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future. Failure of our systems or service providers\u2019 systems to function as intended, or cyber-attacks or security breaches, could result in loss of revenue, assets, personal data, intellectual property, trade secrets or other sensitive and confidential data, violation of applicable privacy and data security laws, damage to the reputation of our companies and their brands, operational disruptions, legal challenges and significant remediation and other costs to Altria and its subsidiaries.\nUnfavorable outcomes of any governmental investigations could materially affect the businesses of Altria and its subsidiaries.\nFrom time to time, Altria and its subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters. We cannot predict whether new investigations may be commenced or the outcome of any such investigation, and it is possible that our business could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of a future investigation.\nA challenge to our tax positions could adversely affect our tax rate, earnings or cash flow.\nTax laws and regulations, such as the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Reform Act\u201d), are complex and subject to varying interpretations. A successful challenge to one or more of Altria\u2019s tax positions could give rise to additional liabilities, including interest and potential penalties, as well as adversely affect our tax rate, earnings or cash flows.\nInternational business operations subject Altria and its subsidiaries to various United States and foreign laws and regulations, and violations of such laws or regulations could result in reputational harm, legal challenges and/or significant costs.\nWhile Altria and its subsidiaries are primarily engaged in business activities in the United States, they do engage (directly or indirectly) in certain international business activities that are subject to various United States and foreign laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other laws prohibiting bribery and corruption. Although we have a Code of Conduct and a compliance system designed to prevent and detect violations of applicable law, no system can provide assurance that\nit will always protect against improper actions by employees, investees or third parties. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in reputational harm, legal challenges and/or significant costs.\nAltria may be unable to attract and retain the best talent due to the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco control actions.\nOur ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best talent may be impaired by the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco regulation and control actions. The tobacco industry competes for talent with the consumer products industry and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance. As a result, we may be unable to attract and retain the best talent.\nAcquisitions or other events may adversely affect Altria\u2019s credit rating, and Altria may not achieve its anticipated strategic or financial objectives of a transaction.\nFrom time to time, Altria considers acquisitions or investments and may engage in confidential negotiations that are not publicly announced unless and until those negotiations result in a definitive agreement. Although we seek to maintain or improve our credit ratings over time, it is possible that completing a given acquisition or investment or the occurrence of other events could negatively impact our credit ratings or the outlook for those ratings as occurred following our investment in JUUL (although we continue to maintain investment grade ratings). Any such change in ratings or outlook may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate.\nFurthermore, acquisition opportunities are limited, and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings. There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or an investment.\nDisruption and uncertainty in the credit and capital markets could adversely affect Altria\u2019s access to these markets, earnings and dividend rate.\nAccess to the credit and capital markets is important for us to satisfy our liquidity and financing needs. Disruption and uncertainty in these markets and any resulting adverse impact on credit availability, pricing, credit terms or credit rating may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate.\nAltria may be required to write down intangible assets, including goodwill, due to impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.\nWe periodically calculate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets to test for impairment. This calculation may be affected by several factors, including general economic conditions, regulatory developments, changes in category growth rates as a result of changing adult consumer preferences, success of planned new product introductions, competitive activity and tobacco-related taxes. Certain events can also trigger an immediate review of intangible assets. If an impairment is determined to exist in either situation, we will incur impairment losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Altria incurred $209 million in goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges related to Altria\u2019s decision to refocus its innovative product efforts and the impairment of the Columbia Crest trademark (See Note 4. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a more detailed discussion).\nCompetition, unfavorable changes in grape supply and new governmental regulations or revisions to existing governmental regulations could adversely affect Ste. Michelle\u2019s wine business.\nSte. Michelle\u2019s business is subject to significant competition, including from many large, well-established domestic and international companies. The adequacy of Ste. Michelle\u2019s grape supply is influenced by consumer demand for wine in relation to industry-wide production levels as well as by weather and crop conditions, particularly in eastern Washington. Supply shortages related to any one or more of these factors could increase production costs and wine prices, which ultimately may have a negative impact on Ste. Michelle\u2019s sales. In addition, federal, state and local governmental agencies regulate the alcohol beverage industry through various means, including licensing requirements, pricing, labeling and advertising restrictions, and distribution and production policies. New regulations or revisions to existing regulations, resulting in further restrictions or taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages may have an adverse effect on Ste. Michelle\u2019s wine business. For further discussion, see Wine Segment - Business Environment in Item 7.\nAltria\u2019s reported earnings from and carrying value of its equity investment in AB InBev and the dividends paid by AB InBev on shares owned by Altria may be adversely affected by various factors, including foreign currency exchange rates and AB InBev\u2019s business results and stock price.\nFor purposes of financial reporting, the earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in AB InBev are translated into U.S. dollars from various local currencies. In addition, AB InBev pays dividends in euros, which we convert into U.S. dollars. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar against these currencies, our reported earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in AB InBev will be reduced because these currencies will translate into fewer U.S. dollars and\nthe dividends that we receive from AB InBev will convert into fewer U.S. dollars.\nDividends and earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in AB InBev are also subject to the risks encountered by AB InBev in its business. For example, in October 2018, AB InBev announced a 50% rebase in the dividends it pays to its shareholders, which will result in a reduction of cash dividends Altria receives from AB InBev. As discussed in the Discussion and Analysis - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Item 7, if the carrying value of our investment in AB InBev exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, the investment is considered impaired, which would result in impairment losses and could have a material adverse effect on Altria\u2019s consolidated financial position or earnings. We cannot provide any assurance that AB InBev will successfully execute its business plans and strategies. Earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in AB InBev are also subject to fluctuations in AB InBev\u2019s stock price, for example through mark-to-market losses on AB InBev\u2019s derivative financial instruments used to hedge certain share commitments.\nWe received a substantial portion of our consideration from the AB InBev Transaction in the form of restricted shares subject to a five-year lock-up. Furthermore, if our percentage ownership in AB InBev were to decrease below certain levels, we may be subject to additional tax liabilities, suffer a reduction in the number of directors that we can have appointed to the AB InBev Board of Directors and be unable to account for our investment under the equity method of accounting.\nUpon completion of the AB InBev Transaction, we received a substantial portion of our consideration in the form of restricted shares that cannot be sold or transferred for a period of five years following the AB InBev Transaction, subject to limited exceptions. These transfer restrictions will require us to bear the risks associated with our investment in AB InBev for a five-year period that expires on October 10, 2021. Further, in the event that our ownership percentage in AB InBev were to decrease below certain levels, we may be subject to additional tax liabilities, the number of directors that we have the right to have appointed to the AB InBev Board of Directors could be reduced from two to one or zero and our use of the equity method of accounting for our investment in AB InBev could be challenged.\nThe tax treatment of the consideration Altria received in the AB InBev Transaction may be challenged and the tax treatment of the AB InBev investment may not be as favorable as Altria anticipates.\nWhile we expect the equity consideration that we received from the AB InBev Transaction to qualify for tax-deferred treatment, we cannot provide any assurance that federal and state tax authorities will not challenge the expected tax treatment and, if they do, what the outcome of any such challenge will be. In addition, there is a risk that the tax treatment of our investment in AB InBev may not be as favorable as we anticipate.\nAntitrust clearance required for the conversion of our non-voting JUUL shares into voting shares may not be obtained in a timely manner or at all, and the expected benefits of the JUUL transaction may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe or at all.\nAntitrust clearance required for the conversion of the non-voting JUUL shares held by us into voting shares may not be obtained in a timely manner or at all, and such clearance may be subject to unanticipated conditions. Unless and until such antitrust clearance is obtained, including expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period (or extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, our JUUL shares will not have voting rights and we will not be entitled to certain other rights, including the right to appoint any directors to the JUUL Board of Directors. Accordingly, failure to obtain antitrust clearance would adversely affect us, including because it would substantially limit our rights with respect to our investment in JUUL and would prevent us from accounting for our investment in JUUL using the equity method.\nIn addition, regardless of whether antitrust clearance is obtained, the expected benefits of the JUUL transaction, such as any equity earnings and receipt of cash dividends, may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe or at all, including due to the risks encountered by JUUL in its business, such as operational risks and regulatory risks at the international, federal and state levels, including actions by the FDA; unanticipated impacts on JUUL\u2019s relationships with employees, customers, suppliers and other third parties; potential disruptions to JUUL\u2019s management or current or future plans and operations due to the JUUL transaction; or domestic or international litigation developments, investigations, or otherwise. See Item 7. Tobacco Space - Business Environment for a discussion of certain FDA-related regulatory risks applicable to the e-vapor category. Failure to realize the expected benefits of our JUUL investment could adversely affect the value of the investment. As discussed in the Discussion and Analysis - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Item 7, if a qualitative assessment of impairment of our JUUL investment were to indicate that its fair value is less than its carrying value, the investment would be written down to its fair value, which could have a material adverse effect on Altria\u2019s consolidated financial position or earnings.\nOur investment in JUUL includes non-competition, standstill and transfer restrictions that prevent us from gaining control of JUUL. Furthermore, if our percentage ownership in JUUL were to decrease below certain levels, we would lose certain of our governance, consent, preemptive and other rights with respect to our investment in JUUL and may be unable to account for the investment under the equity method.\nThe shares of JUUL we hold generally cannot be sold or otherwise transferred for a six-year period that expires on December 20, 2024, subject to limited exceptions. We have also generally agreed not to compete with JUUL in the e-vapor space\nfor at least six years, which may be extended at our election. In addition, following receipt of antitrust clearance, our designees will comprise no more than one third of the members of the JUUL Board of Directors. As a result, JUUL\u2019s strategy and its material decisions are not controlled by us, and the terms of our agreements with JUUL mean that we are required to bear the risks associated with our investment in JUUL for at least a six-year period. Further, in the event that our ownership percentage in JUUL were to decrease below certain levels due to transfers by us or otherwise, or if we elect not to extend our non-competition obligations beyond six years, we would lose some or all of our board designation rights, preemptive rights, consent rights and other rights with respect to our investment in JUUL. Loss of these rights could adversely affect us by impairing our ability to influence JUUL and may prevent us from accounting for our investment under the equity method.\nOur proposed investment in Cronos may not be completed within the anticipated timeframe or at all, and the expected benefits of the Cronos transaction may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe or at all.\nOn December 7, 2018, we agreed to acquire common shares representing a 45% equity interest in Cronos and a warrant to acquire common shares representing an additional 10% equity interest in Cronos. The proposed transaction is subject to a number of closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approval, which may take longer than expected. We cannot provide any assurance that the proposed transaction will be completed or that there will not be a delay in the completion of the proposed transaction. There can also be no assurance that, if we complete the Cronos transaction, we will be able to realize its expected benefits, including due to the risks encountered by Cronos in its business, such as operational risks and legal and regulatory risks at the international, federal and state levels; unanticipated impacts on Cronos\u2019s relationships with third parties, its management, or its current or future plans and operations due to the Cronos transaction; or domestic or international litigation developments, investigations, or otherwise.", "PERMNO": 13901, "SIC": 2111, "TIC": "MO"}
