{"cik": "887359", "company": "Vericel Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and trading price of our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. There may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not known to us or that we do not consider to be material at this time. If the events described in these risks occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would likely suffer.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe have incurred losses, anticipate continuing to incur losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability for some time or at all.\nWe have incurred net losses each year since our inception in 1989, including net losses of $16.3 million and $19.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had accumulated a deficit of approximately $324.0 million and had $14.6 million of cash. Based on our current plan and cash on hand, we believe that we are well positioned to sustain our operations until we achieve profitability.\nAlthough we believe we will achieve profitability without the need to raise additional capital, we may continue to incur significant operating losses over the next several years despite sales increasing and margins improving, due to continuing expenses related to our research and development programs, and the expense associated with continuing the commercialization of our approved products and completing the development of our product candidates. We cannot predict with any certainty the amount of future losses. Our ability to maintain profitability will depend on, among other things, increasing sales of our current products, improving gross margins, successfully commercializing our new products, completing the development of our product candidates, timely initiation and completion of clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, establishing manufacturing, sales and marketing arrangements with third parties, maintaining supplies of key manufacturing components and the possible acquisition and development of complementary products. Therefore, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.\nIn the longer term, we may need to raise additional funds in order to continue to complete product development programs and complete clinical trials needed to obtain approval for and commercialize our current product candidates or to capitalize on potential strategic opportunities. We cannot be certain that actual results will not differ materially from our current projections and that current capital will be sufficient to achieve profitability nor that funding will be available on favorable terms, if at all. Some of the factors that will impact our ability to raise additional capital and our overall success include:\n\u2022\nThe rate and degree of progress of our product development;\n\u2022\ntThe ability to maintain our manufacturing facility's compliance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements including establishment and license fees;\n\u2022\nThe rate of regulatory approval to proceed with clinical development programs;\n\u2022\nThe level of success achieved in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nThe requirements to maintain marketing authorization and licenses from regulatory bodies in the United States and other countries in good standing;\n\u2022\nThe liquidity and market volatility of our equity securities;\n\u2022\nRegulatory and manufacturing requirements and uncertainties; and\n\u2022\nStaying ahead of technological developments by competitors.\nWhile we have access to certain amounts of financing through a loan and security agreement (Loan and Security Agreement) that we entered into with Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in March 2016 (SVB Facility), an agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (Lincoln Park), and an at-the-market sales agreement (ATM) with MLV & Co., LLC (MLV) (formerly McNicoll, Lewis & Vlak) there are certain factors, such as volume of trading in our common stock and our stock price and the ability to terminate the agreement with notice, which limit the amount that can be raised in a short period of time through these agreements with Lincoln Park and the ATM. In addition there are limits to our borrowing level with SVB based on financial ratios and accounts receivable balance. If funding is needed and we cannot raise such funds, we will not be able to develop, manufacture or enhance products, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to raise the required capital to conduct our operations, develop and commercialize our product candidates and otherwise grow and expand our business.\nNotwithstanding the net proceeds of approximately $37.5 million we received from our September 2014 public offering and the availability of funds under the SVB Facility, we will require substantial additional capital resources to complete the development of ixmyelocel-T for the treatment of advanced heart failure due to ischemic DCM and potentially for other strategic opportunities.\nIn order to grow and expand our business, to introduce other new product candidates into the marketplace, we may need to raise additional funds. We may also need significant additional funds or a collaborative partner, or both, to finance the research and development activities of our cell therapy product candidates for additional indications or in additional markets.\nOur future capital requirements will depend upon many factors, including:\n\u2022Continued scientific progress in our research, clinical and development programs;\n\u2022Costs and timing of conducting clinical trials and seeking regulatory approvals;\n\u2022Competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022Avoiding infringement and misappropriation of third-party intellectual property;\n\u2022Obtaining valid and enforceable patents that give us a competitive advantage;\n\u2022Our ability to establish additional collaborative relationships;\n\u2022Our ability to scale up our production capabilities for larger quantities of our products;\n\u2022The effect of commercialization activities and facility expansions, if and as required; and\n\u2022Complementary business acquisitions or development opportunities.\nWe may direct Lincoln Park to purchase up to $15 million worth of shares of our common stock over a 30-month period generally in amounts up to 50,000 shares of our common stock on certain business days under a Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement) we entered into with Lincoln Park on January 21, 2014 (the Lincoln Park Equity Line). As of December 31, 2015, we had sold $3.7 million worth of shares to Lincoln Park under this purchase agreement. However, there are certain factors, such as volume of trading in our common stock and our stock price, which limit the amount that can be raised in a short period of time. The extent to which we rely on the Lincoln Park Equity Line as sources of funding will depend on a number of factors, including the prevailing market price of our common stock and the extent to which we are able to secure working capital from other sources. If obtaining sufficient funding from Lincoln Park were to prove impracticable or prohibitively dilutive, we may need to secure other sources of funding in order to satisfy our working capital needs. Even if we sell the maximum amount we are eligible to sell to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement, we may need additional capital to fully implement our business, operating and development plans. Should the financing we require to sustain our working capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive should we require it, the consequences may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. Additionally, during the year ended December 2014, we raised net proceeds of $7.1 million utilizing our ATM with MLV. The ATM, which as of December 31, 2015 had remaining capacity of approximately $7.8 million, allowed us to sell our common stock from time to time under a registration statement on Form S-3 filed in June 2011, pursuant to which we registered $100 million of our securities for public sale. The Form S-3 registration statement filed in June 2011 expired in July 2014. If we choose to access the remaining capacity, we will file a new Form S-3 registration statement.\nWe may try to access the public or private equity markets if conditions are favorable to complete a financing, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time, or whenever we require additional operating capital. In addition, we may seek collaborative relationships, incur debt and access other available funding sources. This additional funding may not be available to us on reasonable terms, or at all. Some of the factors that will impact our ability to raise additional capital and our overall success include:\n\u2022\nOur ability to further commercialize our products;\n\u2022\nThe rate and degree of progress of our product development;\n\u2022\nThe rate of regulatory approval to proceed with clinical developmental programs;\n\u2022\nThe level of success achieved in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nThe requirements for marketing authorization from regulatory bodies in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022\nThe liquidity and market volatility of our equity securities; and\n\u2022\nRegulatory and manufacturing requirements and uncertainties, and technological developments by competitors.\nIf adequate funds are not available in the future, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements and we may be required to delay or terminate research and development programs, curtail capital expenditures, and reduce business development and other operating activities, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals would severely limit our ability to sell our products.\nWe must maintain our domestic regulatory approvals to continue to commercialize our products. We must demonstrate the safety, purity and potency, or efficacy, of cell therapy products to obtain FDA regulatory approval prior to marketing in the United States or other countries. Demonstration of safety and efficacy requires the conduct of nonclinical studies and well-controlled clinical trials in compliance with FDA, ICH (International Conference of Harmonization) and applicable local regulations. The FDA regulatory review process to obtain marketing approval is a rigorous process that requires demonstrating the ability to manufacture the product in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) in addition to demonstrating a favorable risk/benefit profile. Regulatory requirements outside the U.S. often require additional studies and data to obtain registration. Timelines can also be longer than those in the U.S. We must maintain our domestic and foreign regulatory approvals in compliance with FDA regulatory requirements and applicable local regulations to allow for continued commercialization. The safety, potency and purity of our products must be monitored to be in compliance with FDA requirements for safety, cGMP, and all other applicable regulations. This requires adverse event monitoring and reporting to regulatory agencies, as well as submission and approval of any changes in the manufacturing process. Our manufacturing and testing facilities are subject to FDA periodic inspections for compliance with cGMP requirements. Failure to meet regulatory requirements and maintain cGMP compliance could result in severe and detrimental regulatory actions.\nAny changes in the regulatory requirements that affect our products and/or product candidates could prevent, limit or delay our ability to market or develop new product candidates.\nFDA regulations establish the regulatory requirements for drugs, devices and biological products. Our cell therapy products are regulated as devices or biologics under current regulations. Biologics require Biologics License Application (BLA) approval in the U.S. prior to being marketed. The regulations and guidance that govern the approval of biological products for marketing in the U.S. are subject to review and change by the FDA and could have an adverse impact on our ability to continue to market our products and bring new products to the market.\nOur product candidate, ixmyelocel-T, still needs to initiate and then successfully complete pivotal Phase 3 studies. If we do not successfully continue or complete the clinical development of ixmyelocel-T and MACI, and achieve regulatory approval, our ability to finance our operations may be adversely impacted.\nOur near-term prospects depend in part upon our ability to successfully continue and complete clinical development of our product candidates, ixmyelocel-T and MACI, demonstrating adequate safety and effectiveness to obtain regulatory approval in the U.S. The ongoing Phase 2b ixCELL DCM clinical trial is evaluating patients who have been treated with ixmylocel-T. Our ability to finance our company and to generate revenues will depend on the results of the ongoing and planned clinical studies required to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of ixmyelocel-T to secure marketing authorization and to secure marketing authorization for MACI. Ixmyelocel-T and MACI each could be unsuccessful if it:\n\u2022\nDoes not demonstrate acceptable safety and efficacy in clinical trials, or otherwise does not meet applicable regulatory requirements for regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nDoes not offer sufficient, clinically meaningful therapeutic benefit over the standard of care/ existing therapies;\n\u2022\nCannot be produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable costs;\n\u2022\nIs not accepted as a safe, efficacious, and cost-effective treatment over the standard of care and/or current therapies by the medical community and third-party payers.\nIf the development or commercialization of ixmyelocel-T or MACI is not successful or is significantly delayed, our financial condition and future prospects may be adversely impacted, which could cause us to have substantial difficulties raising the additional capital required to fund our business.\nOur products and product development programs are based on novel technologies and are inherently risky.\nOur products are subject to the inherent risks of failure associated with the development of new products based on novel technologies. The innovative nature of our therapeutics creates significant challenges in regard to product development and optimization, manufacturing, regulatory environment and emerging regulations, third-party reimbursement and market acceptance. Therapeutic advancements are generally ahead of development and release of regulatory guidance and requirements. The lack of established precedents and evolving regulatory policy for novel products can pose significant challenges in product and clinical development, which can decrease the chances of regulatory success.\nFurther, when manufacturing autologous cell therapies, the number and the composition of the cell population varies from patient to patient, in part due to the age of the patient, since the therapy is dependent on patient-specific physiology. Such variability in the number and composition of these cells could adversely affect our ability to manufacture autologous cell therapies in a cost-effective manner and meet acceptable product release specifications for use in a clinical trial or, if approved, for commercial sale.\nAs a consequence, the development and regulatory approval process for autologous cell therapy products could be delayed or may never be completed.\nOur products represent new classes of therapy that the marketplace may not understand or accept. Furthermore, the success of our products is dependent on wider acceptance by the medical community.\nWhile our acquired products have had some commercial success to date, the broader market may not understand or accept our products. Our products represent new treatments or therapies and compete with a number of more conventional products and therapies manufactured and marketed by others. The new nature of our products creates significant challenges in regards to product development and optimization, manufacturing, regulations, and third-party reimbursement. As a result, the commercialization of our current products and the development pathway for our potential new products may be subject to increased scrutiny, as compared to the pathway for more conventional products.\nThe degree of market acceptance of any of our marketed or potential new products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nThe clinical safety and effectiveness of our products and their demonstrated advantage over alternative treatment methods;\n\u2022\nOur ability to demonstrate to healthcare providers that our products provide a therapeutic advancement over standard of care or other competitive products / methods;\n\u2022\nOur ability to educate healthcare providers on the autologous use of patient-specific human tissue, to avoid potential confusion with and differentiate ourselves from the ethical controversies associated with human fetal tissue and engineered human tissue;\n\u2022\nOur ability to educate healthcare providers, patients and payers on the safety and adverse reactions involving our products;\n\u2022\nOur ability to meet supply and demand and develop a core group of medical professionals familiar with and committed to the use of our products; and\n\u2022The cost-effectiveness of our products and the reimbursement policies of government and third-party payers.\nIf the medical community or patients do not accept the safety and effectiveness of our products or if our products fail to demonstrate a favorable risk/benefit profile, it could negatively affect our sales, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operations. While acceptance by the medical community may be fostered by broad evaluation via peer-reviewed literature, we may not have the resources to facilitate additional research that can result in additional scientific publications.\nOur inability to complete our product development activities successfully would materially limit our ability to operate or finance our operations.\nIn order to obtain regulatory approval to commercialize our cell product in the United States, we must conduct adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness in compliance with current regulatory requirements. We may not be able to successfully complete the development of our product candidates, or successfully market our technologies or product candidates. We, and any of our potential collaborators, may encounter problems and delays relating to research and development, regulatory approval and intellectual property rights of our technologies and product candidates. Our research and development programs may not be successful, and our cell culture technologies and product candidates may not facilitate the production of cells outside the human body with the expected results. Our technologies and cell product candidates may not prove to be safe and effective in clinical trials, and we may not obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for our product candidates. If any of these events occur, we may not have adequate resources to continue operations for the period required to resolve any issues delaying commercialization and we may not be able to raise capital to finance our continued operations during the period required for resolution of any such issues.\nWe must successfully complete our nonclinical and clinical development program to be able to demonstrate safety and efficacy to seek marketing approval of our cell therapy product candidates. Lack of efficacy and or safety events can lead to the discontinuation of clinical development, and this can occur at any stage of the clinical development program. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during development that can delay or prevent commercialization of our development candidates.\nThe results of early stage clinical trials do not ensure success in later clinical trials, and interim results are not necessarily predictive of final results.\nWith respect to any clinical trials affecting our products or development candidates, failures or delays can occur at any stage of the trials, and may be directly or indirectly caused by a variety of factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nDelays in securing clinical investigators or trial sites for our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nDelays in obtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) and other regulatory approvals to commence a clinical trial;\n\u2022\nSlower than anticipated rates of patient recruitment and enrollment in our clinical trials, or failing to reach the targeted number of patients due to competition for patients from other trials;\n\u2022\nLimited or no availability of coverage, reimbursement and adequate payment from health maintenance organizations and other third party payers for the use of biological products supplied for use in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nNegative or inconclusive results from clinical trials;\n\u2022\nUnforeseen adverse effects interrupting, delaying, or halting clinical trials of any future therapeutic product candidates, and possibly resulting in the FDA or other regulatory authorities denying approval of any future therapeutic product candidates;\n\u2022\nUnforeseen safety issues;\n\u2022\nApproval and introduction of new therapies or changes in standards of practice or regulatory requirements or guidance that render our clinical trial endpoints or the targeting of our proposed indications obsolete;\n\u2022\nInability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment or problems with investigator or patient compliance with the trial protocols;\n\u2022\nInability to replicate in large controlled trials safety and efficacy data obtained from a limited number of patients in uncontrolled trials;\n\u2022\nInability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols; and\n\u2022\nUnavailability of clinical trial supplies.\nThe FDA and the sponsor monitor the progress of clinical trials and they may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time due to patient safety or other considerations. The FDA may impose a clinical hold on our trials because of safety concerns that have arisen for products or product candidates that are similar to our product candidates.\nOur research programs are currently directed at improving product functionality for certain clinical indications, improving product shelf life, and decreasing the cost of manufacturing our products. These production process changes may alter the functionality of our cells and require various additional levels of experimental and clinical testing and evaluation. Any such testing could lengthen the time before these products would be commercially available.\nEven when successful clinical results are reported for a product from a completed clinical trial, the durability of response may not be sustained over time, or may not be sufficient to support regulatory approval.\nWe may rely on third parties to conduct some of our clinical trials, and their failure to perform their obligations in a timely or competent manner may delay development and/or impact commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe may use clinical research organizations (CROs) to assist in the conduct of our clinical trials. There are numerous alternative sources to provide these services. However, we may face delays outside of our control if these parties do not perform their obligations in a timely or competent fashion, or if we are forced to change service providers. Any third party that we hire to conduct clinical trials may also provide services to our competitors, which could compromise the performance of their obligations to us. If we experience significant delays in the progress of our clinical trials, the commercial prospects for product candidates could be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue would be delayed or prevented. In addition, we and any provider that we retain will be subject to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements. If GCP and other regulatory requirements are not adhered to by us or our third-party providers, the conduct of the trial may be compromised and the development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed or approval may never be obtained.\nAny failure of such CRO to successfully accomplish clinical trial monitoring, data collection, safety monitoring and data management and the other services it provides for us in a timely manner and in compliance with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our ability to utilize the trial to obtain regulatory approval or complete clinical development of our products to support regulatory approval. Problems with the timeliness or quality of the work of a CRO may lead us to seek to terminate the relationship and use an alternate service provider. However, making such changes may be costly and may delay our trials, and contractual restrictions may make such a change difficult or impossible. Additionally, it may be difficult to find a replacement organization that can conduct our trials in an acceptable manner and at an acceptable cost.\nFailure of third parties, including Vention Medical, Sanofi or Matricel GmbH, to manufacture or supply certain components, equipment, disposable devices and other materials used in our ixmyelocel-T, Epicel and MACI cell manufacturing processes would impair our cell product development.\nWe rely on third parties, including Vention Medical, Inc. (Vention), Sanofi and Matricel GmbH (Matricel) to manufacture and/or supply certain of our devices/manufacturing equipment and to manufacture and/or supply certain components, equipment, disposable devices and other materials used in our cell manufacturing process to develop our marketed cell therapy products and\nour product candidates. In many instances these third parties serve as our sole suppliers. For example, Vention is the sole supplier for the cell cassettes used in the ixmyelocel-T manufacturing process; Sanofi is the sole supplier of 3t3 cells for Epicel; and Matricel is the sole supplier of the membrane for MACI. In each case it would be difficult to obtain alternate sources of supply on a short-term basis. If any of our manufacturers or suppliers fails to perform its respective obligations, or if our supply of certain components, equipment, disposable devices and other materials is limited or interrupted, it could impair our ability to manufacture our products, which would delay our ability to conduct our clinical trials or market our product candidates on a timely and cost-competitive basis, if at all.\nIn addition, we may not be able to continue our present arrangements with our suppliers, supplement existing relationships, establish and maintain new relationships or be able to identify and obtain the ancillary materials that are necessary to develop our product candidates in the future. Our dependence upon third parties for the supply and manufacture of these items could adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver commercially feasible products on a timely and competitive basis.\nFailure by our third-party manufacturers, including Vention and Matricel, to comply with the regulatory requirements set forth by the FDA with respect to our products could delay or prevent the completion of clinical trials, the approval of any product candidates or the commercialization of our products.\nThird-party manufacturers, such as Vention and Matricel, must be inspected by the FDA for current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, compliance, as well as for their ability to manufacture the product in compliance with the established process and procedure for the proposed new product during a pre-approval inspection. We may be in competition with other companies for access to these manufacturers\u2019 facilities and may be subject to delays in manufacture if the manufacturers give other clients higher priority than they give to us. If we are unable to secure and maintain third-party manufacturing capacity, the development and sales of our products and our financial performance may be materially affected.\nManufacturers are obligated to operate in accordance with FDA-mandated requirements. A failure of any of our third-party manufacturers to establish and follow cGMP requirements and to document their adherence to such practices may lead to significant delays in the availability of material for clinical trials, may delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our products, and may cause delays or interruptions in the availability of our products for commercial distribution following FDA approval. This could result in higher costs to us or deprive us of potential product revenues.\nComplying with cGMP and non-U.S. regulatory requirements will require that we expend time, money, and effort in production, recordkeeping, and quality control to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements. We, or our contracted manufacturing facility, must also pass a pre-approval inspection prior to FDA approval. Failure to pass a pre-approval inspection may significantly delay FDA approval of our products. Failure to comply with cGMP requirements, can result in regulatory action that can limit the ability to manufacture commercial products. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nThe manufacture of cell therapy products is characterized by inherent risks and challenges and has proven to be a costly endeavor relative to manufacturing other therapeutic products.\nThe manufacture of cell therapy products, such as our products and product candidates, is highly complex and is characterized by inherent risks and challenges such as autologous raw material inconsistencies, logistical challenges, significant quality control and assurance requirements, manufacturing complexity, and significant manual processing. Unlike products that rely on chemicals for efficacy, such as most pharmaceuticals, cell therapy products are difficult to characterize due to the inherent variability of biological input materials. Difficulty in characterizing biological materials or their interactions creates greater risk in the manufacturing process. We attempt to mitigate risk associated with the manufacture of biologics by continuing to improve the characterization of all of our input materials, utilizing multiple vendors for supply of qualified biological materials, and manufacturing some of these materials ourselves. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that biological materials that we maintain in inventory will yield finished products that satisfy applicable product release criteria. Our inability to obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture cell therapy products that incorporate such materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that we or any third-party contractors with whom we enter into strategic relationships will be successful in streamlining manufacturing operations and implementing efficient, low-cost manufacturing capabilities and processes that will enable us to meet the quality, price and production standards or production volumes to achieve profitability. Our failure to develop these manufacturing processes in a timely manner could prevent us from achieving our growth and profitability objectives as projected or at all.\nWe have limited manufacturing capacity and our commercial manufacturing operations in the U.S. depend on one facility. Similarly, manufacturing of our lead product candidate, ixmyelocel-T, is conducted at one facility. If either facility is destroyed or we experience any manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays, this could limit supply of our products or adversely affect our ability to conduct our clinical trials and our business would be adversely impacted.\nWe presently conduct all of our commercial manufacturing operations in the U.S. at one facility located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. As a result, all of the commercial manufacturing of our marketed products, Epicel and Carticel, for the U.S. market takes place at a single U.S. facility. In addition, clinical trials for certain product candidates would primarily depend upon the manufacturing of such product candidates in the same Cambridge facility. Similarly, manufacturing of our product candidate ixmyelocel-T takes place at one facility located in Ann Arbor, Michigan. If regulatory, manufacturing or other problems require us to discontinue production at either facility, we will not be able to supply our products to our patients or have supplies for any clinical trials, which would adversely impact our business. If either facility or the equipment in it is significantly damaged or destroyed by fire, flood, power loss or similar events, we may not be able to quickly or inexpensively replace our manufacturing capacity or replace our facility at all. In the event of a temporary or protracted loss of this facility or equipment, we might not be able to transfer manufacturing to a third party. Even if we could transfer manufacturing from one facility to the other or to a third party, the shift would likely be expensive and time-consuming, particularly since an alternative facility would need to comply with the applicable regulatory and quality standard requirements whereby validation and FDA approval would be required before any products manufactured at that facility could be made commercially available.\nWhile we do maintain insurance coverage against damage to our property and equipment, if we have underestimated our insurance needs, we will not have sufficient insurance to cover losses above and beyond the limits on our policies.\nWe are subject to significant regulation with respect to the manufacturing of our products.\nAll of those involved in the preparation of a cellular therapy for clinical trials or commercial sale, including our existing supply contract manufacturers and clinical trial investigators, are subject to extensive and continuing government regulations by the FDA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions. Components of a finished therapeutic product approved for commercial sale or used in late-stage clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP. These regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of investigational products and products approved for sale. Our facilities and quality systems and the facilities and quality systems of some or all of our third party contractors and suppliers are subject to pre-approval and routine FDA inspections for compliance with the applicable regulations as a condition of FDA approval of our products.\nOur manufacturing facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts was inspected by the FDA in 2014. On March 19, 2014, the FDA issued a Form 483 List of Inspectional Observations. A Form 483 is issued when, in an investigator\u2019s judgment, the observed conditions or practices observed during an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility indicate that an FDA-regulated product may be in violation of FDA\u2019s requirements. We have completed remedial measures to improve our manufacturing process and have responded to all FDA observations. Generally, if any such inspection or audit identifies a failure to comply with applicable regulations or if a violation of our product specifications or applicable regulation occurs independent of such an inspection or audit, we or the FDA may require remedial measures that may be costly and/or time consuming for us or a third party to implement and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical trial or commercial sales, recalls, warning letters, market withdrawals, seizures or the temporary or permanent closure of a facility. Any such remedial measures imposed upon us or third parties with whom we contract could materially harm our business.\nWe could incur significant costs complying with environmental and health and safety requirements, or as a result of liability for contamination or other harm caused by hazardous materials that we use.\nOur research and development and manufacturing processes involve the use of hazardous materials. We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental requirements, including regulations governing the use, manufacture, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, discharge to air and water, the cleanup of contamination and occupational health and safety matters. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials, and we may incur liability as a result of any contamination or injury. Under some environmental laws and regulations, we could also be held responsible for costs relating to any contamination at our past or present facilities and at third party waste disposal sites where we have sent wastes. These could include costs relating to contamination that did not result from any violation of law, and in some circumstances, contamination that we did not cause. We may incur significant expenses in the future relating to any failure to comply with environmental laws. Any such future expenses or liability could have a significant negative impact on our financial condition. The enactment of stricter laws or regulations, the stricter interpretation of existing laws and regulations or the requirement to undertake the investigation or remediation of currently unknown environmental contamination at our own or third party sites may require us to make additional expenditures, which could be material.\nIn order to obtain marketing authorization of any of our cell therapy product candidates, including MACI and ixmyelocel-T, in the United States, the FDA requires us to submit a BLA, which is subject to the agency\u2019s detailed review.\nThe Biologics License Application (BLA) is a request for permission to introduce, or deliver for introduction, a biologic product into interstate commerce in the U.S. MACI (matrix applied characterized autologous cultured chondrocytes) and ixmyelocel-T are subject to the FDA\u2019s biological product requirements. A BLA was submitted on January 4, 2016, and subsequently accepted for review by the FDA for MACI on March 4, 2016. The FDA will have 10 months per the timelines set forth under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), to review the application for compliance with the requirements set forth in Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). The approvability of the BLA is based on the acceptability of the results of a single clinical study conducted outside the United States to meet the safety and effectiveness requirements for approval, and the acceptability of foreign data. The Cambridge manufacturing facility will also be subject to a pre-approval inspection to demonstrate the capabilities to manufacture the product under cGMP requirements in compliance with the procedures provided in the BLA. MACI is considered a combination product consisting of the autologous cultured chondrocytes (the cell product) and ACI-Maix membrane (the device). The ACI-Maix membrane is manufactured by Matricel. Matricel will also be subject to an FDA pre-approval inspection in connection with the BLA review and approval. A filing fee of $2.4 million was paid to the FDA for review of the application. If the application is not filed, and a Refuse to File letter is received, 25% of the filing fee will be forfeited. There are risks with respect to the review of the MACI BLA. A second study may be required to secure regulatory approval or as a post-marketing commitment. This can result in additional time to market and/or additional cost. The MACI regulatory approval in the U.S. will be associated with a commitment to conduct a pediatric clinical study in the U.S. The conduct of this study will require funding and resources. This will be a post-approval commitment. If not met the product may be withdrawn from the market by FDA.\nOur business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows could be significantly and negatively affected by substantial governmental regulations.\nOur products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. Overall, there appears to be a trend toward more stringent regulation worldwide, and we do not anticipate this trend to dissipate in the near future.\nIn general, the development, testing, labeling, manufacturing and marketing of our products are subject to extensive regulation and review by numerous governmental authorities both in the United States and abroad. The regulatory process requires the expenditure of significant time, effort and expense to bring new products to market. For example, the FDA approved Epicel as a HUD pursuant to an HDE application. A HUD is a medical device intended to benefit patients in the treatment or diagnosis of a disease or condition that affects fewer than 4,000 individuals in the United States per year. A HUD with an approved HDE is approved by the FDA for marketing. However, Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval is required before a HUD can be used at a facility, with the exception of emergency use. The HDE holder is responsible for ensuring that a HUD approved under an HDE is administered only in facilities having an IRB constituted and acting in accordance with the agency\u2019s regulation governing IRBs, including continuing review of use of the device. HUDs are also subject to additional FDA requirements, such as adverse event reporting and the submission of updated information on a periodic basis to demonstrate that the HUD designation is still valid. Failure to meet FDA requirements pertaining to a HUD could result in the suspension or revocation of the HDE.\nIf the HDE is suspended or revoked, marketing approval for Epicel would require the submission and approval of a premarket approval application (PMA) in order to be made commercially available. The PMA process is costly, lengthy and uncertain. A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data, to demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device for its intended use. If the HDE approval for Epicel was withdrawn, and we were unable to obtain approval of a PMA, we could not market Epicel for sale in the U.S.\nWe are also required to implement and maintain stringent reporting, labeling and record keeping procedures. More specifically, in the United States, both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. Compliance with the FDA\u2019s requirements, including the FDA\u2019s cGMP recordkeeping regulations, labeling and promotional requirements and adverse event reporting regulations, is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA. Our failure to comply with U.S. federal, state and foreign governmental regulations could lead to the issuance of warning letters or untitled letters, the imposition of injunctions, suspensions or loss of regulatory approvals, product recalls, termination of distribution, product seizures or civil penalties. In the most extreme cases, criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facility are possible.\nIn addition, the pharmaceutical, biologic and medical device industries also are subject to many complex laws and regulations governing Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and targeting healthcare fraud and abuse, with these laws and regulations being subject to interpretation. In many instances, the industry does not have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation\nof these laws and regulations. In certain public statements, governmental authorities have taken positions on issues for which little official interpretation was previously available. Some of these positions appear to be inconsistent with common practices within the industry but have not previously been challenged.\nVarious federal and state agencies have become increasingly vigilant in recent years in their investigation of various business practices, such as the federal Anti-kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act. Governmental and regulatory actions against us can result in various actions that could adversely impact our operations, including:\n\u2022\nThe recall or seizure of products;\n\u2022\nThe suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the production or sale of a product;\n\u2022\nThe suspension of shipments from particular manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022\nThe imposition of fines and penalties;\n\u2022\nThe delay of our ability to introduce new products into the market;\n\u2022\nOur exclusion or the exclusion of our products from being reimbursed by federal and state healthcare programs (such as Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration, or VA, health programs and Civilian Health and Medical Program Uniformed Service, or CHAMPUS); and\n\u2022\nOther civil or criminal prosecution or sanctions against us or our employees, such as fines, penalties or imprisonment.\nAny of these actions, in combination or alone, or even a public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of these laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Sunset Clause provided under European Union (EU) pharmaceutical legislation, requires Marketing Authorization Holders (MAH) in the EU to place the product on the market within 3 years from the date of granting of the authorization. Otherwise, the authorization will cease to be valid. Likewise, for a product that was previously placed on the market and is no longer actually present on the market for 3 consecutive years from the last day of distribution, the authorization will cease to be valid. The rules have been the subject of interpretation by European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Commission to mean that the marketing authorization of a medicinal product will remain valid if at least one presentation of the existing product presentations is placed on the market in at least one Member State of the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA). In the case of MACI, this means that Vericel has 3 years from the date of last distribution to make the product available in at least one Member State of the EU/EEA. In order to resume product supply in the EU/EEA, this will require the registration, qualification and approval of an EU compliant cGMP manufacturing facility within the allotted timeframe. In addition, Vericel must comply with the Pediatric Investigational Plan (PIP) that is in place as a post-authorization commitment agreed with the EMA. The current PIP requires Vericel to submit the results of the pediatric study prior to 2017 according to the study protocol previously agreed between the EMA and the previous sponsor. Unless the PIP commitment date is modified and unless Vericel decides to make investments to register and qualify its cGMP manufacturing facility in the EU for it to be approved, the marketing authorization for MACI could be at risk of being revoked under the prevailing EU law.\nIn the United States, if the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could ban such products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of payment of certain products, refuse to grant pending applications, refuse to provide certificates to foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also impose operating restrictions on a companywide basis, enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to our products and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees or us. The FDA may also recommend prosecution to the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). Adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products.\nIn many of the foreign countries in which our products are marketed, we are subject to regulations affecting, among other things, clinical efficacy, product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import/export restrictions, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. Many of the regulations applicable to our products in these countries, such as the Medicinal Products Directive and the ATMP guidelines, governing products in the EU, are similar to those of the FDA. In addition, in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed with the benefit of reimbursement eligibility. Failure to receive or delays in the receipt of relevant foreign qualifications also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs both the U.S. and foreign government regulators have become increasingly stringent, we may be subject to more rigorous regulation by governmental authorities in the future. Our products and our operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial\nstandards bodies, such as the International Standards Organization, or ISO. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our business will be harmed.\nChanges to our products or product candidates may require regulatory approvals. It may be necessary to recall or cease marketing our products until certain issues are resolved and regulatory approval is obtained.\nChanges or modifications in the manufacturing process may require the submission of supplements to our BLAs, Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) application, and Investigational New Drug applications (INDs). These supplements require the generation of data to support the change, review and approval by FDA to obtain authorization for the change in the commercial product or in the investigational biological product before they can be implemented. Obtaining regulatory approvals for these changes may require the conduct of new studies and purchase of new equipment to justify the change. This can be costly and time consuming. Regulatory delays can adversely impact our ability to improve our products and to introduce new products in a timely manner. This can be detrimental to our future growth.\nIf we or our suppliers fail to comply with ongoing FDA or other foreign regulatory authority requirements, or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, these products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market.\nThe manufacturing processes, reporting requirements, post-approval clinical data and promotional activities for each of our products is subject to continued regulatory reporting and periodic inspections by the FDA, as well as other domestic and foreign regulatory agencies. In particular, we and our suppliers are required to comply with cGMP and Good Tissue Practice (GTP) regulations for the manufacture of our products and other regulations which include, methods and documentation of production controls, labeling, packaging, storage and shipment of any product to name a few. Regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, enforce the cGMP, GTP and other regulations through periodic inspections and reporting. For example, the holder of an approved BLA or HUD is obligated to monitor and report adverse events, and product failures, including critical deviations and lack of efficacy. A BLA or HDE device holder must maintain regulatory compliance for all aspects of the applicable regulations or can be subject to regulatory action, including recall or withdrawal from the market.\nProduct manufacturers and their facilities are subject to payment of annual user fees and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory agencies for compliance with cGMP and other applicable regulations. If at any time we or a regulatory agency discovers a previously unknown safety concern with a product, such as a serious adverse event of unanticipated severity or frequency that cannot be adequately manage and changes the risk-benefit profile of the product, or there are problems with the facility where the product is manufactured; a regulatory agency may impose restrictions relative to that product or the manufacturing facility, including suspension of manufacturing recall or withdrawal of the product from the market.\nAdvertising and promotional materials, including educational and web-site material, must comply with FDA\u2019s promotional and advertising regulations in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws, and such materials for biologics are subject to submission and review by the Center of Biological Research (CBER), Promotional Advertising Labeling Branch (PALB).\nThe failure by us or one of our suppliers to comply with applicable legal statutes and regulations administered by the FDA and other regulatory agencies, or the failure to timely and adequately respond to any adverse inspectional or review observations, or product safety issues, could result in, among other things, any of the following enforcement actions:\n\u2022\nUntitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u2022\nUnanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions;\n\u2022\nClient notifications for repair, replacement, or refunds of a device;\n\u2022\nRecall, detention or seizure of our products;\n\u2022\nOperating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022\nDenying, refusing or delaying our requests for approval of new products or proposed changes to existing products;\n\u2022\nOperating restrictions;\n\u2022\nWithdrawing product approvals that have already been granted;\n\u2022\nRefusal to approve a pending marketing application, such as a BLA or supplements to a BLA submitted by us;\n\u2022\nRefusal to grant export approval for our products; or\n\u2022\nCriminal prosecution.\nIf any of these actions were to occur it would harm our reputation and cause our product sales and profitability to suffer, preventing us from generating revenue. Furthermore, our key suppliers may have compliance issues which could impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis and in the required quantities.\nOur marketed products may be used by physicians for indications that are not approved by the FDA. If the FDA finds that we marketed our products in a manner that promoted off-label use, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\nUnder the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) and other laws, we are prohibited from promoting our products for off-label uses. This means, for example, that we may not make claims about the use of any of our marketed products, including Carticel or Epicel, outside of their approved labeling and indications. Therefore, we may not proactively discuss or provide information on off-label uses. The FDA does not, however, restrict physicians from prescribing products for off-label uses in the practice of medicine. Should the FDA determine that our activities constitute the promotion of off-label uses, the FDA could bring an action to prevent us from distributing Carticel or Epicel for the off-label use and could impose fines and penalties on us and our executives. In addition, failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising can result in, among other things, the FDA\u2019s refusal to approve a product, the suspension or withdrawal of an approved product from the market, product recalls, fines, disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecutions.\nIf the Office of Inspector General within the Department of Health and Human Services, the DOJ, or another federal or state agency determines that we have promoted off-label use of our products, we may be subject to various penalties, including civil or criminal penalties, and the off-label use of our products may result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business.\nIn addition to the FDA restrictions on our marketed products, several other types of state and federal healthcare laws have been applied by DOJ and state attorneys general to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. While physicians may prescribe products for off-label uses and indications, if other federal or state regulatory authorities determine that we have engaged in off-label promotion through remuneration, kickbacks or other monetary benefits to prescribers, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and could be prohibited from participating in government healthcare programs such as Medicaid and Medicare. In addition, government agencies or departments could conclude that we have engaged in off-label promotion and, potentially, caused the submission of false claims. Even if we are successful in resolving such matters without incurring penalties, responding to investigations or prosecutions will likely result in substantial costs and could significantly and adversely impact our reputation and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and ability to finance our operations. In addition, the off-label use of our products may increase the risk of injury to patients, and, in turn, the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert our management\u2019s attention and result in substantial damage awards against us.\nThe price and sale of any of our products may be limited by health insurance coverage and government regulation.\nMaintaining and growing sales of our products will depend in large part on the availability of adequate coverage and the extent to which third-party payers, including health insurance companies, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), and government health administration authorities such as Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care programs will pay for the cost of the products and related treatment. Hospitals and other healthcare provider clients that purchase our products typically bill various third-party payers to cover all or a portion of the costs and fees associated with the procedures in which such products are used, including the cost of the purchase of these products. Third-party payers are also increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by demanding price discounts or rebates and limiting both coverage and the amounts that they will pay for certain products, and, as a result, they may not cover or continue to provide adequate payment for our products. We might need to conduct post-marketing studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products and product candidates to such payers\u2019 satisfaction. Such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources. Our products and future products might not ultimately be considered cost-effective. Adequate third-party reimbursement might not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in our products and future product development. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available, reimbursement is available only to limited levels, or if our costs of production increase faster than increases in reimbursement levels, we may not be able to successfully grow the sales of our products or commercialize any product candidates for which marketing approval is obtained.\nCoverage decisions and payment amounts are established at the discretion of the individual third-party payer, and the regulations that govern pricing, coverage and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. Many private payers in the United States, however, use coverage decisions and payment amounts determined by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), as guidelines in setting their coverage and reimbursement policies. As the portion of the U.S. population over the age of 65 and eligible for Medicare continues to grow, we may be more vulnerable to coverage and reimbursement limitations imposed by CMS. While certain procedures using our products are currently covered by Medicare and other third-party payers, future action by CMS or other government agencies may diminish payments to physicians, outpatient centers and/or hospitals for covered services. As a result, we cannot be certain that the procedures performed with our products will be reimbursed at a cost-effective level or reimbursed at all.\nFurthermore, the healthcare industry in the United States has experienced a trend toward cost containment as government and private insurers seek to control healthcare costs by imposing lower payment rates and negotiating reduced contract rates with service providers. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the procedures performed with our products will be reimbursed at a cost-effective level. Nor can we be certain that third-party payers using a methodology that sets amounts based on the type of procedure performed, such as those utilized by Medicare and in many privately managed care systems, will view the cost of our products to be justified so as to incorporate such costs into the overall cost of the procedure. Moreover, we are unable to predict what changes will be made to the reimbursement methodologies used by third-party payers in the future.\nWe face intense competition in the markets targeted by our products. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do, and we expect that all of our products will face intense competition from existing or future products.\nAll of our products face intense competition from existing and future products marketed by large companies. These competitors may successfully market products that compete with our products, identify and bring to market new product candidates earlier than we do, or develop products that are more effective or less costly than our products. These competitive factors could require us to conduct substantial new research and development activities to establish new product targets, which would be costly and time consuming. These activities can adversely impact our ability to effectively commercialize products and achieve revenue and profits.\nIf we do not keep pace with our competitors and with technological and market changes, our products will become less attractive or obsolete and our business may suffer.\nThe markets for our products are highly competitive, subject to rapid technological changes, and vary for different candidates and processes that directly compete with our products. Our competitors in the medical and biotechnology industries may have superior products, research and development, manufacturing, and marketing capabilities, and financial resources or marketing positions. Furthermore, our competitors may have developed, or could in the future develop, new technologies that compete with our products or even render our products obsolete. As an example, in the past, published studies have suggested that hematopoietic stem cell therapy use for bone marrow transplantation, following marrow ablation due to chemotherapy, may have limited clinical benefit in the treatment of breast cancer, which was a significant portion of the overall hematopoietic stem cell transplant market. This resulted in the practical elimination of this market for our cell-based product for this application.\nOur cell manufacturing system for ixmyelocel-T is designed to improve and automate the processes for producing cells used in therapeutic procedures. Even if we are able to demonstrate improved or equivalent results, the cost or process of treatment and other factors may cause researchers and practitioners to not use our products and we could suffer a competitive disadvantage. To the extent that others develop new technologies that address the targeted application for our products, our business will suffer. Finally, if we are unable to continue to develop and market new products and technologies in a timely manner, the demand for our products may decrease or our products could become obsolete, and our revenue may decline.\nEthical, legal, social and other concerns surrounding the use of human tissue in synthetic biologically engineered products may negatively affect public perception of us or our products, or may result in increased scrutiny of our products and any future product candidates from a regulatory perspective, thereby reducing demand for our products, restricting our ability to market our products, or adversely affecting the market price for our common stock.\nThe commercial success of our products depends in part on general public acceptance of the use of human tissue for the treatment of human diseases and other conditions. While not as controversial as the use of embryonic stem cells and fetal tissue, the use of adult tissue has been the subject of substantial debate regarding related ethical, legal and social issues. We do not use embryonic stem cells or fetal tissue, but the public may not be able to, or may fail to, differentiate our autologous use of adult tissue from the use by others of embryonic stem cells or fetal tissue. This could result in a negative perception of our company or our products.\nFuture adverse events in the field of cellular based therapy or changes in public policy could also result in greater governmental regulation of our products and potential regulatory uncertainty or delay relating to any required testing or approval.\nUse of animal-derived materials could harm our product development and commercialization efforts.\nSome of the manufacturing materials and/or components that we use in, and which are critical to, implementation of our technology involve the use of animal-derived products, including fetal bovine serum. Supplier changes or regulatory actions may limit or restrict the availability of such materials for clinical and commercial use for a variety of reasons including contamination or perceived risk of contamination with an adventitious agent, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), in one of our\nsuppliers\u2019 herds. This may lead to a restricted supply of the serum currently required for our product manufacturing processes. Any restrictions on these materials would impose a potential competitive disadvantage for our products or prevent our ability to manufacture our cell products. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have issued regulations for controls over bovine material in animal feed. These regulations do not appear to affect our ability to purchase the manufacturing materials we currently use. However, regulatory agencies may introduce new regulations that could affect our operations. Our inability to develop or obtain alternative compounds would harm our product development and commercialization efforts. There are certain limitations in the supply of certain animal-derived materials, which may lead to delays in our ability to complete clinical trials or eventually to meet the anticipated market demand for our cell products.\nHealth care reform measures and changes in policies, funding, staffing and leadership at the FDA and other agencies could hinder or prevent the commercial success of our products.\nIn the United States, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system in ways that could affect our future results of operations and the future results of operations of our potential customers.\nFurthermore, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (jointly, the Affordable Care Act), which includes measures to significantly change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:\n\u2022\nAn annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic products, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;\n\u2022\nExpansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing both the volume of sales and manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability;\n\u2022\nExpansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;\n\u2022\nNew requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, as defined in the Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations, including reporting any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals and reporting any ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations during the preceding calendar year, with data collection required and reporting to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) required by the 90th day of each calendar year;\n\u2022\n\u2022\nExpansion of health care fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022\nA licensure framework for follow-on biologic products;\n\u2022\nA new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;\n\u2022\nCreation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board which, beginning in 2014, has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program that could result in reduced payments for prescription products and those recommendations could have the effect of law even if Congress does not act on the recommendations; and\n\u2022\nEstablishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government\nto recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations.\nAdditionally, individual states have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally-mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payers or other restrictions could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIn addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what products and which suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs. This can reduce demand for our products or put pressure on our product pricing, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nAdditionally, given recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of healthcare, Congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on healthcare reform and the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. While we cannot predict the full outcome of any such legislation, it may harm our ability to market our products and generate revenues.\nFurthermore, regulatory authorities\u2019 assessment of the data and results required to demonstrate safety and effectiveness can change over time and can be affected by many factors, such as the emergence of new information, including on other products, changing policies and agency funding, staffing and leadership. We cannot be sure whether future changes to the regulatory environment will be favorable or unfavorable to our business prospects.\nTissue-based products are regulated differently in different countries. These requirements may be costly and result in delay or otherwise preclude the distribution of our products in some foreign countries, any of which would adversely affect our ability to generate operating revenues.\nTissue based products are regulated differently in different countries. Many foreign jurisdictions have a different and may have a more difficult regulatory pathway for human tissue based products, which may prohibit the distribution of these products until the applicable regulatory agencies grant marketing approval, or licensure. The process of obtaining regulatory approval is lengthy, expensive and uncertain, and we may never seek such approvals, or if we do, we may never gain those approvals. Any adverse events in our clinical trials for a future product under development could negatively impact our products.\nCompetitor companies or hospitals may be able to take advantage of the EU rules permitting sales of unlicensed medicines for individual patients to sell competing products without a marketing authorization.\nThe EU medicines rules allow individual member states to permit the supply of a medicinal product without a marketing authorization to fulfill special needs, where the product is supplied in response to a bona fide unsolicited order, formulated in accordance with the specifications of a healthcare professional and for use by an individual patient under the healthcare professional's direct personal responsibility.\nThis may, in certain countries, also apply to products manufactured in a country outside the EU and imported to treat specific patients or small groups of patients. In addition, Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products do not need a marketing authorization if they are prepared on a non-routine basis and are used within the same EU member state in a hospital under the exclusive professional responsibility of a medical practitioner and in accordance with a medical prescription for a custom-made product for an individual patient (named-patient basis).\nThese exemptions could allow our competitors to make sales in the EU without having obtained a marketing authorization and without undergoing the expense of clinical trials, especially if those competitors have cell processing facilities in the relevant EU member state. Similarly, certain hospitals may be able to compete with us on the basis of these rules. Because any such sales would be made without a marketing authorization, there would be no need for the competitor company or hospital to refer to the clinical data in our marketing authorization dossiers, and so any data exclusivity protection that we may obtain for our products would not prevent such competing sales.\nThe current credit and financial market conditions may exacerbate certain risks affecting our business.\nWe rely upon third parties for certain aspects of our business, including collaboration partners, wholesale distributors, contract clinical trial providers, contract manufacturers and third-party suppliers. Because of the recent tightening of global credit and the\nvolatility in the financial markets, there may be a delay or disruption in the performance or satisfaction of commitments to us by these third parties, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are dependent on our key manufacturing, quality and other management personnel and the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business.\nOur success depends in large part upon the efforts of our key management and manufacturing and quality staff. The loss of any of these individuals, or our inability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific and management personnel in a timely manner, could materially and adversely affect our business and our future prospects. In the future, we may need to seek additional manufacturing and quality staff members. There is a high demand for highly trained manufacturing and quality personnel in our industry. We face competition for such personnel from other companies, research and academic institutions and other entities. We do not know whether we will be able to attract, train and retain highly qualified manufacturing and quality personnel in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A loss of one or more of our key personnel could severely and negatively impact our operations. Our key personnel are employed \u201cat-will,\u201d and any of them may elect to pursue other opportunities at any time. We have no present intention of obtaining key man life insurance on any of our key management, manufacturing, quality or other personnel.\nA cyber security incident could result in a loss of confidential data, give rise to remediation and other expenses, expose us to liability under HIPAA, consumer protection laws, or other common law theories, subject us to litigation and federal and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation, and otherwise be disruptive to our business.\nWe collect and store sensitive information, including intellectual property and personally identifiable information, on our networks. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations. We have implemented multiple layers of security measures to protect this confidential data through technology, processes, and our people; we utilize current security technologies; and our defenses are monitored and routinely reviewed by internal and external parties. Despite these efforts, threats from malicious persons and groups, new vulnerabilities, and advanced new attacks against information systems create risk of cyber security incidents. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to cyber security incidents that bypass our security measures, result in loss of personal health information or other data subject to privacy laws or disrupt our information systems or business. As a result, cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our information systems from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any cyber security vulnerabilities. The occurrence of any of these events could result in interruptions, delays, the loss, access, misappropriation, disclosure or corruption of data, liability under privacy, security and consumer protection laws or litigation under these or other laws, including common law theories, and subject us to federal and state governmental inquiries, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and harm our business reputation.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe have no patent protection for Epicel.\nWe have no issued patents or pending patent applications relating to Epicel. While we attempt to protect our proprietary information as trade secrets through certain agreements with our employees, consultants, agents and other organizations to which we disclose our proprietary information, we cannot give any assurance that these agreements will provide effective protection for our proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. If other cultured epidermal autografts are approved and marketed, we will be unable to prevent them from competing with Epicel in the marketplace. We expect that the presence of one or more competing products would reduce our market share and could negatively impact price levels and third party reimbursement policies for Epicel, any of which would materially affect our business.\nOur issued patents relating to Carticel and MACI will expire soon and may be insufficient to protect our business.\nWe have issued patents in the United States and in certain foreign countries that relate to the combinations of chondrocytes and collagen membranes used in Carticel and MACI. However, the issued patents relating to Carticel are scheduled to expire by August of 2016 in the U.S. and by 2022 in Europe. Furthermore, the issued patents relating to MACI are scheduled to expire by August of 2016 in the U.S. and by August of 2017 in Europe. When these patents expire we may be subject to increased competition and our opportunity to establish or maintain product revenue could be substantially reduced or eliminated.\nThe patents we own may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with significant commercial protection or commercial advantage, and competitors may be able to design around our patents or develop products that provide outcomes that are similar\nto ours without infringing on our intellectual property rights. In addition, we cannot be certain that any of our pending patent applications will be issued or that the scope of the claims in our pending patent applications will not be significantly narrowed or determined to be invalid.\nIf our patents and proprietary rights do not provide substantial protection, then our business and competitive position will suffer.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to develop or license intellectual property rights to protect our proprietary products and technologies. This involves complex legal, scientific, and factual questions and uncertainties. We rely upon patent, trade secret, copyright and contract laws to protect proprietary technology and trademark law to protect brand identities. However, we cannot assure you that any patent applications filed by, assigned to, or licensed to us will be granted, and that the scope of any of our issued or licensed patents will be sufficiently broad to offer meaningful protection. In addition, our issued patents or patents licensed to us could be successfully challenged, invalidated, held to be unenforceable, or circumvented so that our patent rights would not create an effective competitive barrier. We also cannot assure you that the inventors of the patents and applications that we own or license were the first to invent or the first to file on the inventions, or that a third party will not claim ownership in one of our patents or patent applications. We cannot assure you that a third party does not have or will not obtain patents that dominate the patents we own or license now or in the future.\nPatent law relating to the scope of claims in the biotechnology field is evolving and our patent rights in this country and abroad are subject to this uncertainty. For example, from time to time, the U.S. Supreme Court (Supreme Court), other federal courts, the U.S. Congress or the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) may change the standards of patentability and any such changes could have a negative impact on our business. There have been several cases involving \u201cgene patents\u201d and diagnostic claims that have been considered by the Supreme Court. A suit brought by multiple plaintiffs, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) against Myriad Genetics (Myriad) and the USPTO, could impact biotechnology and diagnostic patents. That case involves certain of Myriad\u2019s U.S. patents related to the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. The Federal Circuit court issued a written decision on July 29, 2011 that reversed the decision of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York that Myriad\u2019s composition claims to \u201cisolated\u201d DNA molecules cover unpatentable subject matter. The Federal Circuit court instead held that the breast cancer genes are patentable subject matter. Subsequently, on March 20, 2012, the Supreme Court issued a decision in Mayo Collaborative v. Prometheus Laboratories (Prometheus) a case involving patent claims directed to optimizing the amount of drug administered to a specific patient. According to that decision, Prometheus\u2019 claims failed to add enough inventive content to the underlying correlations to allow the processes they describe to qualify as patent-eligible processes that apply natural laws. The Supreme Court subsequently granted certiorari in the Myriad case, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case back to the Federal Circuit court for further consideration in light of their decision in the Prometheus case. The Federal Circuit court heard oral arguments on July 20, 2012, and issued a decision on August 16, 2012. The Federal Circuit court reaffirmed its earlier decision and held that composition of matter claims directed to isolated nucleic acids are patent-eligible subject matter, but that method claims consisting of only abstract mental processes are not patent-eligible. On September 25, 2012, the ACLU filed a petition for a writ of certiorari asking the Supreme Court to review the Federal Circuit court\u2019s decision with respect to the composition of matter claims. On November 30, 2012, the Supreme Court granted the petition and agreed to review the case. On June 13, 2013, the Supreme Court issued a decision in the Myriad case. According to the decision, claims directed to genomic DNA cover unpatentable subject matter. However, claims directed to cDNA are patent eligible subject matter.\nOn March 4, 2014, the USPTO issued a memorandum entitled \u201c2014 Procedure For Subject Matter Eligibility Analysis Of Claims Reciting Or Involving Laws Of Nature/Natural Principles, Natural Phenomena, And/Or Natural Products\u201d. This memorandum provides guidance to patent examiners for examining claims reciting laws of nature/natural principles, natural phenomena, and/or natural products for patent eligibility in view of the Supreme Court decisions in Prometheus and Myriad. The guidance indicates that claims reciting such natural subject matter, read as a whole, that do not significantly differ from such natural subject matter should be rejected as non-statutory subject matter. We cannot assure you that our patent portfolio or our efforts to seek patent protection for our technology and products will not be negatively impacted by the guidance issued by the USPTO, the decisions described above, rulings in other cases, or changes in guidance or procedures issued by the USPTO.\nCongress directed the USPTO to study effective ways to provide independent, confirming genetic diagnostic test activity where gene patents and exclusive licensing for primary genetic diagnostic tests exist. This study will examine the impact that independent second opinion testing has on providing medical care to patients; the effect that providing independent second opinion genetic diagnostic testing would have on the existing patent and license holders of an exclusive genetic test; the impact of current practices on testing results and performance; and the role of insurance coverage on the provision of genetic diagnostic tests. The USPTO was directed to report the findings of the study to Congress and provide recommendations for establishing the availability of independent confirming genetic diagnostic test activity by June 16, 2012. On August 28, 2012, the Department of Commerce sent a letter to the House and Senate Judiciary Committee leadership updating them on the status of the genetic testing report. The letter stated in part: \u201cGiven the complexity and diversity of the opinions, comments, and suggestions provided by interested parties,\nand the important policy considerations involved, we believe that further review, discussion, and analysis are required before a final report can be submitted to Congress.\u201d The USPTO issued a Request for Comments and Notice of Public Hearing on Genetic Diagnostic Testing on January 25, 2012, and held additional public hearings in February and March 2013. It is unclear whether the results of this study will be acted upon by the USPTO or result in Congressional efforts to change the law or process in a manner that could negatively impact our present or future patent portfolio.\nThere can be no assurance that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in either the Myriad or Prometheus case will not have a negative impact on biotechnology patents generally or the ability of biotechnology companies to obtain or enforce their patents in the future. Such negative decisions by the Supreme Court could have a material adverse effect on our existing patent portfolio and our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property in the future.\nWe also rely on trade secrets and un-patentable know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, suppliers and licensees. These agreements may be breached, and we might not have adequate remedies for any breach. Our competitors may also independently develop technologies substantially equivalent or superior to ours. If this were to occur, our business and competitive position would suffer.\nGiven our patent position in regard to our products, if we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how related to these products, our competitive position would be impaired and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nSome of our technology, including our knowledge regarding the processing of our products, is unpatented and is maintained by us as trade secrets. In an effort to protect these trade secrets, we require our employees, consultants, collaborators and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us. These agreements require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual\u2019s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. These agreements, however, may not provide us with adequate protection against improper use or disclosure of confidential information, and these agreements may be breached. A breach of confidentiality could affect our competitive position. In addition, in some situations, these agreements may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees, consultants, collaborators or advisors have previous employment or consulting relationships. Also, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.\nAdequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information. The disclosure of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submissions, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our products or product candidates, our competitive position would be adversely affected.\nWith respect to MACI and ixmyelocel-T, if we are unable to obtain and enforce patents and to protect our trade secrets, others could use our technology to compete with us, which could limit opportunities for us to generate revenues by licensing our technology and selling products.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and maintain trade secrets in the United States and in other countries. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining and enforcing patents, our competitors could use our technology and create products that compete with our products, without paying license fees or royalties to us.\nThe preparation, filing, and prosecution of patent applications can be costly and time consuming. Our limited financial resources may not permit us to pursue patent protection of all of our technology and products throughout the world.\nEven if we are able to obtain issued patents covering our technology or products, we may have to incur substantial legal fees and other expenses to enforce our patent rights in order to protect our technology and products from infringing uses. We may not have the financial resources to finance the litigation required to preserve our patent and trade secret rights.\nA successful challenge to our trademarks could force us to rebrand Epicel, Carticel, or MACI.\nWe rely on our trademarks to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors, and have registered or applied to register a number of these trademarks. Third parties may challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing these new brands.\nIntellectual property litigation could harm our business. We may be subject to patent infringement claims that could be costly to defend, which may limit our ability to use disputed technologies, and which could prevent us from pursuing research and development or commercialization of some of our products, require us to pay licensing fees to have freedom to operate and/or result in monetary damages or other liability for us.\nThe success of our business will depend significantly on our ability to operate without infringing patents and other proprietary rights of others. Our cell processing system and cell compositions utilize a wide variety of technologies and we can give no assurance that we have identified or can identify all inventions and patents that may be infringed by development and manufacture of our cell compositions. If the technology that we use infringes a patent held by others, we could be sued for monetary damages by the patent holder or its licensee, or we could be prevented from continuing research, development, and commercialization of products that rely on that technology, unless we are able to obtain a license to use the patent. The cost and availability of a license to a patent cannot be predicted, and the likelihood of obtaining a license at an acceptable cost would be lower if the patent holder or any of its licensees is using the patent to develop or market a product with which any of our existing product candidates or our products would compete. If we could not obtain a necessary license, we would need to develop or obtain rights to alternative technologies, which could prove costly and could cause delays in product development, or we could be forced to discontinue the development or marketing of any products that were developed using the technology covered by the patent.\nAlthough we have not been subject to any filed infringement claims, patents could exist or could be filed which would prohibit or limit our ability to market our products or maintain our competitive position. In the event of an intellectual property dispute, we may be forced to litigate. Such litigation is typically protracted and the results are unpredictable. Intellectual property litigation would divert management\u2019s attention from developing our products and would force us to incur substantial costs regardless of whether we are successful. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties including treble damages and the opposing party\u2019s attorney fees, and force us to pay significant license fees and royalties or cease the development and sale of our products and processes.\nWe have hired and expect to continue to hire individuals who have experience in cell culture and cell based therapeutics and may have confidential trade secret or proprietary information of third parties. We caution these individuals not to use or reveal this third-party information, but we cannot assure you that these individuals will not use or reveal this third-party information. Thus, we could be sued for misappropriation of proprietary information and trade secrets. Such claims are expensive to defend and could divert our attention and could result in substantial damage awards and injunctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful and have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of our own intellectual property rights or the proprietary rights of others. Also, third parties may initiate legal proceedings against us to challenge the validity or scope of intellectual property rights we own or control. These proceedings can be expensive and time consuming. Many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to defend their intellectual property rights than we can. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.\nLitigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, which could harm our business and financial results. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent owned by or licensed to us is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not\ncover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we infringe the rights of third parties we could be prevented from selling products, forced to pay damages, and defend against litigation.\nIf our products, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and we may have to: obtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all; abandon an infringing product; redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement; stop using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others; pay damages; and/or defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u2022\nOthers may be able to make products that are the same as or similar to our products or product candidates, but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u2022\nWe or any strategic partners might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patents or pending patent applications that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u2022\nWe might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u2022\nOthers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nIt is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n\u2022\nIssued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges;\n\u2022\nOur competitors might conduct research and development activities in the U.S. and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for certain research and development activities, as well as in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u2022\nWe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and\n\u2022\nThe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nOthers may challenge our patent or other intellectual property rights or sue us for infringement.\nThe use of our products and product candidates may expose us to product liability claims, and we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance. As a result, such claims could affect our earnings and financial condition.\nWe face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the manufacture and/or use of our products during clinical trials, or after commercialization, results in adverse events. Moreover, we derive the raw materials for our products from patients serving as their own donors, the production process is complex, and the handling requirements are specific, all of which increase the likelihood of quality failures and subsequent product liability claims. We may not be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or at all. If we are unable to obtain insurance, or if claims against us substantially exceed our coverage, then our business could be adversely impacted. Excessive insurance costs or uninsured claims would increase our operating loss and adversely affect our financial condition. Whether or not we are ultimately successful in any product liability litigation, such litigation could consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources and could result in, among other things:\n\u2022\nSignificant awards against us;\n\u2022\nSubstantial litigation costs;\n\u2022\nRecall of the product;\n\u2022\nInjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\nWithdrawal of clinical trial participants; or\n\u2022\nAdverse regulatory action.\nAny of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to an Investment in our Common Stock\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over segregation of duties. If we fail to remediate this material weakness and implement and maintain proper and effective internal control over segregation of duties in the future, a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, which could harm our operating results, investors\u2019 views of us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe identified a material weakness in the operation of our internal controls over segregation of duties as of December 31, 2015. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness relates to the design of controls to mitigate segregation of duties conflicts in our financial management/ERP software. Specifically, our Controller had access to modules in the financial management software beyond necessary to perform the job of Controller, and the controls that were designed and implemented to be performed by the Controller to mitigate the incompatible duties of other financial personnel were ineffective. Thus, the material weakness impacted substantially all financial statement accounts and all financial statement assertions. While the material weakness did not result in any financial statement adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2015, it could result in misstatements to substantially all accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. We have commenced efforts to remediate this material weakness through modification and removal of the controller's access to modules in the financial management software. However, if we cannot correct the material weakness we have identified, or if we experience other material weaknesses investor confidence and our stock price could be adversely affected. Further, if other material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal controls exist and go undetected, our financial statements could contain material misstatements that, when discovered in the future, could cause us to fail to meet our future reporting obligations and cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nThe market price of the common stock of the combined company may be affected by factors different from those affecting the market price for our common stock in recent history.\nOur business in recent history differs from that of the CTRM business, and our current combined business differs from recent history, and accordingly, the results of operations for the combined company may be affected by factors different from those affecting our results of operation in recent history. As a result, the market price for our stock may be impacted differently in the future by those factors than it is currently.\nOur common stock price has been volatile and future sales of shares of common stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of such shares.\nThe market price of shares of our common stock has been volatile, ranging in closing price between $1.71 and $3.95 during the year ended December 31, 2015. The price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as:\n\u2022\nClinical trial results;\n\u2022\nThe amount of our cash resources and our ability to obtain additional funding;\n\u2022\nAnnouncements of research activities, business developments, technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nEntering into or terminating strategic relationships;\n\u2022\nRegulatory developments in both the United States and abroad;\n\u2022\nDisputes concerning patents or proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nChanges in our revenues or expense levels;\n\u2022\nSeasonal or other variations in patient demand for Carticel and Epicel;\n\u2022\nPublic concern regarding the safety, efficacy or other aspects of the products or methodologies we are developing;\n\u2022\nNews or reports from other stem cell, cell therapy or regenerative medicine companies;\n\u2022\nReports by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nStatus of the investment markets;\n\u2022\nConcerns related to management transitions; and\n\u2022\nDelisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market.\nAny of these events may cause the price of our shares to fall, which may adversely affect our business and financing opportunities. In addition, the stock market in general and the market prices for biotechnology companies in particular have experienced significant volatility recently that often has been unrelated to the operating performance or financial conditions of such companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance or prospects.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market could result in a de-listing of our common stock.\nIf we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, NASDAQ may take steps to de-list our common stock. Such a de-listing would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a de-listing, we would take actions to restore our compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the NASDAQ minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s listing requirements.\nThe sale of our common stock through future equity offerings may cause dilution and could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nIn the year-ended December 31, 2014, we sold (i) an aggregate gross amount of approximately $7.1 million worth of shares of common stock pursuant to our At-the-Market Sales Agreement (ATM) with MLV (ii) an aggregate of approximately $3.7 million worth of shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park pursuant to the Lincoln Park Equity Line, and (iii) on September 17, 2014, we sold 15.8 million shares of common stock under a Form S-1 registration statement and pursuant to a prospectus first made available on September 11, 2014. The ATM, which as of December 31, 2015 had remaining capacity of approximately $7.8 million, allowed us to sell our common stock from time to time under a registration statement on Form S-3 filed in June 2011, pursuant to which we registered $100 million of our securities for public sale. The Form S-3 registration statement filed in June 2011 expired in July 2014. Additionally, pursuant to the Lincoln Park Equity Line we may direct Lincoln Park to purchase up to $15 million worth of shares of our common stock over a 30-month period generally in amounts up to 50 thousand shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2015, we had remaining capacity of approximately $11.3 million worth of shares under the Lincoln Park Equity Line. However, there are certain factors, such as volume of trading in our common stock, our stock price and the ability to terminate the agreement with notice, which limit the amount that can be raised in a short period of time through the Lincoln Park Equity Line.\nSales of our common stock offered through future equity offerings may result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock to investors, or anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock, and accordingly, shareholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on various factors, including our operating results, financial condition, future prospects and any other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. You should not rely on an investment in our company if you require dividend income from your investment in our company. The success of your investment will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation of the market price of our common stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value.\nOur Loan and Security Agreement contains restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business. We may be required to make a prepayment or repay the outstanding indebtedness earlier than we expect if a prepayment event or an event of default occurs, including a material adverse change with respect to us, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nThe Loan and Security Agreement contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nconvey, sell, lease or otherwise dispose of certain parts of our business or property;\n\u2022\nchange the nature of our business;\n\u2022\nliquidate or dissolve;\n\u2022\nenter into certain change in control or acquisition transactions;\n\u2022\nincur or assume certain debt;\n\u2022\ngrant certain types of liens on our assets;\n\u2022\nmaintain certain collateral accounts;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make certain distributions to our stockholders;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nenter into material transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nmake or permit certain payments on subordinate debt; and\n\u2022\nbecome an \u201cinvestment company\u201d as defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.\nThe restrictive covenants of the Loan and Security Agreement could cause us to be unable to pursue business opportunities that we or our stockholders may consider beneficial.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the Loan and Security Agreement. An event of default will also occur if, among other things, a material adverse change in our business, operations or condition occurs, which could potentially include negative results in clinical trials, or a material impairment of the prospect of our repayment of any portion of the amounts we owe under the Loan and Security Agreement occurs. In the case of a continuing event of default under the agreement, SVB could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable, proceed against the collateral in which we granted SVB a security interest under the Loan and Security Agreement, or otherwise exercise the rights of a secured creditor. Amounts outstanding under the Loan and Security Agreement are secured by all of our existing and future assets, excluding intellectual property, which is subject to a negative pledge arrangement.\nWe expect that our quarterly results of operations will fluctuate, and this fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline. The nature of our business involves variable factors, such as the timing of the research, development and regulatory pathways of our product candidates, which could cause our operating results to fluctuate. Due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenues and expenses, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance.\nEfforts to comply with securities laws and regulations will increase our costs and require additional management resources, and we still may fail to comply.\nAs directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on their internal controls over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10-K. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we are no longer a smaller reporting company and therefore, the independent registered public accounting firm auditing our financial statements is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. If, in any year, we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting or if our independent registered public accounting firm is required to, but is unable to provide us with a report as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could result in a decrease in the value of our securities.\nIf our common stock becomes subject to the SEC\u2019s penny stock rules, broker-dealers may experience difficulty in completing customer transactions and trading activity in our securities may be adversely affected.\nIf at any time our securities are no longer listed on a national securities exchange, including The NASDAQ Stock Market, or we have net tangible assets of $5.0 million or less and our common stock has a market price per share of less than $5.00, transactions in our common stock will be subject to the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. If our common stock becomes subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, broker-dealers may find it difficult to effectuate customer transactions and trading activity in our securities may be adversely affected. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require:\n\u2022\nThat a broker or dealer approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks; and\n\u2022\nThe broker or dealer receives from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.\nIn order to approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must:\n\u2022\nObtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person; and\n\u2022\nMake a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.\nThe broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form:\n\u2022\nSets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and\n\u2022\nThat the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction.\nGenerally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock.\nDisclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nOur corporate documents and Michigan law contain provisions that may make it more difficult for us to be acquired.\nOur Board of Directors (Board) has the authority, without shareholder approval, to issue additional shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of these shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders. Michigan law contains a provision that makes it more difficult for a 10% shareholder, or its officers, to acquire a company. This authority, together with certain provisions of our charter documents, may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third-party from attempting to acquire, control of our company. This effect could occur even if our shareholders consider the change in control to be in their best interest. We have adopted a shareholder rights plan, the purpose of which is, among other things, to enhance our Board\u2019s ability to protect shareholder interests and to ensure that shareholders receive fair treatment in the event any coercive takeover attempt of our company is made in the future. The shareholder rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from acquiring, our company or a large block of our company\u2019s common stock.", "PERMNO": 84511, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "VCEL"}
