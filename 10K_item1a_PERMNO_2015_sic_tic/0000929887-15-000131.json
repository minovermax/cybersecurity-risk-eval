Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In order to help assess the major risks in our business, we have identified many, but not all, of these risks, categorized as Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Industry in Which We Operate, Risks Related to our Business and Risks Related to the Control Over our Voting Stock. Due to the scope of our operations, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance.\nIf any of the following risks are realized, our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, and as a result, the trading price of our Class A common stock could be materially and adversely impacted. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with other information set forth in this Annual Report, including Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, including the related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 23\nRisks Related to the Highly Regulated Industry in Which We Operate\nIf we fail to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements for our business, we could face significant monetary liabilities, fines and penalties, including loss of access to U.S. federal student loans and grants for our students.\nWe are subject to extensive U.S. federal and state regulation as a provider of postsecondary education. The principal federal regulatory regime is established under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as it is amended and reauthorized from time to time, and the regulations promulgated under the Act by the U.S. Department of Education. Among other matters, these regulations govern the participation by University of Phoenix in federal student financial aid programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act (\u201cTitle IV\u201d), which is the principal source of funding for students at the University. A significant majority of our fiscal year 2015 total consolidated net revenue was derived from receipt of Title IV program funds disbursed to our students.\nThe Higher Education Act, as reauthorized, mandates specific regulatory responsibilities for each of the following components of the higher education regulatory triad: (1) the federal government through the U.S. Department of Education; (2) independent accrediting agencies recognized by the Department of Education; and (3) state higher education regulatory bodies.\nThe applicable regulatory requirements cover virtually all phases of our U.S. operations, including educational program offerings, branching and classroom locations, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing and recruiting, financial operations, payment of refunds to students who withdraw, maintenance of restricted cash, acquisitions or openings of new schools, commencement of new or cessation of existing educational programs and changes in our corporate structure and ownership.\nThe applicable regulations, standards and policies of the various regulatory agencies frequently change and often are subject to interpretative uncertainty, particularly where they are crafted for traditional, academic term-based schools rather than our non-term academic delivery model. Changes in, or new interpretations of, applicable laws, regulations, standards or policies could have a material adverse effect on our accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, permissible activities, receipt of funds under Title IV programs, costs of doing business and our ability to implement beneficial changes in our academic or business model. We cannot predict how the requirements administered by these agencies will be applied or interpreted in the future, or whether our schools will be able to comply with any future changes in these requirements.\nIf we are found to have violated any applicable regulations, standards or policies, we may be subject to the following sanctions imposed by any one or more of the relevant regulatory agencies:\n\u2022\nMonetary fines or penalties;\n\u2022\nLimitation or termination of our operations or ability to grant degrees, diplomas and certificates;\n\u2022\nRestriction or revocation of our accreditation, licensure or other operating authority;\n\u2022\nLimitation, suspension or termination of our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, military benefit programs or state financial aid programs;\n\u2022\nImposition by the U.S. Department of Education of a delay in the disbursement of Title IV program funds or transfer from the Department\u2019s advance system of receiving Title IV program funds to its reimbursement system, under which a school must disburse its own funds to students and document the students\u2019 eligibility for Title IV program funds before receiving such funds from the Department;\n\u2022\nRepayment of funds received under Title IV programs or state financial aid programs;\n\u2022\nRequirement to post a letter of credit with the U.S. Department of Education;\n\u2022\nRequirement of heightened cash monitoring by the U.S. Department of Education;\n\u2022\nOther civil or criminal penalties; and/or\n\u2022\nOther forms of censure.\nIn addition, in some circumstances of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance, we may be subject to qui tam lawsuits under the Federal False Claims Act or various, similar state false claim statutes. In these actions, private plaintiffs seek to enforce remedies under the Act on behalf of the federal government and, if successful, are entitled to recover their costs and to receive a portion of any amounts recovered by the federal government in the lawsuit. These lawsuits can be prosecuted by a private plaintiff, even if the Department does not agree with plaintiff\u2019s theory of liability. In 2009, we settled a qui tam lawsuit relating to alleged payment of incentive compensation to our enrollment counselors for a total payment of $80.5 million, and we currently are subject to a qui tam lawsuit alleging payment of improper incentive compensation in subsequent periods. For more information about the pending qui tam case, refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe proprietary higher education industry is experiencing broad-based, intensifying scrutiny in the form of coordinated investigations and enforcement actions. In October 2014, the Department of Education formed an inter-agency task force involving multiple federal agencies and departments including the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Departments of Justice,\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 24\nTreasury and Veterans Affairs, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and numerous state attorneys general, to coordinate activities and share information to protect students from unfair, deceptive and abusive policies and practices. We believe that the recent investigations of University of Phoenix commenced by the Federal Trade Commission and the California Attorney General are related to this coordinated scrutiny of the industry and that this coordinated scrutiny could lead to the initiation of additional inquiries or claims against us either by participants in the inter-agency task force or other regulatory authorities, any of which could adversely affect our business and reputation. In addition, in October 2015, University of Phoenix was placed on probationary status in respect of its participation in the U.S. Department of Defense Tuition Assistance Program for active duty military personnel, in part due to the pendency of the Federal Trade Commission and California Attorney General investigations. Refer to Part 1, Item 1 - Business - Financial Aid Programs above for more information about this action. We expect that this challenging regulatory environment will continue for the foreseeable future, and may intensify.\nAny of the penalties, funding delays, injunctions, restrictions, lawsuits or other forms of censure described above, and the associated reputational impact from ongoing investigations, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Recently, the Department of Education imposed a 21-day Title IV funding delay on a major proprietary institution due to a dispute about the pace at which the institution was producing information sought by the Department, which delay contributed to the institution closing and ultimately seeking bankruptcy protection. If we lose our Title IV program eligibility, or our participation is materially conditioned or subject to material delays, we would experience a dramatic decline in revenue and we would be unable to continue our business as it currently is conducted.\nIf we fail to maintain our institutional accreditation, we could lose our ability to participate in Title IV programs, which would materially and adversely affect our business.\nIn July 2013, the accreditation of University of Phoenix was reaffirmed by HLC through the 2022-2023 academic year. At the same time, HLC placed the University on Notice status for a two-year period due to concerns regarding governance, student assessment and faculty scholarship/research for doctoral programs. Notice status is a sanction that means that HLC has determined that an institution is on a course of action that, if continued, could lead the institution to be out of compliance with one or more of the HLC Criteria for Accreditation or Core Components.\nThe University submitted a Notice Report to HLC in November 2014 providing evidence that the University has ameliorated the conditions that led to the Notice status and continues to meet relevant accreditation requirements. The HLC Board of Trustees subsequently removed the University from Notice status, effective June 25, 2015.\nWe believe that the imposition of the sanction of notice adversely impacted the reputation of University of Phoenix and may have contributed to the University\u2019s continuing decline in enrollment. In addition, the changes made by University of Phoenix to its corporate governance and administrative structure to address the concerns of HLC regarding independence have increased our operating costs and decreased our managerial flexibility to address the rapidly evolving and challenging postsecondary education market.\nThe University remains assigned by HLC to the Standard Pathway reaffirmation process, pursuant to which the University will host a comprehensive evaluation visit in 2016-2017 and will undergo its next reaffirmation process in 2022-2023.\nContinued institutional accreditation is critical to University of Phoenix\u2019s business. If the University should lose its institutional accreditation, our business would be substantially impaired and we would not be able to continue our business as it is presently conducted.\nThe U.S. Department of Education gainful employment regulations may limit the programs we can offer students and increase our cost of operations.\nUnder the Higher Education Act, as reauthorized, proprietary schools are generally eligible to participate in Title IV programs only in respect of educational programs that lead to \u201cgainful employment in a recognized occupation.\u201d In connection with this requirement, proprietary postsecondary institutions are required to provide information to prospective students about each eligible program, including the relevant recognized occupations, cost, completion rate, job placement rate, and median loan debt of program completers. These reporting requirements increase our costs of operations and could adversely impact student enrollment, persistence and retention if our reported program information compares unfavorably with other reporting educational institutions.\nIn October 2014, the U.S. Department of Education published final regulations, effective July 1, 2015, on the metrics for determining whether an academic program prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. Under the final regulations, which apply on a program-by-program basis, students enrolled in a program will be eligible for Title IV student financial aid only if that program satisfies at least one of two tests relating to student debt service-to-earnings ratios. The two tests specify minimum debt service-to-earnings ratios calculated on the basis of the earnings of program graduates; one test measures student loan debt service as a percentage of total earnings, and the other test measures student loan debt service as a percentage of discretionary earnings. If a program fails to meet at least one of the minimum ratios for one year, the\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 25\ninstitution will be required to provide a warning notice to prospective and enrolled students advising that the program may lose Title IV eligibility based on the final student debt service-to-earnings ratios for the next award year. Programs that fail to meet at least one of the minimum ratios for two years will immediately cease to be Title IV eligible for a period not less than three years.\nUnder the final regulations, schools are also required to certify to the Department the following for each Title IV eligible program:\n\u2022\nThe program is included in the schools\u2019 accreditation;\n\u2022\nThe program is programmatically accredited, if required by a federal government entity, or by a government entity in any state in which the school is located or is required to obtain state approval;\n\u2022\nThe program satisfies any applicable state licensing and certification requirements for the occupations for which the program prepares students to enter; and\n\u2022\nThe program is not substantially similar to a program offered by the school that became ineligible due to the student debt service-to-earnings ratios.\nThe Department has indicated that the official 2014 gainful employment debt service-to-earnings ratios will be issued sometime during calendar year 2016. The expected timing of the issuance of the 2015 ratios has not yet been announced. We believe it is likely that some of University of Phoenix\u2019s programs will be impacted by the regulations. However, the University ceased enrolling new students in most of the programs it believes may be impacted in connection with its initiatives to transform itself into a more focused, higher retaining and less complex institution. Students currently enrolled in these programs represent approximately 10% of the University\u2019s Degreed Enrollment and these programs will continue for such students, who will be taught-out in due course.\nThe Department has not yet announced the protocol for calculating and disseminating the debt service-to-earnings ratios. Because the ratios will be issued by the Department after the measuring period, we may not know of a program\u2019s failure to meet the tests until after the measuring period, and students enrolled in such a program could lose their access to federal financial aid before completing the program.\nUnder the gainful employment regulations, the continuing eligibility of our educational programs for Title IV program funding would be at risk due to factors beyond our control, such as changes in the actual or deemed income level of our graduates, changes in student borrowing levels, increases in interest rates, changes in the federal poverty income level relevant for calculating discretionary income, changes in the percentage of our former students who are current in repayment of their student loans, and other factors. The exposure to these external factors could reduce our ability to confidently offer or continue certain types of programs for which there is market demand, and therefore would impact our ability to maintain or grow our business.\nIn addition, if we are required to include a warning notice for any of our programs based on the debt service-to-earnings ratios, enrollment in those programs may decline materially, particularly in light of the widely-publicized difficulties experienced by students in recent years who were enrolled in schools that have closed. Accordingly, the inclusion of these required warnings could make continuation of the affected programs impractical, even if students in the programs are still eligible to participate in Title IV aid programs.\nUniversity of Phoenix\u2019s certification to participate in Title IV programs expired in December 2012 and continues on a month-to-month basis. If University of Phoenix is not recertified to participate in Title IV programs by the U.S. Department of Education, University of Phoenix would not be eligible to participate in Title IV programs and we could not conduct our business as it is currently conducted.\nUniversity of Phoenix is certified by the U.S. Department of Education to participate in Title IV programs. The University was recertified in November 2009 and its current certification expired in December 2012. University of Phoenix has submitted necessary documentation for recertification and its eligibility continues on a month-to-month basis until the Department issues its decision on the application. We believe that the University\u2019s application will be renewed in due course. However, we cannot predict whether or to what extent the continued challenging political and regulatory climate and other recent developments relating to our business may have on the timing or outcome of the recertification process.\nGenerally, the recertification process includes a review by the Department of the institution\u2019s educational programs and locations, administrative capability, financial responsibility, and other oversight categories. The Department could limit, suspend or terminate an institution\u2019s participation in Title IV programs, by approving recertification on the basis of a temporary provisional program participation agreement or through other means, for violations of the Higher Education Act, as reauthorized, or Title IV program regulations. If the University\u2019s recertification is approved on a provisional basis, the University could be subject to various operating limitations imposed by the Department and would have limited rights of due process in connection with any future sanctions or termination for noncompliance.\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 26\nContinued Title IV program eligibility is critical to the operation of our business. If University of Phoenix becomes ineligible to participate in Title IV programs, or participation is materially limited, we could not conduct our business as it is currently conducted and it would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nAction by the U.S. Congress to revise the laws governing federal student financial aid programs or reduce funding for these programs, including changes applicable only to proprietary educational institutions, could reduce our enrollment and increase our costs of operation.\nThe U.S. Congress must periodically reauthorize the Higher Education Act and annually determine the funding level for each Title IV program. The current Higher Education Act reauthorization expired September 30, 2013. Congress continues to engage in Higher Education Act reauthorization hearings and Title IV programs remain authorized and functioning. Changes to the Higher Education Act, including changes in eligibility and funding for Title IV programs, are likely to occur in connection with the next reauthorization, but we cannot predict the scope or substance of any such changes.\nThe Pell Grant program is one of the largest non-defense discretionary spending programs in the federal budget. Because of this, it is a target for reduction as Congress addresses the competing demands for funding and the chronic and significant U.S. budget deficits. Furthermore, a recent study by the U.S. Federal Reserve System demonstrated a direct relationship between student financial aid increases, including Pell Grant increases, and tuition levels, which could impact future Pell Grant amounts. A reduction in the maximum annual Pell Grant amount or changes in eligibility could result in increased student borrowing, which would make more difficult our ability to comply with other important regulatory requirements, such as the student loan cohort default rate regulations, which are discussed below, and could negatively impact enrollment.\nIn addition to Congress\u2019s focus on the federal government\u2019s funding challenges, in recent years, there has been substantial and continuing increased focus by members of the U.S. Congress on the role that proprietary educational institutions play in higher education. We expect this focus to continue. Congressional hearings and roundtable discussions have been held regarding various aspects of the education industry, and reports have been issued that are highly critical of proprietary institutions and include a number of recommendations to be considered by Congress in connection with the upcoming reauthorization of the federal Higher Education Act as discussed above. Because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from Title IV programs, any action by Congress that reduces Title IV program funding, or alters the eligibility of our institutions or students to participate in Title IV programs could have a material adverse effect on our enrollment and financial condition. Action by Congress or federal agencies could also require us to modify our practices in ways that increase our administrative costs and reduce our operating income.\nIn addition to possible reductions in Title IV program funding, certain military benefit programs may be reduced as military branches address decreased funding. Reductions and/or changes in military benefit programs could result in increased student borrowing, decreased enrollment and adverse impacts on our 90/10 Rule percentage, as discussed below.\nIf Congress reduced the eligibility or amount of available Title IV program funding, we would attempt to arrange for alternative sources of financial aid for our students, which may include lending funds directly to our students. However, private sources would not be able to provide as much funding to our students or on terms comparable to Title IV programs and such programs are under intense scrutiny from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other regulatory agencies. In addition, private funding sources could require us to guarantee all or part of this assistance and we might incur other additional costs. For these reasons, private, alternative sources of student financial aid would only partly offset, if at all, the impact on our business of reduced Title IV program eligibility or funding, and would not be a practical alternative in the case of a significant reduction in Title IV program eligibility or funding.\nOur schools and programs would lose their eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs if the percentage of revenue derived from those programs is too high, in which event we could not conduct our business as it is currently conducted.\nUniversity of Phoenix, and all other proprietary institutions of higher education, are subject to the so-called \u201c90/10 Rule\u201d under the Higher Education Act, as reauthorized. Under this rule, a proprietary institution will be ineligible to participate in Title IV programs for at least two fiscal years if for any two consecutive fiscal years it derives more than 90% of its cash basis revenue, as defined in the rule, from Title IV programs. If an institution is determined to be ineligible, any disbursements of Title IV program funds made after the end of the second fiscal year in the measuring period must be repaid to the U.S. Department of Education. An institution that derives more than 90% of its cash basis revenue from Title IV programs for any single fiscal year will be automatically placed on provisional certification for two fiscal years and will be subject to possible additional sanctions determined to be appropriate under the circumstances by the Department. While the Department has broad discretion to impose additional sanctions on such an institution, there is only limited precedent available to predict what those sanctions might be, particularly in the current regulatory environment. For example, the Department could impose conditions in the provisional certification such as:\n\u2022\nRestrictions on the total amount of Title IV program funds that may be disbursed to students;\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 27\n\u2022\nRestrictions on programmatic and geographic expansion;\n\u2022\nRequirements to obtain and post letters of credit;\n\u2022\nAdditional reporting requirements such as interim financial reporting; or\n\u2022\nAny other conditions deemed appropriate by the Department.\nThe 90/10 Rule percentages for University of Phoenix were as follows for the indicated periods:\nSee the discussion of the 90/10 Rule in Part I, Item 1, Business - Regulatory Environment, above.\nAny necessary efforts to reduce the 90/10 Rule percentage for University of Phoenix, especially if the percentage exceeds 90% for a fiscal year, may involve taking measures which reduce our revenue, increase our operating expenses, or both, in each case perhaps significantly. In addition, we may be required to make structural changes to our business in the future in order to remain in compliance, which changes may materially alter the manner in which we conduct our business and materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition. Furthermore, these required changes could make it more difficult to comply with other important regulatory requirements, such as the student loan cohort default rate regulations, which are discussed below.\nIn recent years, Congress has increased its focus on military benefit programs used for education at proprietary institutions. These military benefit programs are not part of Title IV, and therefore funding under these programs is not included in the 90% portion of the 90/10 Rule. Various bills have been introduced in Congress that would revise the 90/10 Rule to count Department of Defense tuition assistance and Department of Veterans Affairs Post-9/11 GI Bill veterans educational benefits toward the 90% limit, and to reduce the threshold to 85%. We cannot predict the likelihood that Congress will amend the 90/10 Rule in either manner. If all military benefit program funding was included in the 90% portion of the rule calculation, University of Phoenix\u2019s fiscal year 2015 90/10 Rule percentage would have been higher.\nIn October 2015, University of Phoenix was placed on probationary status in respect of its participation in the U.S. Department of Defense Tuition Assistance Program for active duty military personnel. During this probation, newly enrolled active duty military personnel will not be eligible to participate in this program, the funding under which represented less than 1% of University\u2019s net revenue in fiscal year 2015. For more information, refer to Part I, Item 1 Business - Financial Aid Programs, above.\nA failure to demonstrate \u201cfinancial responsibility\u201d or \u201cadministrative capability\u201d may result in the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and limit our access to liquidity, which would materially and adversely affect our business.\nTo participate in Title IV programs, the U.S. Department of Education regulations specify that an eligible institution must satisfy specific measures of financial responsibility prescribed by the Department, or post a letter of credit in favor of the Department and possibly accept other conditions on its participation in Title IV programs. Pursuant to the Title IV program regulations, each eligible higher education institution must satisfy a measure of financial responsibility that is based on a weighted average of the following three annual ratios which assess the financial condition of the institution:\n\u2022\nPrimary Reserve Ratio - measure of an institution\u2019s financial viability and liquidity;\n\u2022\nEquity Ratio - measure of an institution\u2019s capital resources and its ability to borrow; and\n\u2022\nNet Income Ratio - measure of an institution\u2019s profitability.\nThese ratios provide three individual scores which are converted into a single composite score. The maximum composite score is 3.0. If the institution achieves a composite score of at least 1.5, it is considered financially responsible. A composite score from 1.0 to 1.4 is also considered financially responsible, and the institution may continue to participate as a financially responsible institution for up to three years, subject to additional monitoring and other consequences. If an institution does not achieve a composite score of at least 1.0, it can be transferred from the \u201cadvance\u201d system of payment of Title IV program funds to cash monitoring status or to the \u201creimbursement\u201d system of payment, under which the institution must disburse its own funds to students and document the students\u2019 eligibility for Title IV program funds before receiving such funds from the U.S. Department of Education. If this were to occur, we would be unable to conduct our business as it is currently conducted.\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 28\nThe composite scores for Apollo Education Group and University of Phoenix were as follows for the indicated periods:\nIn addition, our principal revolving credit facility requires that we maintain composite scores of at least 1.5. If our composite scores fall below 1.5, it would be an event of default under the facility and the outstanding balance could be declared immediately due and payable. If in connection with composite scores below 1.5 the Department of Education required that we post a letter of credit, our revolving credit facility would not be available for that purpose and there is no assurance that other sources would be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Furthermore, if our revolving credit facility is no longer available, our composite scores could be reduced even further.\nIf our composite scores approach 1.5 in the future, which could result from our use of available capital to fund acquisitions, further declines in our cash flows or profitability or other factors, we may be limited in our ability to deploy capital to effect one or more desirable transactions or initiatives due to the impact on our composite scores. We may also be unable to satisfy our working capital and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations due in part to the potential impact on our revolving credit facility discussed above. To address a declining composite score, we may be required to seek additional capital through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities, which would be dilutive to our existing shareholders, but there is no assurance that such equity or equity-linked capital would be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nFurthermore, the Department regulations specify extensive criteria an institution must satisfy to establish that it has the requisite administrative capability to participate in Title IV programs. The failure of an institution to satisfy any of the criteria used to assess administrative capability may cause the Department to determine that the institution lacks administrative capability and, therefore, subject the institution to additional scrutiny or deny eligibility for Title IV programs. These criteria require, among other things, that the institution:\n\u2022\nComply with all applicable Title IV program regulations;\n\u2022\nHave capable and sufficient personnel to administer the Title IV programs;\n\u2022\nHave acceptable methods of defining and measuring the satisfactory academic progress of its students;\n\u2022\nNot have student loan cohort default rates above specified levels;\n\u2022\nHave procedures in place for safeguarding federal funds;\n\u2022\nNot be, and not have any principal or affiliate who is, debarred or suspended from federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension;\n\u2022\nProvide financial aid counseling to its students;\n\u2022\nRefer to the Office of Inspector General any credible information indicating that any applicant, student, employee or agent of the institution has been engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV programs;\n\u2022\nSubmit in a timely manner all reports and financial statements required by the regulations; and\n\u2022\nNot otherwise appear to lack administrative capability.\nIf we, or our schools eligible to participate in Title IV programs fail to maintain administrative capability or financial responsibility, as defined by the Department, our schools could lose their eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or have that eligibility adversely conditioned, which could significantly reduce the enrollments and revenues of our schools eligible to participate in Title IV programs and materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nAn increase in student loan default rates could result in the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which would materially and adversely affect our business.\nTo remain eligible to participate in Title IV programs, an educational institution\u2019s student loan cohort default rates must remain below certain specified levels. Each cohort is the group of students who first enter into student loan repayment during a federal fiscal year (ending September 30) for a three-year measuring period.\nAn educational institution loses eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if its cohort default rate equals or exceeds 40% for any given year or 30% for three consecutive years. If an institution\u2019s cohort default rate equals or exceeds 30% for any given year, it must establish a default prevention task force and develop a default prevention plan with measurable objectives for improving the cohort default rate.\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 29\nBased on information published by the U.S. Department of Education, the cohort default rates for University of Phoenix and for all proprietary postsecondary institutions for the applicable federal fiscal years were as follows:\nSee the discussion of cohort default rates in Part I, Item 1, Business - Regulatory Environment, above.\nIf our student loan default rates approach the applicable limits in the future, we may be required to increase efforts and resources dedicated to improving these default rates. This is challenging because most borrowers who are in default or at risk of default are no longer students, and we may have only limited contact with them. Furthermore, continued increased attention has been given by members of Congress and others on default aversion activities of proprietary education institutions. If such attention leads to congressional or regulatory action restricting the types of default aversion assistance that educational institutions are permitted to provide, the default rates of our former students may be negatively impacted. Such attention could also lead to Congressional proposals to increase the measuring period, which could negatively impact our default rates. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we would be able to effectively improve our default rates or improve them in a timely manner to meet the requirements for continued participation in Title IV programs if we experience a substantial increase in our student loan default rates.\nIf we fail to maintain any of our state authorizations, we would lose our ability to operate in that state and to participate in Title IV programs there.\nInstitutions that participate in Title IV programs must be authorized to operate by the appropriate postsecondary regulatory authority in each state where the institution has a physical presence. Prior to July 1, 2011, such authorization was not specifically required for the institution\u2019s students to become eligible for Title IV programs. Under the program integrity rules adopted by the Department effective July 1, 2011, institutions are required to obtain specific regulatory approval to operate in such states. University of Phoenix is specifically authorized to operate in all of the domestic jurisdictions in which it operates. Some states assert authority to regulate all degree-granting institutions if their educational programs are available to their residents, whether or not the institutions maintain a physical presence within those states. University of Phoenix has obtained licensure in states which require such licensure and where students are enrolled.\nThe U.S. Department of Education may adopt debt forgiveness regulations that could lead to liability for amounts based on borrower defenses or affect the Department\u2019s assessment of our institutional capability.\nOn August 20, 2015, the U.S. Department of Education announced its intention to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed regulations (collectively, the \u201cDebt Forgiveness Regulations\u201d) for determining the criteria the Department will use to identify acts or omissions of an institution that constitute defenses to repayment of Federal Direct Loans, and standards and procedures to determine liability of an institution for amounts based on borrower defenses. The committee will also propose rules to determine the effect that borrower defenses to loan repayment may have on the Department\u2019s assessment of institutional capability. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of this rulemaking process or how any such resulting rules would be enforced. Should the Department adopt rules proposed by the negotiated rulemaking committee, or rules in furtherance of the objectives of the rulemaking committee, they may include rules that serve as a basis for recovery of losses arising from loan forgiveness from Title IV participating institutions. Depending on the processes and standards that may be adopted by the Department in the Debt Forgiveness Regulations, which we cannot predict at this time, the outcome of any legal proceeding instituted by a private party or governmental authority or the facts asserted therein could collaterally serve as the basis for liability for amounts based on borrower defenses or the termination of eligibility to participate in the Title IV program based on the Department\u2019s institutional capability assessment. Such liability or termination of eligibility could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 30\nNon-U.S. Operations\nOur non-U.S. operations are subject to risks not inherent in our U.S. operations, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe operate physical and online educational institutions in the United Kingdom, Australia, Mexico, South Africa, Brazil, Chile and elsewhere, and we are actively seeking further expansion in other countries, including India, where we offer educational programs through a joint venture. Our operations in each of the relevant foreign jurisdictions are subject to regulatory requirements relating to education providers, as well as foreign businesses. Many foreign countries have not fully embraced the proprietary education model, and in other countries, proprietary education remains controversial. As a result, our foreign operations are subject to the political risk that existing regulations will be interpreted unfavorably or new regulations will be adopted that render our business model impractical. In addition, our non-U.S. operations are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act which require extensive compliance vigilance on our part and, in some cases, puts our foreign operations at a competitive disadvantage with local companies. If one or more of our foreign operations ceases to be economically practical, we may be forced to discontinue such operations or seek a buyer, either of which might result in a substantial loss of value to Apollo Education Group.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe face intense and increasing competition in the postsecondary education market from both public and private educational institutions, which has adversely affected our business.\nPostsecondary education in our existing and new market areas is highly competitive and is becoming increasingly so as the industry is undergoing profound change at an unprecedented rate. We compete primarily with traditional public and private degree-granting regionally accredited colleges and universities, other proprietary degree-granting regionally accredited schools and alternatives to higher education. In addition, we face increasing competition from various emerging non-traditional, credit-bearing and noncredit-bearing education programs, offered by both proprietary and not-for-profit providers. Some of our competitors have greater financial and nonfinancial resources than we have and are able to offer programs similar to ours at a lower tuition level for a variety of reasons, including the availability of direct and indirect government subsidies, government and foundation grants, large endowments, tax-deductible contributions and other financial resources not available to proprietary institutions, or by providing fewer student services or larger class sizes. For example, a typical community college is subsidized by local or state government and, as a result, tuition rates for associate\u2019s degree programs are much lower at community colleges than at University of Phoenix. Legislation has also been introduced in Congress that would pay for two years of community and technical colleges for first-time students who enroll on at least a half-time basis and maintain satisfactory academic progress. Also, like University of Phoenix, other proprietary educational institutions have begun to deploy pricing incentives to impact demand. We believe that price competition through targeted programs involving student scholarships and otherwise will increase throughout the industry in the future. We have implemented scholarships and discounts which reduce the amount of tuition we receive, and further downward pressure on our tuition rates may cause us to implement further pricing incentives, which will adversely affect our revenue.\nIn addition, one of our primary competitive advantages has been materially diminished as a significant and increasing number of traditional four-year and community colleges offer an increasing array of distance learning and other online education programs, including programs that are geared towards the needs of working learners. This trend has been accelerated by private companies that provide and/or manage online learning platforms for traditional four-year colleges and community colleges. As the proportion of traditional colleges and universities providing alternative learning modalities increases, we will face increased competition from these institutions, including those with highly regarded reputations, the degrees from which are perceived as more valuable in the workplace. Already, this type of competition is significant and has contributed to the substantial decline in University of Phoenix enrollment over the past five years.\nFurthermore, as discussed below, University of Phoenix expects to implement enhanced minimum admissions criteria to better ensure that newly enrolled students are adequately prepared for the rigors of higher education. Many of the students who do not meet these enhanced admissions criteria will not be eligible for admission to traditional four-year colleges and universities. Accordingly, these new admissions standards will increase the proportion of University of Phoenix\u2019s potential students for which the University competes directly with the traditional educational institutions, further intensifying competition.\nAdditionally, the total postsecondary student population has recently declined, with the proprietary share disproportionately affected. Enrollment in Title IV program eligible postsecondary degree-granting institutions in spring 2015 decreased 2%, compared to spring 2014, with the largest decrease of 5% taking place among four-year proprietary institutions. Although the U.S. Department of Education projects that enrollment in degree-granting, postsecondary institutions will grow 12% over the ten-year period ending in the fall of 2022 to approximately 23.5 million students, this projected growth compares with a 24.3% increase reported in the prior ten-year period ended in 2012, when enrollment increased from 16.6 million students in 2002 to approximately 20.6 million students in 2012.\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 31\nThe combination of flat or declining postsecondary student population and increased capacity in the postsecondary education sector will further intensify competition.\nThis intense competition makes it more challenging for us to enroll students who are likely to succeed in our educational programs, and has contributed to the more than 50% decline in degreed enrollment at University of Phoenix since 2010 and put downward pressure on our tuition rates. We must adapt our business to meet these competitive challenges. The recently launched transformation of University of Phoenix to a more focused institution, as discussed below, is intended to address these competitive challenges.\nWe have launched a set of initiatives to transform University of Phoenix into a more focused institution; these initiatives will further reduce the University\u2019s enrollment in the short-term and may not be successful in improving enrollment and retention in the longer term.\nWe are working to transform University of Phoenix into a more focused, higher retaining and less complex institution in order to improve student outcomes and stabilize enrollment. In furtherance of this, the University is implementing several important initiatives, as described in Part I, Item 1, Business - University of Phoenix. These initiatives require significant time, energy and resources, and involve many significant interrelated and simultaneous changes in the University\u2019s processes and programs. We believe these initiatives, taken as a whole, will negatively and significantly impact new enrollment in the short-term, and there is no assurance that we will succeed in achieving our objectives of improving enrollment, student retention, graduation rates and cost to enroll in the longer-term. If our efforts are not successful, University of Phoenix enrollment may continue to decline further and our business and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.\nOur financial performance depends on our ability to continue to develop favorable awareness among, and enroll and retain students; adverse publicity has negatively impacted demand for our programs.\nBuilding favorable awareness of our schools and the programs we offer is critical to our ability to attract prospective students. We expend significant resources on marketing. To the extent that our schools are unable to successfully market and advertise their educational programs, our schools\u2019 ability to attract and enroll prospective students in such programs will be adversely affected. It is also critical to our success that we convert these prospective students to enrolled students in a cost-effective manner and that these enrolled students remain active in our programs.\nIn recent years, University of Phoenix has reduced its use of third-party operated sites and increased its use of branded media channels in order to better manage its marketing message, improve the University\u2019s ability to identify students more likely to persist in its educational programs and reduce cost. Effective October 1, 2015, the University discontinued substantially all use of such third-party operated sites, which accounted for approximately 9% of University of Phoenix New Degreed Enrollment in fiscal year 2015 and represented the marketing channel with the highest cost per New Degreed Enrollment. We expect that this change will negatively impact New Degreed Enrollment in at least the short-term.\nIn addition, the proprietary postsecondary education sector is under regulatory and other scrutiny which has led to media attention that has portrayed the sector in an unflattering light. This negative media attention has caused and may continue to cause some prospective students to choose educational alternatives outside of the proprietary sector or proprietary alternatives other than University of Phoenix, either of which could continue to negatively impact our new enrollments.\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 32\nSome of the additional factors that could prevent us from successfully enrolling and retaining students in our programs include:\n\u2022\nIncreased competition from schools offering distance learning and other online educational programs;\n\u2022\nA decrease in the perceived or actual economic benefits that students derive from our programs or education in general;\n\u2022\nA decrease in or perceived low student pass rates for professional licenses and other examinations necessary for students to work in their chosen field;\n\u2022\nRegulatory investigations that may damage our reputation;\n\u2022\nIncreased regulation of online education, including in states in which we do not have a physical presence;\n\u2022\nLitigation that may damage our reputation;\n\u2022\nInability to continue to recruit, train and retain quality faculty;\n\u2022\nStudent or employer dissatisfaction with the quality of our services and programs;\n\u2022\nTuition rate reductions by competitors that we are unwilling or unable to match;\n\u2022\nA decline in the acceptance of online education;\n\u2022\nUnavailability of ground locations where students want to attend; and\n\u2022\nDisruptions to our information technology systems.\nIf one or more of these factors reduces demand for our programs, our enrollment could be further negatively affected or our costs associated with each new enrollment could increase, or both, either of which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nOur financial performance depends, in part, on our ability to keep pace with changing education market needs; if we fail to keep pace or fail in implementing or adapting to new educational offerings and technologies, our business may be adversely affected.\nThe nature of the skills required by employers can evolve rapidly in today\u2019s changing economic and technological environment. Accordingly, it is important for our schools\u2019 educational programs to evolve in response to economic and technological changes. The expansion of existing programs and the development of new programs, including the changes discussed above to transform University of Phoenix, may not be accepted by current or prospective students or the employers of our graduates. Even if our schools are able to develop acceptable new programs, our schools may not be able to begin offering those new programs as quickly as required by prospective employers or as quickly as our competitors offer similar programs. In addition, we may be unable to obtain specialized accreditations or licensures that may make certain programs desirable to students. To offer a new academic program, we may be required to obtain federal, state and accrediting agency approvals, which may be conditioned or delayed in a manner that could significantly affect our growth plans. In addition, to be eligible for Title IV programs, a new academic program may need to be certified by the U.S. Department of Education. If we are unable to adequately respond to changes in market requirements due to regulatory or financial constraints, unusually rapid technological changes, or other factors, our ability to attract and retain students could be impaired, the rates at which our graduates obtain jobs involving their fields of study could suffer, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nEstablishing new academic programs or modifying existing programs requires us to make investments, incur marketing expenses and reallocate other resources. We may have limited experience with the courses in new areas and may need to modify our systems and strategy or enter into arrangements with other educational institutions to provide new programs effectively and profitably. If we are unable to increase the number of students or offer new programs in a cost-effective manner, or are otherwise unable to manage effectively the operations of newly established academic programs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we do not maintain existing, and develop additional, relationships with employers, our business may be impaired.\nWe currently have relationships with large employers to provide their employees with the opportunity to obtain degrees and professional development certificates through us while continuing their employment. These relationships are an important part of our strategy as they provide us with potential working learners for particular programs and also serve to increase our reputation among high-profile employers. In addition, degree-granting programs in which employers directly pay tuition have a beneficial impact on our 90/10 Rule percentage calculation by reducing the proportion of our cash basis revenues attributable to Title IV program funds. If we are unable to develop new relationships or further develop our existing relationships, if our existing relationships deteriorate or end, or if we are unable to offer programs that teach skills demanded by employers, our efforts to seek these sources of potential working learners may be impaired, and this could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition and our compliance with applicable regulations.\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 33\nOur acquisitions may not be successful and may result in additional debt or dilution to our shareholders, which could adversely affect our business.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we are actively considering acquisition opportunities worldwide. We have acquired and expect to acquire additional proprietary educational institutions that complement our strategic direction, some of which could be material. Any acquisition involves significant risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nInability to successfully integrate the acquired operations, including the information technology systems, into our institutions and maintain uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures;\n\u2022\nInability to successfully operate and grow the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nDistraction of management\u2019s attention from normal business operations;\n\u2022\nChallenges retaining the key employees of the acquired operation;\n\u2022\nOperating, market or other challenges causing operating results to be less than projected;\n\u2022\nExpenses associated with the acquisition;\n\u2022\nNoncontrolling shareholder options that could require us to purchase shares in certain of our businesses that we do not wholly-own;\n\u2022\nChallenges relating to conforming non-compliant financial reporting procedures to those required of a subsidiary of a U.S. reporting company, including procedures required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; and\n\u2022\nUnidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence process, including commitments and/or contingencies.\nAcquisitions are inherently risky. We have experienced many challenges in connection with our previous acquisitions and cannot be certain that any future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business and financial condition. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities, acquire institutions on favorable terms, or successfully integrate or profitably operate acquired institutions. Future transactions may involve use of our cash resources, issuance of equity or debt securities, incurrence of other forms of debt or a significant increase in our financial leverage, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition, especially if the cash flows associated with any acquisition are not sufficient to cover the additional debt service and could negatively impact our compliance with the U.S. Department of Education composite score measure of financial responsibility. If we issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition, current shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership and earnings per share may be diluted. In addition, our acquisition of an educational institution could be considered a change in ownership and control of the acquired institution under applicable regulatory standards. For such an acquisition in the U.S., we may need approval from the U.S. Department of Education and applicable state agencies and accrediting agencies and possibly other regulatory bodies. Our inability to obtain such approvals with respect to a completed acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 34\nOur expansion into new markets outside the U.S. subjects us to risks inherent in international operations.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have acquired schools and universities outside the U.S. and we intend to actively pursue further acquisitions. To the extent that we make such acquisitions, we will face risks that are inherent in international operations, including:\n\u2022\nComplexity of operations across borders;\n\u2022\nCompliance with foreign regulatory environments, including laws and regulations hindering proprietary education enterprises;\n\u2022\nChanges in existing laws to prohibit or restrict proprietary education, whether arising from public discontent or otherwise;\n\u2022\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations and/or price controls or restrictions on exchange of foreign currencies;\n\u2022\nMonetary policy risks, such as inflation, hyperinflation and deflation;\n\u2022\nPotential political and economic instability in the countries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nExpropriation of assets by local governments;\n\u2022\nMultiple and possibly overlapping and conflicting tax laws;\n\u2022\nCompliance with anti-corruption regulations such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010;\n\u2022\nPotential unionization of employees under local labor laws and local labor laws that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate with, retain or terminate employees;\n\u2022\nGreater difficulty in utilizing and enforcing any acquired intellectual property and contract rights;\n\u2022\nInvestment and execution missteps due to a failure to understand the local culture and market;\n\u2022\nLimitations on the repatriation of funds; and\n\u2022\nIncreased risk of acts of terrorism and war, epidemics and natural disasters.\nAny one or more of these risks could negatively impact our non-U.S. operations and materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nSystem disruptions to our computer networks or phone systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe performance and reliability of our computer network and phone systems infrastructure at our schools, including our online programs, is critical to our operations, reputation and ability to attract and retain students. From time to time we experience intermittent outages of the information technology systems used by our students and by our employees, including system-wide outages. Any computer system error or failure, regardless of cause, could result in a substantial outage that materially disrupts our online and ground operations. Not all of our critical systems are protected by a validated formal disaster recovery plan and redundant disaster recovery infrastructure at a geographically remote data center. We are continuing execution of our plan to implement disaster recovery infrastructure for our remaining critical systems to allow timely recovery from catastrophic failure. For those systems not yet protected, a catastrophic failure or unavailability for any reason of our principal data center may require us to replicate the function of this data center at our existing remote data facility or elsewhere, and could result in the loss of data. An event such as this may require service restoration activities that could take up to several weeks to complete.\nWe have upgraded or are in the process of upgrading a substantial portion of our key IT systems, including our online student classroom, student relationship and communications management platform, and corporate applications, and retiring the related legacy systems. Although these new systems are expected to improve the productivity, scalability, reliability and sustainability of our IT infrastructure, the transition from the legacy systems entails risk of unanticipated disruption or failure to fully replicate all necessary data processing and reporting functions, including in our core business functions.\nAny disruption in our IT systems, including any disruptions and system malfunctions that may arise from our substantial IT systems upgrade initiative currently underway or outsourcing initiatives, could significantly impact our operations, reduce student and prospective student confidence in our educational institutions, adversely affect our compliance with applicable regulations and accrediting body standards and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Although we maintain insurance in respect of some types of these disruptions, there is no assurance that available insurance proceeds would be adequate to compensate us for damages sustained due to these disruptions.\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 35\nSecurity threats to our computer systems, including breach of the personal information that we collect, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe face an ever increasing number of threats to our computer systems, including unauthorized activity and access, malicious penetration, system viruses, malicious code and organized cyber-attacks, which could breach our security and disrupt our systems. These risks increase when we are making changes to our IT systems, such as our substantial IT systems upgrade initiative currently underway and our frequent updates to enable instructional innovation and address new student populations. Our size makes us a prominent target for hacking and other cyber-attacks within the education industry. From time to time we experience security events and incidents, and these reflect an increasing level of malicious sophistication, organization and innovation. We have devoted and will continue to devote significant resources to the security of our computer systems, but they may still be vulnerable to these threats. A user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in operations, perhaps over an extended period of time prior to detection. As a result, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of or alleviate problems caused by these system disruptions and security breaches. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Although we maintain insurance in respect of these types of events, there is no assurance that available insurance proceeds would be adequate to compensate us for damages sustained due to these events.\nIn addition, possession and use of personal information in our operations subjects us to risks and costs that could harm our business. Our educational institutions collect, use and retain large amounts of personal information regarding our students and their families, including social security numbers, tax return information and personal and family financial data. We also collect and maintain personal information of our employees in the ordinary course of our business. Some of this personal information is held and managed by certain of our vendors. Although we use security and business controls to limit access and use of personal information, a third-party may be able to circumvent those security and business controls, which could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. In addition, errors in the storage, use or transmission of personal information could result in a breach of student or employee privacy, and the increased availability and use of mobile data devices by our employees and students increases the risk of unintentional disclosure of personal information. Possession and use of personal information in our operations also subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that could require notification of data breaches and restrict our use of personal information. We cannot ensure that a breach, loss or theft of personal information will not occur. A breach, theft or loss of personal information regarding our students and their families or our employees that is held by us or our vendors could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and results of operations and result in liability under state and federal privacy statutes and legal actions by state attorneys, general and private litigants, and any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. In August 2015, we received a notice from the Federal Trade Commission that it had commenced an inquiry into the University of Phoenix\u2019s practices and procedures for safeguarding student and staff personal information, with a request for relevant information from the University. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter and we may incur substantial costs and other expenses in connection with our response.\nIf we cannot attract qualified new personnel or retain our existing senior management team, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur future performance depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities. Our future success also depends in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. The loss of the services of our senior management for any reason could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe have experienced a number of changes in senior management in recent years. Our Chief Financial Officer resigned in May 2015, and Gregory J. Iverson, our current Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer, was appointed Chief Financial Officer effective October 26, 2015. A lack of management continuity could result in operational and administrative inefficiencies, make achievement of our strategic and management objectives more challenging and may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. If we are unable to effectively manage our business through these management transitions, our business and results of operation could be adversely affected.\nTo effectively educate our students, we must continue to attract and retain qualified faculty members.\nOur educational institutions employ approximately 23,000 faculty members, a substantial majority of whom are adjunct, part-time faculty. In order to effectively educate our students, we must recruit and train a large number of faculty on an ongoing basis and keep our faculty engaged and focused on the mission of delivering quality education. If we cannot attract and retain sufficient qualified faculty members, or we fail to adequately train new faculty members, or our relations with faculty members deteriorate and lead to work stoppages or other disruptions, our ability to serve our students would be impaired and we may be required to reduce the scope or number of the classes available to our students, any of which could have a material adverse impact our business.\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 36\nIf we are unable to successfully conclude pending litigation and governmental inquiries, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe, certain of our subsidiaries, and certain of our current and former directors and executive officers have been named as defendants in various lawsuits and we have received various governmental inquiries. Refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies and Note 17, Regulatory Matters, in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further discussion of pending litigation and other proceedings. In addition, changes in our business and pending actions by regulators and accreditors may increase the risk of claims.\nWe cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters and expect to incur significant defense costs and other expenses in connection with them. Such costs and expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market price of our common stock. We may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs in excess of our insurance coverage related to these matters, or may be required to pay substantial fines or penalties, any of which could have a further material adverse effect on our financial condition. An adverse outcome in any of these matters could also materially and adversely affect our licenses, accreditations and eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nWe rely on proprietary rights and intellectual property that may not be adequately protected under current laws, and we encounter disputes from time to time relating to our use of intellectual property.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights and intellectual property. We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, domain names and contractual agreements to protect our proprietary rights. For example, we rely on trademark protection in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions to protect our rights to various marks as well as distinctive logos and other marks associated with our services. We also rely on agreements under which we obtain intellectual property to own or license rights to use intellectual property developed by faculty members, content experts and other third-parties. We cannot assure that these measures are adequate, that we have secured, or will be able to secure, appropriate permissions or protections for all of the intellectual property rights we use or claim rights to in the U.S. or various foreign jurisdictions, or that third parties will not terminate our license rights or infringe upon or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others. Despite our efforts to protect these rights, unauthorized third parties may attempt to use, duplicate or copy the proprietary aspects of our student recruitment and educational delivery methods and systems, curricula, online resource material or other content. Our management\u2019s attention may be diverted by these attempts and we may need to use funds in litigation to protect our proprietary rights against any infringement or violation, which could have a material adverse affect on our business and financial condition.\nWe may become party to disputes from time to time over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property, and we may not prevail in these disputes. For example, third parties may allege that we have infringed upon or not obtained sufficient rights in the technologies used in our educational delivery systems, the content of our courses or other training materials or in our ownership or uses of other intellectual property claimed by that third-party. Some third-party intellectual property rights may prove to be extremely broad, and it may not be possible for us to conduct our operations in such a way as to avoid violating those intellectual property rights. Any such intellectual property claim could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether such claim has merit. Our various liability insurance coverages, if any, may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to alter the design and operation of our systems or the content of our courses or pay monetary damages or license fees to third parties, which could have a material adverse affect on our business and financial condition.\nWe may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication, distribution or other use of materials posted online.\nIn some instances, our employees, including faculty members, or our students may post various articles or other third-party content online in class discussion boards or in other venues including Facebook, PhoenixConnect, University of Phoenix\u2019s proprietary social media network, and other social networks. The laws governing the fair use of these third-party materials are imprecise and adjudicated on a case-by-case basis, which makes it challenging to adopt and implement appropriately balanced institutional policies governing these practices. As a result, we could incur liability to third parties for the unauthorized duplication, distribution or other use of this material. Any such claims could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether the claims have merit. Our various liability insurance coverages, if any, may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to alter or cease our uses of such material, which may include changing or removing content from our courses, or pay monetary damages, which could have a material adverse affect on our business and financial condition.\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 37\nWe may have unanticipated tax liabilities that could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to multiple types of taxes in the U.S., United Kingdom and various other foreign jurisdictions. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax accruals involves various judgments, and therefore the ultimate tax determination is subject to uncertainty. In addition, changes in tax laws, regulations, or rules may adversely affect our future reported financial results, may impact the way in which we conduct our business, or may increase the risk of audit by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) or other tax authorities.\nDuring fiscal year 2015, the IRS completed its review of our United States federal income tax return for fiscal year 2014. Our federal income tax return for fiscal year 2013 is currently open for review by the IRS and we are also participating in the IRS\u2019s Compliance Assurance Process for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, which is a voluntary program in which taxpayers seek to resolve all or most issues with the IRS prior to or soon after filing their United States federal income tax returns. Additionally, we are subject to numerous ongoing audits by state, local and foreign tax authorities with various tax years as early as 2007 that remain subject to examination. Although we believe our tax accruals are reasonable, the final determination of tax returns under review or returns that may be reviewed in the future and any related litigation could result in tax liabilities that materially differ from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\nIn addition, an increasing number of states and localities are adopting new laws or changing their interpretation of existing laws regarding the apportionment of service revenues for corporate income tax purposes in a manner that could result in a larger proportion of our income being taxed by the states into which we sell services. These legislative and administrative changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Control Over Our Voting Stock\nOur Class A common stock has no voting rights. The Apollo Class B Voting Stock Trust No. 1 holds approximately 51% of our voting stock and controls substantially all actions requiring the vote or consent of our shareholders, which may discourage or make impractical a takeover and may have an adverse effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nApproximately 51% of our outstanding Class B voting shares, our only class of voting stock, is held by the Apollo Class B Voting Stock Trust No. 1 (the \u201cClass B Trust\u201d), an irrevocable trust of which the current trustees are Peter V. Sperling, Chairman of our Board of Directors, Ms. Terri Bishop, the Vice Chair of our Board of Directors, and Ms. Darby Shupp, a member of our Board of Directors. Mr. Peter Sperling owns the remaining 49% of our outstanding Class B voting stock through a revocable grantor trust. Accordingly, the Class B Trust and Mr. Peter Sperling together control the election of all members of our Board of Directors and substantially all other actions requiring a vote of our shareholders, except in certain limited circumstances. Holders of our outstanding Class A common stock do not have the right to vote for the election of directors or for substantially any other action requiring a vote of shareholders. The trustees of the Class B Trust have the sole power to appoint successor and additional trustees.\nThe control of a majority of our voting stock by the Class B Trust makes it impossible for a third-party to acquire voting control of us without the approval of a majority of the trustees of the Class B Trust. There is no assurance that the Apollo Education Group Class B shareholders, or the trustees of the Class B Trust, will exercise their control of Apollo Education Group in the same manner that a majority of the outstanding Class A shareholders would if they were entitled to vote on actions currently reserved exclusively for our Class B shareholders.\nWe are a \u201cControlled Company\u201d under the Nasdaq Listing Rules and therefore are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements, which could reduce the influence of independent directors on our management and strategic direction.\nWe are a \u201cControlled Company\u201d as defined in Rule 5615(c)(1) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules, because more than 50% of the voting power of our outstanding stock is controlled by the Class B Trust. As a consequence, we are exempt from certain requirements of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605, including that:\n\u2022\nOur Board be composed of a majority of Independent Directors (as defined in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(a)(2));\n\u2022\nThe compensation of our officers be determined by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors; and\n\u2022\nNominations to the Board of Directors be made by a majority of the independent directors or a nominations committee composed solely of independent directors.\nHowever, Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(b)(2) does require that our independent directors have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present (\u201cexecutive sessions\u201d). In addition, Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) requires that a compensation committee of outside directors (within the meaning of Section 162(m)) approve stock option grants to executive officers in order for us to be able to claim deductions for the compensation expense attributable to such stock options. Notwithstanding the foregoing exemptions, we do have a majority of independent directors on our Board of\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 38\nDirectors and we do have an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating and Governance Committee composed entirely of independent directors.\nThe charters for the Compensation Committee, Audit Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee have been adopted by the Board of Directors and are available on our website, www.apollo.edu. These charters provide, among other items, that each member must be independent as such term is defined by the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nIf in the future our Board of Directors elects to rely on the exemptions permitted by the Nasdaq Listing Rules and reduce the number or proportion of independent directors on our Board and its key committees, the influence of independent directors on our management and strategy would be reduced and the influence of the holders of our Class B voting common stock on our management and strategy would increase.\nIf regulators do not approve or delay their approval of transactions involving a change of control of our company, our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, our accreditation and our state licenses may be impaired in a manner that materially and adversely affects our business.\nA change of ownership or control of Apollo Education Group, depending on the type of change, may have significant regulatory consequences for University of Phoenix. Such a change of ownership or control could require recertification by the U.S. Department of Education, the reevaluation of accreditation by The Higher Learning Commission and/or reauthorization by state licensing agencies. If we experience a change of ownership or control, then University of Phoenix and certain of our other subsidiaries may cease to be eligible to participate in Title IV programs until recertified by the Department. The continuing participation of University of Phoenix in Title IV programs is critical to our business. Any disruption in its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs would materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, University of Phoenix is required to report any material change in stock ownership to its principal institutional accrediting body, The Higher Learning Commission, and would be required to obtain approval prior to undergoing any transaction that affects, or may affect, its corporate control or governance. In the event of any such change, The Higher Learning Commission may undertake an evaluation of the effect of the change on the continuing operations of University of Phoenix for purposes of determining if continued accreditation is appropriate, which evaluation may include a comprehensive review. If the Commission determines that the change is such that prior approval by the Commission was required, but was not obtained, the Commission\u2019s policies require it to consider withdrawal of accreditation. If accreditation by The Higher Learning Commission is suspended or withdrawn, University of Phoenix would not be eligible to participate in Title IV programs until the accreditation is reinstated by the Commission or is obtained from another appropriate accrediting body. There is no assurance that reinstatement of accreditation could be obtained on a timely basis, if at all, and accreditation from a different qualified accrediting authority, if available, would require a significant amount of time. Any material disruption in accreditation would materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, some states in which University of Phoenix is licensed require approval (in some cases, advance approval) of changes in ownership or control in order to remain authorized to operate in those states, and participation in grant programs in some states may be interrupted or otherwise affected by a change in ownership or control.\nAs discussed above, approximately 51% of our outstanding Class B voting stock, our only class of voting stock, is held by the Class B Trust, and Mr. Peter Sperling beneficially owns the remaining 49% of such shares. A future change in trustees of the Class B Trust, whether resulting from resignation, death, disability or otherwise, may be considered to be a change of control by the Department of Education, The Higher Learning Commission or other regulatory authorities, depending on the circumstances.\nWe cannot prevent a change of ownership or control that would arise from a transfer of voting stock by the Class B Trust or Mr. Peter Sperling, including a transfer that may occur or be deemed to occur upon the resignation, death or incompetency of one or more of the trustees of the Class B Trust.", "PERMNO": 81138, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "APOL"}
