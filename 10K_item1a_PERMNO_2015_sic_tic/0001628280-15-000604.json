{"cik": "1105184", "company": "NANOSPHERE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur results from operations may be affected by the risk factors set forth below. All investors should consider the following risk factors before deciding to purchase securities of the Company. If any of the following events actually occur, our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment. The risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations and could result in a complete loss of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of losses and we may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have a limited operating history and have incurred significant losses in each fiscal year since our inception, including net losses of $39.1 million, $34.6 million and $32.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $421.9 million. Our losses resulted principally from costs incurred in our research and development programs and from our general and administrative expenses. In recent years, we have incurred significant costs in connection with the development of the Verigene System and its test menu. We expect our research and development expense levels to remain high for the foreseeable future as we seek to enhance our existing product, and simultaneously develop new products. These losses, among other things, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our working capital, total assets and stockholders\u2019 equity. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our product development and commercialization efforts, we are unable to predict when we will become profitable. The Company\u2019s recurring losses from operations and continued use of cash to fund operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur financial results depend on commercial acceptance of the Verigene System, its array of tests, and the development of additional tests.\nOur future depends on the success of the Verigene System, which depends primarily on its acceptance by hospitals, research institutions, and independent diagnostic laboratories as a reliable, accurate and cost-effective replacement for traditional molecular diagnostic measurement methods. Many hospitals and laboratories already use expensive molecular diagnostic testing instruments in their laboratories and therefore, may be reluctant to change their current procedures for performing such analysis.\nThe Verigene System currently does not process a sufficiently broad menu of tests nor volume of samples for some hospitals and laboratories to consider adopting it. Although we continue to develop additional tests to respond to\nhospitals\u2019 and laboratories\u2019 needs, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to develop enough additional tests quickly enough, or in a manner that is cost-effective, or at all. The development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process, requiring the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends, as well as precise technological execution. We are currently not able to estimate when, or if we will be able to develop, commercialize or sell additional tests or enhance existing products. If we are unable to increase sales of the Verigene System and its tests, or to successfully develop and commercialize additional products or tests, our revenues and our ability to achieve profitability would be impaired.\nThe report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our 2014 financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern which may increase attention by current and future customers, vendors and future inventors on our financial position. We will need additional financing to execute our business plan, to fund our operations and to continue as a going concern.\nSince inception, we have experienced recurring operating losses and negative cash flows and we expect to continue to generate operating losses and consume significant cash resources for the foreseeable future. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern without additional financing. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our 2014 financial statements with respect to this uncertainty. Substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern may materially and adversely affect the price per share of our common stock and we may have a more difficult time obtaining financing.\nThe explanatory paragraph in the report of our independent registered public accounting firm may increase awareness and concern of our financial position and impact our relationships with current and future customers, vendors and future investors.\nWe have prepared our financial statements on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Our 2014 financial statements do not include any adjustment to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nWe will require additional capital to continue as a going concern.\nWe currently do not have sufficient capital to fully fund the activities needed to commercialize and market our full panel of assays for the Verigene Processor SP to generate net income. As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $21.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, and we anticipate having less than twelve months\u2019 worth of sufficient cash on hand and cash from future operations to fund our operations. As of December 31, 2014, we have three to six months of sufficient capital to fund our operations.\nWe do not anticipate achieving positive operating cash flow in at least the next twelve months. We require increased investment in additional manufacturing scale-up, and to add sales, marketing and customer support personnel during the next twelve months to advance the commercialization of our products. We operate in a market that makes our prospects difficult to evaluate, and achievement of positive cash flow from operations will depend upon revenue resulting from adoption of both our current products and future products that depend upon regulatory clearance. Demand for our respiratory products is directly proportional to the size and duration of the annual season for influenza and other respiratory illnesses. Any unanticipated acceleration or deceleration of customer demand for our product relative to projections will have a material effect on our cash flows.\nOur current and anticipated cash resources will likely be insufficient to support currently forecasted operations beyond the next three to six months, and we will need additional debt or equity financing in the future to execute our business plan and to be able to continue as a going concern. If in the future, we fail to satisfy the continued listing standards of NASDAQ, we may not be able to sell shares of our common stock. Market conditions, including the current historically very low price for our common stock, will likely limit our ability to raise capital on favorable terms, or at all, and the terms of any public or private offerings of debt or equity securities likely would be significantly dilutive to existing shareholders. Management also believes that, if necessary, it can implement plans in the short term to conserve existing cash should additional financing activities be delayed. Capital outlays and operating expenditures that would otherwise increase over the next twelve months as the Company expands its infrastructure, manufacturing capacity and research and development activities to support commercialization of our products may need to be curtailed, which may not be advantageous for the Company\u2019s business operations.\nWe cannot guarantee that we would be able to obtain any of the additional debt or equity financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and we may continue to evaluate a full range of potential strategic alternatives.\nAdditional equity funding could be dilutive to existing stockholders. If we fail to obtain the necessary debt or equity financing when needed, we may not be able to execute our planned development and commercialization efforts, which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy and our results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to generate sufficient capital from operations or raise additional funds, we will need to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\ndelay, scale-back, or eliminate research and development of some or all of assays or the next generation Verigene System;\n\u2022\nlicense third parties to develop and commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to develop and commercialize ourselves;\n\u2022\naccelerate our exploration of strategic alternatives, including attempting to sell our company which could then be on disadvantageous terms;\n\u2022\ncease operations; or\n\u2022\nfile for bankruptcy.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing events would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy and our results of operations and financial condition, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to continue as a going concern.\nIf we default on our loan agreement with Silicon Valley Bank and Oxford Finance LLC, we may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nUnder the terms of our loan agreement with Silicon Valley Bank and Oxford Finance LLC, a material adverse change in the Company\u2019s financial condition could trigger an event of default. If an event of default occurs, all amounts owing under the loan agreement (currently approximately $10 million) would become immediately due and payable and Oxford Finance LLC, as collateral agent, could move against the collateral, including the seizure of our cash and cash equivalents that we maintain in accounts with Oxford Finance LLC. All of our cash is currently held in accounts with Oxford Finance LLC. While the Company does not believe that such an event of default has occurred, Silicon Valley Bank or Oxford Finance LLC may take a contrary position. If an event of default were to occur, such actions by the collateral agent would have an immediate and substantial negative effect on our ability to continue as a going concern, as it would reduce our cash reserves to approximately $10 million as of December 31, 2014 which would provide working capital for only up to three months from that date.\nOur ability to issue additional shares of our common stock without shareholder approval is limited.\nAfter the issuance of shares of our common stock in the underwritten public offering that we completed on October 27, 2014, we have approximately 22.6 million unissued and unreserved shares of common stock authorized for issuance under our certificate of incorporation. We will not be able to raise additional capital through the sale of additional shares of common stock in excess of our remaining authorized shares of common stock without shareholder approval of an amendment to our charter to authorize additional shares of capital stock or an amendment to effect a reverse split of our issued and outstanding common stock that would have the same effect as an amendment to authorize additional shares of capital stock. Failure to obtain such shareholder approval would have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise capital and our overall financial condition, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to continue as a going concern.\nA significant amount of our inventory consists of instruments held by prospective customers who are evaluating our products and may not be converted to revenue on the timeframe that we anticipate or at all.\nAs of December 31, 2014, approximately $5.9 million of our inventory consisted of Verigene Processor SP instruments held by customers who are evaluating and testing our products. If a material number of these prospective customers do not adopt the Verigene System or the Processor SP within the time periods that we estimate or at all, then we will not be able to convert the inventory held by these customers to revenues. If we are unable to sell this inventory to other customers or if it becomes obsolete as we develop Atlas, our next generation Processor SP, we may be required to write off a significant portion of this inventory.\nThe regulatory approval process is expensive, time consuming and uncertain and the failure to obtain such approvals will prevent us from commercializing our future products.\nOur products are subject to approval or clearance by the FDA or foreign governmental entities prior to their marketing for commercial use. The 510(k) clearance and premarket approval processes as well as the foreign approvals required to initiate sales outside the United States can be expensive, time consuming and uncertain. It may take as long as eighteen months or longer from submission to obtain 510(k) clearance, and from one to three years from submission to obtain premarket approval; however, it may take longer, and 510(k) clearance or premarket approval may never be obtained. Delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, clearances or approvals for future products, including tests that are currently in development, would result in delayed, or no realization of revenues from such products, and in substantial additional costs, which could decrease our profitability. Relative to larger organizations, we have limited experience in filing FDA applications for 510(k) clearance and premarket approval. There are no assurances that we will obtain any required clearance or approval. Any such failure, or any material delay in obtaining the clearance or approval, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and our customers are subject to various governmental regulations, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with, and experience delays in our product commercialization as a result of these regulations.\nThe products we develop, manufacture and market are subject to regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. We generally are prohibited from marketing our products in the United States unless we obtain either 510(k) clearance or premarket approval from the FDA.\nIn addition, we are required to continue to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once we have obtained 510(k) clearance or PMA approval for a product. These requirements include the Quality System Regulation, labeling requirements, the FDA\u2019s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or \u201coff-label\u201d uses and adverse event reporting regulations. Failure to comply with applicable FDA product regulatory requirements could result in warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, repairs, replacements, refunds, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, the FDA\u2019s refusal to grant future pre-market clearances or approvals, withdrawals or suspensions of current product applications and criminal prosecution. Any of these actions, in combination or alone, could prevent us from selling our products and would likely harm our business.\nOur manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic regulatory inspections by the FDA and other federal and state regulatory agencies. The use of our diagnostic products by our customers is also affected by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or \u201cCLIA\u201d, and related federal and state regulations that provide for regulation of laboratory testing. CLIA is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the United States by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality and inspections. Current or future CLIA requirements or the promulgation of additional regulations affecting laboratory testing may prevent some laboratories from using some or all of our diagnostic products. In January 2015, we received a warning letter from the FDA relating to deficiencies in our quality system regulation. Although we are committed to addressing the issues raised by the FDA, there can be no assurance that the FDA will be satisfied with the steps we have taken to address the issues or that the FDA will not raise additional areas of concern. We may be subject to additional regulatory action by the FDA, including product seizures, injunctions and/or civil money penalties and any such actions could have an adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nThe FDA and foreign governmental regulators have made, and may continue to make, changes in approval requirements and processes. We cannot predict what these changes will be, how or when they will occur, or what effect they will have on the regulation of our products. Any new regulations, including regulations specifically related to nanotechnology, may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of our products. Delays in receipt of, or failure to receive regulatory approvals or clearances for our new products, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf third-party payors do not reimburse our customers for the use of our clinical diagnostic products or if they reduce reimbursement levels, our ability to sell our products will be harmed.\nWe intend to sell our products primarily to hospital-based laboratories and academic research institutions, substantially all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services they provide to their patients from third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and other domestic and international government programs, private insurance plans and managed care programs. Most of these third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a medical product\nwas not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for an unapproved indication. Third-party payors also may refuse to reimburse for procedures and devices deemed to be experimental.\nIn the United States, the American Medical Association assigns specific Current Procedural Terminology (\"CPT\") codes, which are necessary for reimbursement of diagnostic tests. Once the CPT code is established, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services establish reimbursement payment levels and coverage rules under Medicaid and Medicare, and private payors establish rates and coverage rules independently. Although the tests performed by our assays in development have previously assigned CPT Codes, we cannot guarantee that our assays are covered by such CPT codes and are therefore approved for reimbursement by Medicare and Medicaid as well as most third-party payors. Additionally, certain of our future products may not be approved for reimbursement. Third-party payors may choose to reimburse our customers on a per test basis, rather than on the basis of the number of results given by the test. This may result in reference laboratories, public health institutions and hospitals electing to use separate tests to screen for each disease so that they can receive reimbursement for each test they conduct. In that event, these entities likely would purchase separate tests for each disease, rather than products that multiplex. Third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services. Increasingly, Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors are challenging the prices charged for medical services, including clinical diagnostic tests. Levels of reimbursement may decrease in the future, and future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payors may adversely affect the demand for and price levels of our products. If our customers are not reimbursed for our products, they may reduce or discontinue purchases of our products, which would cause our revenues to decline.\nWe may fail to receive positive clinical results from the diagnostic tests currently in development that require clinical trials, and even if we receive positive clinical results, we may still fail to receive the necessary clearances or approvals to market our products.\nWe are investing in the research and development of new products to expand the menu of testing options for the Verigene System. In order to commercialize our products, we are required to undertake time consuming and costly development activities, sometimes including clinical trials for which the outcome is uncertain. Products that appear promising during early development and preclinical studies may, nonetheless, fail to demonstrate the results needed to support regulatory approval. Even if we receive positive clinical results, we may still fail to obtain the necessary FDA 510(k) clearance and approvals.\nOur operating results may be variable and unpredictable.\nThe sales cycles for our products may be lengthy, which will make it difficult for us to accurately forecast revenues in a given period, and may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly from period to period. In addition to its length, the sales cycle associated with our products is subject to a number of significant risks, including the budgetary constraints of our customers, their inventory management practices and possibly internal acceptance reviews, all of which are beyond our control. Sales of our products will also involve the purchasing decisions of large, medium and small hospitals and laboratories which can require many levels of pre-approvals, further lengthening sales time. As a result, we may expend considerable resources on unsuccessful sales efforts or we may not be able to complete transactions on the anticipated schedule.\nIf we do not achieve our projected development goals in the quantities or time frames we estimate, the commercialization of our products may be delayed and our business prospects may suffer. The assumptions underlying our product placement and development goals also may prove to be materially inaccurate.\nFrom time to time, we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory and other product development goals. These goals may include the commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials, the timing and number of product placements and the submission of regulatory filings. We also may disclose projected expenditures or other forecasts for future periods in information that we furnish to the SEC from time to time. These and other projections are based on management\u2019s current expectations and may not contain sufficient margin of error, or cushion for any specific uncertainties, or for the uncertainties inherent in all forecasting. The actual timing of our product placement and development goals and actual expenditures or other financial results can vary dramatically compared to our estimates, in some cases for reasons beyond our control. If we do not meet projections as announced from time to time, the development, placement and commercialization of our products may be delayed and our business prospects may suffer. The assumptions management has used to produce these projections may significantly change or prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, one should not unduly rely on any of these forward-looking statements.\nIf we do not achieve significant product revenue, we may not be able to meet our cash requirements without obtaining additional capital from external sources, and if we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail or cease operations.\nWe expect capital outlays and operating expenditures to increase over the next few years as we expand our infrastructure, commercialization, manufacturing, and research and development activities. Our current cash and cash equivalents are not sufficient to meet our estimated needs for the next twelve months. We operate in a market that makes our prospects difficult to evaluate, and we will need additional financing to execute on our current or future business strategies. The amount and the timing of the additional capital we will need to raise depends on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe level of research and development investment required to maintain and improve our technology;\n\u2022\nthe amount and growth rate, if any, of our revenues;\n\u2022\nchanges in product development plans needed to address any difficulties in manufacturing or commercializing the Verigene System and enhancements to our system;\n\u2022\nthe costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\ncompeting technological and market developments;\n\u2022\nour need or decision to acquire or license complementary technologies or acquire complementary businesses;\n\u2022\nthe expansion of our sales force; and\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory policies, practices or laws that affect our operations, including clearance to market our products.\nWe cannot be certain that additional capital will be available when and as needed, or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated. If we require additional capital at a time when investment in diagnostics companies or in the marketplace in general is limited due to the then prevailing market or other conditions, we may not be able to raise such funds at the time that we desire, or any time thereafter. In addition, if we raise additional funds through the issuance of common stock or convertible securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted, and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. If we obtain additional debt financing, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness, and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations. If we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our technologies or products, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nOur ability to use net operating losses and tax credits to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nWe currently have significant net operating losses (\"NOLs\") and tax credits that may be used to offset future taxable income. In general, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs and tax credits to offset future taxable income. Our underwritten public offering of common stock or future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result, or may have already resulted, in an ownership change under Sections 382 and 383.\nThe adverse capital and credit market conditions could continue to affect our liquidity.\nAdverse capital and credit market conditions could continue to affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, as well as our access to capital and cost of capital. The capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption for more than 12 months. Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and capital position could be materially adversely affected by continued disruptions in the capital and credit markets.\nIf our products do not perform as expected or the reliability of the technology on which our products are based is questioned, we could experience lost revenue, delayed or reduced market acceptance of our products, increased costs and damage to our reputation.\nOur success depends on the market\u2019s confidence that we can provide reliable, high-quality diagnostics systems. We believe that customers in our target markets are likely to be particularly sensitive to product defects and errors.\nOur reputation and the public image of our products or technologies may be impaired if our products fail to perform as expected or our products are perceived as difficult to use. Our products are complex and may develop or contain undetected defects or errors. Any defects or errors could lead to the filing of product liability claims, which could be costly and time-consuming to defend and result in substantial damages. If we experience a sustained material defect or error, this could result in loss or delay of revenues, delayed market acceptance, damaged reputation, diversion of development resources, legal claims, increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs, any of which could materially harm our business. We cannot assure that our product liability insurance would protect our assets from the financial impact of defending a product liability claim. A product liability claim could have a serious adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party license agreements for patents and other technology related to our products, and the termination of these agreements could delay or prevent us from being able to commercialize our products.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our patent portfolio is comprised, on a worldwide basis, of 189 issued patents and six pending patent applications which we own directly or for which we are the exclusive licensee. Some of these patents and patent applications derive from a common parent patent application or are foreign counterpart patent applications and relate to similar or identical technological claims. The issued patents cover approximately nine different technological claims and the pending patent applications cover approximately three additional technological claims.\nMany of our issued and pending patents were exclusively licensed from the International Institute for Nanotechnology at Northwestern in May 2000, and they generally cover our core technology, including nanotechnology-based biodiagnostics and biobarcode technology. Our issued patents expire between 2017 and 2025. We cannot assure that any of our licenses will continue in force for as long as we require for the development and commercialization of our products, and the early termination of these agreements could delay or prevent us from being able to commercialize our products. As our patent rights expire over time, we may not have commercially meaningful protection for our products or a commercial advantage against our competitors or their competitive products or processes. We believe our patent portfolio provides protection against other companies offering products employing the same technologies and methods as we have patented. While we believe our patent portfolio establishes a proprietary position, there are many competitive products utilizing other technologies that do not infringe on our patents.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2014, we have non-exclusive licenses for at least 31 U.S. patents that cover nine different technological claims from various third parties. Most of these license agreements require us to pay the licensor royalty fees that typically expire upon the patent expiration dates, which range from 2015 to 2027. These license agreements are non-exclusive and do not create a proprietary position. The expiration of these non-exclusive licenses will result in the termination of certain royalty payments by us to the licensors.\nIf we are unable to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property protection covering our products, others may be able to make, use, or sell our products or substantially similar products, which could adversely affect our ability to compete in the market.\nOur success is dependent in part on obtaining, maintaining and enforcing intellectual property rights, including patents. If we are unable to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property legal protection covering our products, others may be able to make, use or sell products that are substantially identical to ours without incurring the sizeable discovery, development and licensing costs that we have incurred, which would adversely affect our ability to compete in the market.\nWe seek to obtain and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights to restrict the ability of others to market products that compete with our products. As of December 31, 2014, our patent portfolio is comprised, on a worldwide basis, of 189 issued patents and 6 pending patent applications which, in either case, we own directly or for which we are the exclusive licensee. However, patents may not be issued from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and moreover, issued patents owned or licensed to us now or in the future may be found by a court to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable. Also, even if our patents are determined by a court to be valid and enforceable, they may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from marketing products similar to ours or designing around our patents, despite our patent rights, nor provide us with freedom to operate unimpeded by the patent rights of others.\nFurthermore, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the invention claimed in our United States issued patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for protection of the inventions claimed in our foreign issued patents or pending patent applications. In addition, there are numerous recent changes to the patent laws and proposed changes to the rules of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. For example, in September 2011, the U.S. enacted sweeping\nchanges to the U.S. patent system under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, including changes that would transition the U.S. from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system and alter the processes for challenging issued patents. These changes could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. We may become subject to interference proceedings conducted in the patent and trademark offices of various countries to determine our entitlement to patents, and these proceedings may conclude that other patents or patent applications have priority over our patents or patent applications. It is also possible that a competitor may successfully challenge our patents through various proceedings and those challenges may result in the elimination or narrowing of our patents, and therefore reduce our patent protection. Accordingly, rights under any of our issued patents, patent applications or future patents may not provide us with commercially meaningful protection for our products or afford us a commercial advantage against our competitors or their competitive products or processes.\nWe have a number of foreign patents and applications. However, the laws of some foreign jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States, and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. If we encounter such difficulties or we are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions, our business prospects could be substantially harmed.\nWe may initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights, which may prompt our adversaries in such litigation to challenge the validity, scope or enforceability of our patents. Patent litigation is complex and often difficult and expensive, and would consume the time of our management and other significant resources. In addition, the outcome of patent litigation is uncertain. If a court decides that our patents are not valid, not enforceable or of a limited scope, we may not have the right to stop others from using the subject matter covered by those patents. Patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is still evolving and, consequently, patent positions in our industry are generally uncertain. We cannot assure you that we would prevail in any of these suits or that the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, would be commercially valuable. During the course of these suits, there may be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation. Any public announcements related to these suits could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe also rely on trade secret protection to protect our interests in proprietary know-how and for processes for which patents are difficult to obtain or enforce. We may not be able to protect our trade secrets adequately. In addition, we rely on non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, our trade secrets and other proprietary technology. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Moreover, others may independently develop equivalent proprietary information, and third parties may otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge. Any disclosure of confidential data into the public domain or to third parties could allow our competitors to learn our trade secrets and use the information in competition against us.\nOur products could infringe patent rights of others, which may require costly litigation and, if we are not successful, could cause us to pay substantial damages or limit our ability to commercialize our products.\nOur commercial success depends on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We are aware of third party patents that may relate to our products and technology. There may also be other patents that relate to our products and technology of which we are not aware. We may unintentionally infringe upon valid patent rights of third parties. Although we are currently not involved in any material litigation involving patents, a third party patent holder could assert a claim of patent infringement against us in the future. Alternatively, we may initiate litigation against the third party patent holder to request that a court declare that we are not infringing the third party\u2019s patent and/or that the third party\u2019s patent is invalid or unenforceable. If a claim of infringement is asserted against us and is successful, and therefore we are found to infringe, we could be required to pay damages for infringement, including treble damages if it is determined that we knew or became aware of such a patent and we failed to exercise due care in determining whether or not we infringed the patent. If we have supplied infringing products to third parties or have licensed third parties to manufacture, use or market infringing products, we may be obligated to indemnify these third parties for damages they may be required to pay to the patent holder and for any losses they may sustain. We can also be prevented from selling or commercializing any of our products that use the infringing technology in the future, unless we obtain a license from such third party. A license may not be available from such third party on commercially reasonable terms, or may not be available at all. Any modification to include a non-infringing technology may not be possible or if possible may be difficult or time-consuming to develop, and require revalidation, which could delay our ability to commercialize our products.\nAny infringement action asserted against us, even if we are ultimately successful in defending against such action, would likely delay the regulatory approval process of our products, harm our competitive position, be expensive and require the time and attention of our key management and technical personnel.\nWe have limited experience in sales and marketing and may be unable to successfully commercialize our Verigene System, or it may be difficult to build brand loyalty.\nWe have limited marketing, sales and distribution experience and capabilities. Our ability to achieve profitability depends on attracting customers for the Verigene System and building brand loyalty. To successfully perform sales, marketing, distribution and customer support functions ourselves, we will face a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to attract and retain the skilled support team, marketing staff and sales force necessary to commercialize and gain market acceptance for our technology and our products;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our sales and marketing team to identify and penetrate the potential customer base including hospitals, research institutions, and independent diagnostic laboratories;\n\u2022\nthe time and cost of establishing a support team, marketing staff and sales force; and\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of establishing brand recognition and loyalty for our products.\nIn addition, we may seek to enlist one or more third parties to assist with sales, distribution and customer support globally or in certain regions of the world. If we do seek to enter into such arrangements, we may not be successful in attracting desirable sales and distribution partners, or we may not be able to enter into such arrangements on favorable terms. If our sales and marketing efforts, or those of any third-party sales and distribution partners, are not successful, our technologies and products may not gain market acceptance, which would materially impact our business operations.\nWe may be unsuccessful in our long-term goal of expanding our product offerings outside the United States.\nTo the extent we begin to offer our products broadly outside the United States, we expect that we will be dependent on third-party distribution relationships. Distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell our products to the level of our expectations. If distributors do not perform adequately, or we are unable to locate distributors in particular geographic areas, our ability to realize long-term international revenue growth would be materially adversely affected.\nAdditionally, our products may require regulatory clearances and approvals from jurisdictions outside the United States. These products may not be sold in these jurisdictions until the required clearances and approvals are obtained. We are not certain that we will be able to obtain these clearances or approvals on a timely basis, or at all.\nManufacturing risks and inefficiencies may adversely affect our ability to produce products.\nWe must manufacture or engage third parties to manufacture components of our products in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis, while maintaining product quality and acceptable manufacturing costs and complying with regulatory requirements. In determining the required quantities of our products and the manufacturing schedule, we must make significant judgments and estimates based on historical experience, inventory levels, current market trends and other related factors. Because of the inherent nature of estimates, there could be significant differences between our estimates and the actual amounts of products we require. Additionally, some of the components of the Verigene System are custom-made by only a few outside vendors, and we do not have long-term supply contracts for the materials or components supplied by any of our vendors. If we are unable to obtain from one or more of these vendors the needed materials or components that meet our specifications on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we may not be able to meet the demand for our products. We have not arranged for alternate suppliers, and it may be difficult to find alternate suppliers in a timely manner and on terms acceptable to us.\nWe manufacture in one facility, and if there were to be a significant disruption in our ability to use this facility, it would take significant time to setup and validate an alternative manufacturing facility. Disruptions due to lack of power, flooding, fire and environmental controls could adversely impact our ability to manufacture. In addition, we have been steadily increasing manufacturing capacity to meet demand for our products. A disruption of our manufacturing operations resulting from scale-up related challenges such as obtaining sufficient raw materials, hiring of qualified factory personnel, installation and efficient operation of new equipment, and management of our quality controls could cause us to cease, delay, or limit our manufacturing operations and consequently adversely impact our business, our results of operations and our financial condition.\nWe may experience unforeseen technical complications in the processes we use to develop, manufacture, customize or receive orders for our products. These complications could materially delay or limit the use of products we\nattempt to commercialize, substantially increase the anticipated cost of our products or prevent us from implementing our processes at appropriate quality and scale levels, thereby causing our business to suffer. In addition, our manufacturing operations use highly technical processes involving unique, proprietary techniques that our manufacturing personnel must continuously monitor and update, especially as we develop more products. In order to be profitable, we must manufacture greater quantities of products than we have to date, and we must do this more efficiently than we have in the past. We may not be able to do so.\nWe will need to develop manufacturing capacity by ourselves, or with third parties.\nWe will need to either continue to build internal manufacturing capacity or contract with one or more manufacturing partners, or both. We currently use a combination of internal and outsourced manufacturing activities. We may encounter difficulties in manufacturing our products, and due to the complexity of our technology and our manufacturing process, we cannot be sure we fully understand all of the factors that affect our manufacturing processes or product performance. We may not be able to build manufacturing capacity internally or find one or more suitable manufacturing partners, or both, to meet the volume and quality requirements necessary to be successful in the market. If our products do not consistently meet our customers\u2019 performance expectations, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to become profitable. Significant additional resources, implementation of additional manufacturing equipment and changes in our manufacturing processes and organization may be required for the scale-up of each new product prior to commercialization or to meet increasing customer demand once commercialization begins, and this work may not be successfully or efficiently completed. Any delay in establishing or inability to expand our manufacturing capacity could delay our ability to develop or sell our products, which would result in lost revenue and seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and future operating results may be adversely affected by events outside of our control.\nWe develop and manufacture the Verigene System instruments and assays in our facility located in Northbrook, Illinois. This facility and the manufacturing equipment we use would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace. Our business and operating results may be harmed due to interruption of our manufacturing by events outside of our control, including earthquakes, tornadoes and fires. Other possible disruptions may include power loss and telecommunications failures. In the event of a disruption, we may lose customers and we may be unable to regain those customers thereafter. Our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe face intense competition from established and new companies in the molecular diagnostics field.\nWe compete with companies that design, manufacture and market already existing and new molecular diagnostics systems, and single target or low count multiplexing systems and assays are abundant. We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market with new technologies and our competitors improve their current products. One or more of our competitors may offer technology superior to ours and render our technology obsolete or uneconomical. If a competitor were able to deliver a testing application that offers simplicity and ease of use, high count multiplexing and high throughput and fast turnaround, our ability to successfully market our products would be materially adversely affected. Most of our current competitors, as well as many of our potential competitors, have greater name recognition, more substantial intellectual property portfolios, longer operating histories, significantly greater resources to invest in new technologies and more substantial experience in new product development, regulatory expertise, manufacturing capabilities and the distribution channels to deliver products to customers. If we are not able to compete successfully, we may not generate sufficient revenue to become profitable.\nOur success may depend upon how we and our competitors anticipate and adapt to market conditions.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, changes in customer needs, emerging competition and new product introductions. The success of our products will depend on our ability to continue to increase their performance and decrease their price. New technologies, techniques or products could emerge with similar or better price-performance than our system and could exert pricing pressures on our products. It is critical to our success for us to anticipate changes in technology and customer requirements and to successfully introduce enhanced and competitive technology to meet our customers\u2019 and prospective customers\u2019 needs on a timely basis. We may not be able to maintain our technological advantages over emerging technologies in the future and we will need to respond to technological innovation in a rapidly changing industry. If we fail to keep pace with emerging technologies our system will become uncompetitive, our market share will decline and our business, revenue, financial condition and operating results could suffer materially.\nWe may not be able to manage our anticipated growth, and we may experience constraints or inefficiencies caused by unanticipated acceleration and deceleration of customer demand.\nDemand for our respiratory products is directly proportionate to the size and duration of influenza and other respiratory illnesses. Unanticipated acceleration and deceleration of customer demand for our products may result in constraints or inefficiencies related to our manufacturing, sales force, implementation resources and administrative infrastructure. Such constraints or inefficiencies may adversely affect us as a result of delays, lost potential product sales or loss of current or potential customers due to their dissatisfaction. Similarly, over-expansion or investments in anticipation of growth that does not materialize, or develops more slowly than we expect, could harm our financial results and result in overcapacity.\nTo manage our anticipated future growth effectively, we must enhance our manufacturing capabilities and operations, information technology infrastructure, and financial and accounting systems and controls. Organizational growth and scale-up of operations could strain our existing managerial, operational, financial and other resources. Our growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of new products or enhancements of existing products. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our revenue could grow more slowly than expected and we may not be able to achieve our research and development and commercialization goals. Our failure to manage our anticipated growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe use hazardous chemicals, biological materials, and infectious diseases in our business. Any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly.\nOur research and development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals, biological materials and infectious diseases. Our operations produce hazardous waste products. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. We may be sued for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials, and our liability may exceed our insurance coverage and our total assets. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials and specified waste products, as well as the discharge of pollutants into the environment and human health and safety matters. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and may impair our research, development and production efforts. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur substantial costs, including civil or criminal fines and penalties, clean-up costs, or capital expenditures for control equipment or operational changes necessary to achieve and maintain compliance. In addition, we cannot predict the impact on our business of new or amended environmental laws or regulations, or any changes in the way existing and future laws and regulations are interpreted and enforced.\nIf we are unable to recruit and retain key executives and scientists, we may be unable to achieve our goals.\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our senior management and key scientific and technical personnel. The loss of the services of any member of our senior management or our scientific or technical staff could divert management\u2019s attention to transition matters and identification of suitable replacements, if any, and have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Each of our executive officers and other key employees could terminate his or her relationship with us at any time. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our employees.\nIn addition, our product development and marketing efforts could be delayed or curtailed if we are unable to attract, train and retain highly skilled employees and scientific advisors, particularly our management team, senior scientists and engineers and sales and marketing personnel. To expand our research, product development and sales efforts we need additional people skilled in areas such as protein science, information services, manufacturing, sales, marketing and technical support. Because of the complex and technical nature of our system and the dynamic market in which we compete, any failure to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially harm our ability to develop and commercialize our technology. We may not be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHealthcare reform and restrictions on reimbursement may adversely affect our profitability.\nIn the United States, healthcare providers that purchase our products and other diagnostic products generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedure. In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and include both government-sponsored healthcare and private insurance. Third-party payors can affect the pricing or the relative attractiveness of our products by regulating the maximum\namount of reimbursement provided by such payors for laboratory testing services. Lower-than-expected or decreases in reimbursement amounts for tests performed using our products may decrease amounts physicians and other practitioners are able to charge patients, which in turn may adversely affect the willingness of physicians and other practitioners to purchase our products at prices we target, or at all. If we were not able to sell our products at target prices, then we will suffer a decrease in expected profitability that would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements, are continuing. These changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective treatments.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers and business partners, including personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate significantly, which could result in substantial losses for investors and subject us to securities class action litigation.\nMarket prices of diagnostics companies have been volatile. Among the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate are the risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and other factors, including:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our quarterly operating results or the operating results of our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nvariance in our financial performance from the expectations of securities analysts;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the rate of quarterly product placements;\n\u2022\nchanges in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of our markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles or changes in interpretations of existing principles, which could affect our financial results;\n\u2022\nfailure of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance or commercial success;\n\u2022\nconditions and trends in the markets we serve;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u2022\nsuccess of competitive products and services;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations or earnings of our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant new products, contracts, acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in legislation or regulatory policies, practices, or actions;\n\u2022\nthe commencement or outcome of litigation involving our company, our general industry or both;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u2022\nactual or expected sales of our common stock by our stockholders; and\n\u2022\nthe trading volume of our common stock.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, the NASDAQ Capital Market and the market for diagnostics companies in particular, may experience a loss of investor confidence. Such loss of investor confidence may result in extreme price and volume fluctuations in our common stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of our business, financial condition or results of operations. These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock and expose us to securities class action litigation. Such litigation, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could further materially harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur stock price has in the past and may in the future not meet the minimum bid price for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Our ability to publicly or privately sell equity securities and the liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected if we are delisted from The NASDAQ Global Market or Capital Market or if we are unable to transfer our listing to another national securities exchange or stock market.\nOn September 19, 2014, we received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The NASDAQ Stock Market (the \u201cStaff\u201d), notifying us that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the closing bid price of our common stock has not been maintained at the minimum required closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share as required for continued listing on The NASDAQ Global Market pursuant to Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) (\u201cMinimum Bid Price Rule\u201d). In accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rules, we have been given 180 calendar days, or until March 18, 2015, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price. If at any time before March 18, 2015 the closing bid price of our common stock is at least $1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, the Staff will provide written notification to us that we comply with the Minimum Bid Price Rule. During this 180 calendar day period, we also may submit a plan to regain compliance to NASDAQ and may request up to an additional 180 calendar days to complete the plan. On October 23, 2014, we transferred the listing of our common stock to the NASDAQ Capital Market. We currently are evaluating various alternative courses of action to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule, however, there can be no assurance that we will regain compliance or maintain the listing of our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market or qualify to transfer the listing of our common stock to another national securities exchange or stock market. Delisting from NASDAQ would adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities, would significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and would negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. Delisting also could have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities.\nThe issuance of additional common stock may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.\nWe have issued equity securities in the past and may continue to issue equity securities to finance our activities in the future. In addition, outstanding options and warrants to purchase our common stock may be exercised and additional options and warrants may be issued, resulting in the issuance of additional shares of common stock. The issuance by us of additional shares of common stock would result in dilution to our stockholders, and even the perception that such an issuance may occur could have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe liquidity of the trading market for our common stock may be affected in part by the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control the opinions of these analysts. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business.\nCertain provisions of our corporate governing documents could make an acquisition of our company more difficult.\nCertain provisions of our organizational documents could discourage potential acquisition proposals, delay or prevent a change in control of us or limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of preferred stock that can be created and issued by our board of directors without prior stockholder approval, commonly referred to as \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, with rights senior to those of our common stock;\n\u2022\nlimit the persons who can call special stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nprovide that a majority vote of our stockholders is required to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements to nominate persons for election to our board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\ndo not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors; and\n\u2022\nprovide for the filling of vacancies on our board of directors by action of a majority of the directors and not by the stockholders.\nThese and other provisions in our organizational documents could allow our board of directors to affect the rights of a stockholder in a number of ways, including making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of the board of directors. Because the board of directors is responsible for approving the appointment of members of the management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt to replace the current management team. These provisions could also limit the price that investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation provide that Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law, will not apply to us. Section 203 generally prohibits an interested stockholder from engaging in certain types of business combinations with a Delaware corporation for three years after becoming an interested stockholder. An \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns 15% or more of the corporation.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our capital stock, and consequently, returns on investments will depend on the appreciation in price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock, and we currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. Therefore, we do not anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, contractual arrangements, restrictions imposed by applicable law, any limitations on payments of dividends present in our current and future debt agreements, and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant. If we do not pay dividends, and therefore, returns on investments in our company will depend on any future appreciation in the market price of our common stock. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.\nWe will continue to incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, which may adversely affect our operating results and failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could cause investors to lose confidence in our operating results and in the accuracy of our financial reports and could have a material adverse effect on our business and on the price of our common stock.\nAs a public company, we are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for our 2014 fiscal year. Management is responsible for implementing controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the SEC is disclosed accurately and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms. While we have implemented the internal controls that we feel are necessary to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, these controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with these policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nFurthermore, as a public company, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including regulations implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the NASDAQ may increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws,\nregulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If, notwithstanding our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards, we fail to comply, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nFailure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage and/or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, on committees of our board of directors, or as executive officers.\nConcentration of ownership among some of our stockholders, including directors and management may limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nAs of December 31, 2014, approximately 14.5% of our common stock including the exercise of all outstanding warrants and exercisable options to purchase our common stock will be beneficially held by our directors, our executive officers, and greater than five percent stockholders and their respective affiliates. Ann Lurie, and certain entities that she owns or controls, including A&B Equity Holdings, LLC, Ann and Bob Trust 1, AOQ Trust, LFT Partnership, the Ann and Robert H. Lurie Investments, Inc., ANDA Partnership, Lurie Lending Company, L.L.C., Anda-Proques, ANDA-ProQuest, L.L.C., and Lurie Investment Fund, L.L.C., own approximately 12.2% of issued and outstanding common stock. Consequently, a small number of our stockholders may be able to substantially influence our management and affairs. If they choose to act together, they would be able to influence most matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation, or sale of all, or substantially all of our assets and any other transaction. The concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change in control of us even if such changes might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders. In addition the significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with controlling stockholders.", "PERMNO": 92445, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "NSPH"}
