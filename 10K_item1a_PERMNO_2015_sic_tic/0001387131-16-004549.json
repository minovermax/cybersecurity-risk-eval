You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Report, before making an investment decision. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. In that case, the trading price of our shares of Common Stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. You should read the section entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d above for a discussion of what types of statements are forward-looking statements, as well as the significance of such statements in the context of this Report.\nRisks Related to our Financial Position\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred recurring net losses, including net losses of approximately $24.5 million and $28.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $113.6 million. We have generated limited revenue and have funded our operations to date primarily from sales of capital stock and debt. We expect to incur substantial additional losses over the next few years primarily related to our research and development and commercialization activities. As a result, we may never achieve or maintain profitability unless we successfully commercialize our CorPath System. If we are unable to make required payments under any of our obligations for any reason, our creditors may take actions to collect their debts, including foreclosing on our intellectual property that collateralizes our obligations. If we continue to incur substantial losses and are unable to secure additional financing, we could be forced to discontinue or curtail our business operations, sell assets at unfavorable prices, refinance existing debt obligations on terms unfavorable to us, or merge, consolidate, or combine with a company with greater financial resources in a transaction that might be unfavorable to us.\nUntil we reach profitability and generate operating cash flows to grow the business, we will need to continue to raise additional funding. We may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs, commercialization efforts and growth strategy.\nWe will need additional funding for establishing and expanding our sales and marketing infrastructure and for future product development and we may be unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe have funded operations primarily through the issuance of capital stock and debt. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $113.6 million. On May 28, 2015, the Company completed a public offering by issuing 12,650,000 shares of its common stock at $3.80 per share in exchange for proceeds of $44.4 million, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering costs. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $42.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. In order to carry out our business and implement our strategy in the future, we anticipate that we will need to obtain additional financing from time to time through additional debt or equity offerings. There can be no assurances, however, that additional funding will be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nShould we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will experience immediate dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Any additional debt or equity financing that we close may contain terms, such as liquidation and other preferences, which are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If additional financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund expansion, successfully promote our brand name, develop or enhance our services, take advantage of business opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements, any of which could seriously harm our business and reduce the value of your investment.\nWe currently owe approximately $8.0 million under a loan agreement and we can give no assurance that we will be able to satisfy our obligations under the loan agreement at the maturity date.\nOn June 11, 2014, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement pursuant to which the lender agreed to make an aggregate of approximately $10 million available to us under two $5 million secured promissory notes (the \u201cSecured Promissory Notes\u201d). The initial note for approximately $5 million was made on June 11, 2014 (the \u201cInitial Note\u201d) and the second note for approximately $5 million was made on December 31, 2014 (the \u201cSecond Note\u201d). The Secured Promissory Notes are repayable over a term of 27 months which began on July 1, 2015. The Initial Note bears interest at a rate equal to the greater of (w) 11.25% or (x) 11.25% plus the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate, less 3.25%. The Second Note bears interest at a rate equal to the greater of (y) 9.95% or (z) 9.95% plus the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate, less 3.25%. The Secured Promissory Notes include additional interest payments of $125 thousand each due no later than October 1, 2017, which is accreted over the term of the loans. There is no assurance that we will have the funds available to meet our principal and interest payment obligations under the Secured Promissory Notes or that we will be able to satisfy covenants or other obligations under the Secured Promissory Notes. Our covenants under the loan arrangement include certain restrictions with respect to subsequent indebtedness, liens, loans and investments, asset sales, and share repurchases and other restricted payments, subject to certain exceptions. The arrangement also includes financial reporting obligations. An event of default under the Loan and Security Agreement includes, but is not limited to, breach of covenants, insolvency, and occurrence of any default under any agreement or obligation of the Company. In addition, the Loan and Security Agreement contains a customary material adverse effect clause which states that in the event of a material adverse effect, an event of default would occur and the lender has the option to accelerate and demand payment of all or any part of the loan. A material adverse effect is defined in the Loan and Security Agreement as a material change in our business, operations, properties, assets or financial condition or a material impairment of our ability to perform all obligations under this Loan and Security Agreement.\nChanges in our effective tax rate may harm our results of operations.\nA number of factors may harm our future effective tax rates including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\n\u25cf the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various taxing authorities;\n\u25cf change in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u25cf increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes;\n\u25cf changes in available tax credits and deductions;\n\u25cf changes in share-based compensation; and\n\u25cf changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause we have incurred losses to date, we have not recorded any income tax provision thus far. At December 31, 2015, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $83.0 million and $56.6 million, respectively, that can be carried forward and offset against future taxable income. These net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2028. Utilization of net operating losses may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the \u201cchange in ownership\u201d provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. This limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization. We have not yet determined whether any changes in ownership have triggered any such limitations. There can be no assurance that we will utilize the entire amount of our net operating loss carryforwards.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe are completely dependent on the success of our CorPath System, which has a limited commercial history. If our CorPath System fails to gain or loses market acceptance, our business will suffer.\nWe commercially introduced our CorPath System in July 2012, and expect that sales of our CorPath System will account for the majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future. Because of its recent commercial introduction, the CorPath System has limited product and brand recognition. Demand for the CorPath System has not increased as quickly as we expected and we do not know if we will be successful over the long term in generating increased demand for the use of our products. Failure of our CorPath System to significantly penetrate current or new markets would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a competitive industry and if our competitors have products that are marketed more effectively or develop products, treatments or procedures that are similar, more advanced, safer or more effective than ours, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated and our business will be harmed.\nOur potential competitors may develop products, treatments or procedures that are similar, more advanced, safer or more effective than ours. The medical device industry is very competitive and subject to significant technological and practice changes. We expect to face competition from many different sources with respect to our existing products and products that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future.\nCompeting against large established competitors with significant resources may make establishing a market for any products that we develop difficult which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Our commercial opportunity could also be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products, treatments or procedures that are safer, more effective, are more convenient or are less expensive than our existing products or any product that we may develop. Many of our potential competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we may have. Mergers and acquisitions in the medical device industry market may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our potential competitors. Smaller and other early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These companies compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\nIf institutions or physicians are unable to obtain coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures using our products, or if reimbursement is insufficient to cover the costs of purchasing our products, we may be unable to generate sufficient sales to support our business.\nIn the U.S., hospitals generally bill for the services performed with our products to various third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs and private insurance plans. Currently, there is no incremental reimbursement provided for robotic-assisted PCI. Therefore, using the CorPath System and consumable cassette without an incremental reimbursement will initially increase the up-front cost of the PCI procedure and the cath lab operation based on the cost of the CorPath System and also consumable cassettes. This lack of incremental reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures performed with our products, or lack of coverage by governmental and private payors\u2019 policies of interventional procedures performed using our products, could deter hospitals from purchasing our products and may make us unable to generate the revenues necessary to support our business.\nThe commercial success of our products will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by hospitals and physicians. Should we not achieve market acceptance, we will not be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our business.\nThe CorPath System is a new technology that represents a fundamentally new way of performing PCI procedures, however, it competes with established treatment options for PCI procedures. Achieving physician, patient and third-party payor acceptance of the CorPath System as a preferred method of performing vascular procedures will be crucial to our success. If our products fail to achieve market acceptance, hospital customers will not purchase our products and we will not be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our business. We believe that acceptance by hospitals, physicians and third-party payors regarding the benefits of procedures performed using our products will be essential for acceptance of our products by patients. Physicians will not recommend the use of our products unless we can demonstrate that they produce results comparable or superior to existing PCI techniques. Even though we have proven the effectiveness of our products through clinical trials, physicians may elect not to use our products for any number of other reasons. For example, cardiologists may continue to recommend conventional PCI techniques simply because it is already widely accepted. In addition, physicians may be slow to adopt our products because of the perceived liability risks arising from the use of new products and the uncertainty of reimbursement from third-party payors, particularly in light of ongoing health care reform initiatives. We expect that there will be a learning process involved for physicians and their surgical teams to become proficient in the use of our products. Market acceptance could be delayed by the time required to complete this training. We may not be able to rapidly train physicians and their surgical teams in numbers sufficient to generate adequate demand for our products.\nDevelopment and awareness of our brand will largely depend upon our success in increasing our customer base. In order to attract and retain customers and to promote and maintain our brand in response to competitive pressures, management plans to significantly increase our sales and marketing budgets, particularly for our field sales force. If we are unable to economically promote or maintain our brand, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be severely harmed.\nThe successful use of our CorPath System depends in part on physician skill and experience. If we are unable to train physicians on the proper use of our system, we may experience a high risk of product liability.\nThe successful use of our CorPath System depends in part on the physician\u2019s skill and experience. We train users on the proper techniques in using our system to achieve the intended outcome. Because of the acute nature of PCI procedure, we are unable to have a company representative attend cases using the CorPath System. As the number of users of our system increases, it is possible that the level of training that we are accustomed to providing will be insufficient and some physicians may not be willing to invest the time required to become properly trained with our procedure. We may find that physicians who are less skilled in the use of interventional devices will increasingly use the CorPath System, potentially leading to a higher rate of device failure, injury, negative publicity and an increased risk of product liability. We may be subject to claims against us even if the apparent injury is due to the actions of others. Any litigation that may occur based on physician error in the use of our products and our potential inability to train physicians to use our CorPath System may lead to inadequate demand for our products and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future success is dependent upon expanding our technology platform to other segments. Our potential inability to expand our technology platform beyond PCI may adversely affect our ability to increase our revenues.\nCurrently, our only users are interventional cardiologists in PCI procedures. We are dependent on our ability to expand our technology platform and sell our products to other vascular markets in the future, including peripheral, vascular, neurointerventional and other more complex cardiac interventions such as structural heart. The techniques used in our procedure are similar to those used by not only our current user base of interventional cardiologists, but also to those used by other specialists who are generally trained in interventional techniques. Our revenue growth will depend on our ability to obtain approval to sell our CorPath System into these other markets and to sell our products to their physicians and their affiliated hospitals. Convincing physicians to dedicate the time and energy necessary for adequate training in the use of our system is challenging, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in these efforts, if we receive approval. In addition, we do not have significant experience in selling our products to other specialists. They may require, among other things, additional clinical evidence supporting patient and physician benefits, training in a manner to which we are not accustomed or other resources that we do not readily have available or are not cost effective for us to provide. If we are unable to expand into other markets, growth of our sales will be limited and our revenue will be adversely impacted.\nDecreasing cath lab patient volume could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur current target market consists of the estimated 3,250 cath lab rooms in the U.S. that perform PCI procedures, which we estimate represents 40% of the global market of more than 8,000 PCI cath lab rooms. U.S. cath lab patient volume has decreased over the past several years, leading to increased competition for patients. If U.S. cath lab patient volume continues to decrease, it may become more difficult for us to grow revenue and increase market share and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, revenue from the sale of our consumable cassettes to cath labs which already have a CorPath System installed is dependent on how often the systems are utilized. If the utilization rate decreases, our revenues, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nOur products face the risk of technological obsolescence, which, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological change. There can be no assurance that third parties will not succeed in developing or marketing technologies and products that are more effective than ours or that would render our technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive. Additionally, new, less invasive surgical procedures and medications could be developed that replace or reduce the importance of current procedures that use or could use our products. Accordingly, our success will depend in part upon our ability to respond quickly to medical and technological changes through the development of new products. Product development involves a high degree of risk, and we cannot assure you that our new product development efforts will result in any commercially successful products.\nWe may experience long and variable capital sales cycles and/or seasonality in our business which may cause fluctuations in our financial results.\nOur CorPath System may have a lengthy sales and purchase order cycle because it is a major capital item and such a purchase generally requires the approval of senior management of hospitals, their parent organizations, purchasing groups, and/or government bodies, as applicable. In addition, hospitals may delay or accelerate system purchases in conjunction with timing of their capital budget timelines. As a result, it is difficult for us to predict the length of capital sales cycles and, therefore, the exact timing of capital sales. We believe that our sales may tend to be heaviest during the third month of each fiscal quarter, and lighter in the third and first fiscal quarters and heavier in the fourth fiscal quarter. Timing of PCI procedures and changes in the PCI procedure market could directly affect the timing of the purchase of our products by hospitals.\nThe above factors may contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and it is possible that in some future quarters our operating results will fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If that happens, the market price of our stock would likely decrease. These fluctuations, among other factors, also mean that you will not be able to rely upon our operating results in any particular period as an indication of future performance. In addition, the introduction of new products could adversely impact our sales cycle as customers take additional time to assess the benefits and costs of such products.\nIf defects are discovered in our products, we may incur additional unforeseen costs, hospitals may not purchase our products and our reputation may suffer.\nOur products incorporate mechanical parts, electrical components, optical components and computer software, any of which can contain errors or failures, especially when first introduced. In addition, new products or enhancements may contain undetected errors or performance problems that, despite testing, are discovered only after commercial shipment. Because our products are designed to be used to perform complex medical procedures, we expect that our customers will have an increased sensitivity to such defects. We cannot provide any assurances that our products will not experience component aging, errors or performance problems in the future. If we experience flaws or performance problems, any of the following could occur:\n\u25cf delays in product shipments;\n\u25cf loss of revenue;\n\u25cf delay in market acceptance;\n\u25cf diversion of our resources;\n\u25cf damage to our reputation;\n\u25cf product recalls;\n\u25cf regulatory actions;\n\u25cf increased service or warranty costs; or\n\u25cf product liability claims.\nIn the future, we may be subject to product liability and negligence claims relating to the use of our products that could be expensive, divert management\u2019s attention and harm our business.\nOur business exposes us to significant risks of product liability claims, which are inherent to the medical device industry, including product liability exposure related to the testing of our CorPath System in human clinical trials. Because our CorPath System is designed to be used in complex surgical procedures, defects could result in a number of complications, including serious personal injury or death. Claims could be brought against us if use or misuse of our CorPath System causes, or merely appears to have caused, personal injury or death. Product liability claims may be brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class.\nWhile we have and intend to maintain product liability insurance, our coverage may not be sufficient to cover claims that may be made against us and we may be unable to maintain such insurance. Additionally, we have entered into various agreements where we indemnify third parties for certain claims relating to our products. These indemnification obligations may require us to pay significant sums of money for claims that are covered by these indemnification obligations. We are not currently subject to any product liability claims; however, future product liability claims against us, regardless of their merit, may result in negative publicity about us that could ultimately harm our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations.\nWe may be subject to product recalls that could negatively affect our business.\nWe may be subject to product recalls, withdrawals or seizures if any of our products are believed to cause injury or are subject to serious malfunctions or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations in the manufacture, labeling, promotion, sale or distribution of our products. A recall, withdrawal or seizure of any of our products could materially and adversely affect consumer confidence in our brand and lead to decreased demand for our products. In addition, a recall, withdrawal or seizure of our products would require significant management attention, would likely result in substantial and unexpected expenditures and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business may be affected by unfavorable publicity or lack of consumer acceptance.\nWe are highly dependent upon consumer acceptance of the safety, efficacy and quality of our products. Consumer acceptance of a product can be significantly influenced by scientific research or findings, national media attention and other publicity about product use. A product may be received favorably resulting in high sales associated with that product that may not be sustainable as consumer preferences change. Future scientific research or publicity could be unfavorable to our industry or to any of our products and may not be consistent with earlier favorable research or publicity. A future research report or publicity that is perceived by our consumers as less than favorable or that may question earlier favorable research or publicity could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue. Adverse publicity in the form of published scientific research, statements by regulatory authorities or otherwise, whether or not accurate, that associates the use of our product with adverse effects, or that questions the benefits of our product or a similar product, or that claims that our products are ineffective, could reduce market acceptance of our products and could result in decreased product demand and could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe could be subject to significant, uninsured liabilities.\nIn the future, we may not continue to maintain certain existing insurance coverage or adequate levels of coverage. Premiums for many types of insurance have increased significantly in recent years, and depending on market conditions and our circumstances, in the future, certain types of insurance such as directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance or products liability insurance may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe may encounter manufacturing problems or delays that could result in lost revenue.\nManufacturing our products is a complex process. We may encounter difficulties in scaling up or maintaining production of our products, including:\n\u25cf problems involving production yields;\n\u25cf quality control and assurance;\n\u25cf component supply shortages;\n\u25cf import or export restrictions on components, materials or technology;\n\u25cf shortages of qualified personnel; and\n\u25cf compliance with state and federal regulations.\nIf demand for our products exceeds our manufacturing capacity, we could develop a substantial backlog of customer orders. If we are unable to maintain larger-scale manufacturing capabilities, our ability to generate revenues will be limited and our reputation in the marketplace could be damaged.\nWe depend on limited or single source suppliers and vendors for components and services used in the manufacture of our products, and the partial or complete loss of these suppliers or vendors could cause customer supply or production delays and a substantial loss of revenues.\nWe depend on limited or single source suppliers for certain key components, and limited vendors for certain services, used to manufacture our products, making us susceptible to quality issues, shortages and price changes. Any of these limited or single source suppliers or vendors could stop producing or supplying our components or stop performing services used to manufacture our products, cease operations or be acquired by, or enter into exclusive arrangements with, one or more potential competitors. As a result, these suppliers and vendors could stop providing components or services to us at commercially reasonable prices, or at all. Because there are a limited number of suppliers and vendors that manufacture the components and provide the services used to manufacture our products, it may be difficult to quickly identify alternate suppliers or vendors or to qualify alternative components or services on commercially reasonable terms, and our ability to satisfy customer demand may be adversely affected, which could result a substantial loss of revenue.\nDisruption of critical information systems or material breaches in the security of our systems could harm our business customer relations and financial condition.\nInformation technology helps us operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency and accurately produce our financial statements. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach. If our data management systems do not effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business, whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies or human error, our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, perhaps materially. Any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results.\nOur business requires us to use and store personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d) of our customers, employees and business partners. This may include names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers and payment account information. We require user names and passwords in order to access our information technology systems. We also use encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data. These security measures may be compromised as a result of third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularity, and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to our data or accounts. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems.\nWe devote significant resources to network security, data encryption and other security measures to protect our systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. We may experience a breach of our systems and may be unable to protect sensitive data. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in unexpected interruptions, delays, cessation of service and may harm our business operations. Moreover, if a computer security breach affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of PII, our reputation and brand could be materially damaged and use of our products and services could decrease.\nFailure to manage growth effectively could prevent us from achieving our goals.\nOur growth strategy may impose a significant burden on our administrative and operational resources. Our ability to effectively manage growth depends on our ability to substantially expand the capabilities of our administrative and operational resources and to attract, train, manage and retain qualified management and other personnel. Our failure to successfully manage growth could result in our sales not increasing commensurately with capital investments. Our inability to successfully manage growth could materially adversely affect our business.\nAny failure to adequately expand our direct sales force will impede our growth. If we are unable to attract, hire and retain qualified sales and management personnel, the commercial opportunity for our products may be diminished.\nWe expect to be substantially dependent on a direct sales force to attract new business and to manage customer relationships. We plan to expand our direct sales force and believe that there is significant competition for qualified, productive direct sales personnel with advanced sales skills and technical knowledge of our industry. Our ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient direct sales personnel. Recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as expected and we may be unable to hire sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we do business. If we are unable to hire and develop sufficient numbers of productive sales personnel, our business prospects could suffer.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our sales force consisted of 8 and 9 regional sales managers and clinical account managers, respectively. We may not be able to attract, hire, train and retain qualified sales and sales management personnel. If we are not successful in our efforts to maintain and grow a qualified sales force, our ability to independently market and promote our products may be impaired. Even if we are able to effectively maintain a qualified sales force, our sales force may not be successful in commercializing our products.\nTo successfully market and sell our CorPath System internationally, we must address many issues with which we have little or no experience.\nTo date, we have primarily marketed our CorPath system domestically in the United States. Over the long term, we intend to grow our business internationally, and to do so we will need to attract distributors or expand our sales operations to effectively sell our CorPath System internationally. Distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell our CorPath System in accordance with our expectations. If future distributors do not perform adequately, or we are unable to locate distributors for particular geographic areas, we may not realize expected long term international revenue growth. International sales are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf varying coverage and reimbursement processes and procedures;\n\u25cf difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u25cf export restrictions, trade regulations and foreign tax laws;\n\u25cf fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf foreign certification and regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf lengthy payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u25cf customs clearance and shipping delays;\n\u25cf political and economic instability; and\n\u25cf preference for locally produced products.\nIf one or more of these risks is realized, it could require us to dedicate significant resources to remedy the situation, our plan to expand internationally may fail and our financial performance may suffer as a result.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key personnel, or to retain our executive management team, we may be unable to successfully develop or commercialize our products.\nOur success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified managerial personnel. We are highly dependent upon our executive management team. The loss of the services of any one or more of the members of our executive management team could delay or prevent the successful completion of some of our development and commercialization objectives.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified sales and marketing personnel is critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may also be employed by other companies and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain protection for intellectual property relating to our technology and products, the value of our technology and products will be adversely affected.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain protection for the intellectual property covering or incorporated into our technology and products. The patent situation in the field of medical devices involves complex legal and scientific questions. We rely upon patents, trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our technology and products. We may not be able to obtain patent rights relating to our technology or products and pending patent applications to which we have rights may not issue as patents or if issued, may not issue in a form that will be advantageous to us. Even if issued, any patents issued to us may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated, held to be unenforceable or circumvented. Changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nTrademark protection of our products may not provide us with a meaningful competitive advantage.\nWe use trademarks on our products and believe that having distinctive marks is an important factor in marketing them. Distinctive marks may also be important for any additional products that we successfully develop and commercially market. If we initiate legal proceedings to seek to protect our trademarks, the costs of these proceedings could be substantial and it is possible that our efforts could be unsuccessful.\nWe may in the future be a party to patent litigation and administrative proceedings that could be costly and could interfere with our ability to sell our CorPath System.\nLitigation related to infringement and other intellectual property claims, with or without merit, is unpredictable, can be expensive and time consuming and can divert management\u2019s attention from our core business. If we lose this kind of litigation, a court could require us to pay substantial damages, and prohibit us from using technologies essential to our CoParth System, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If relevant patents are upheld as valid and enforceable and we are found to infringe, we could be prevented from selling our CorPath System unless we can obtain a license to use technology or ideas covered by such patents or are able to redesign our CorPath System to avoid infringement. We do not know whether any necessary licenses would be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all, or whether we could redesign our CorPath System or processes to avoid infringement.\nCompeting products may also appear in other countries in which our patent coverage might not exist or be as strong. If we lose a foreign patent lawsuit, we could be prevented from marketing our CorPath System in one or more foreign countries.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nRecently enacted healthcare legislation reforming the U.S. healthcare system, as well as future reforms, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, \u201cthe PPACA\u201d), was signed into law which makes changes that are expected to significantly impact healthcare providers, insurers, pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers. One of the principal aims of the PPACA as currently enacted is to expand health insurance coverage to approximately 32,000,000 uninsured Americans. The consequences of these significant coverage expansions on the sales of our products are unknown and speculative at this point.\nThe PPACA contains a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions, among other things. This includes new fees or taxes on certain health-related industries, including medical device manufacturers, regardless of whether the companies are profitable. Beginning in 2013, medical device manufacturers were required to pay an excise tax (or sales tax) of 2.3% of certain U.S. medical device revenues. Under this provision, we have paid an excise tax of approximately $0.1 million through December 31, 2015, which tax is reflected in our operating expenses. Though there are some exceptions to the excise tax, this excise tax applies to all or most of our products sold within the U.S. At the present time the excise tax is suspended due to the operation of a provision in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, signed into law on December 18, 2015 but that two-year suspension period ends on December 31, 2017. However, there is no guarantee that the excise tax will continue to be suspended by congressional action after this two-year moratorium ends, so we would expect to become subject to the 2.3% medical device tax again beginning on January 1, 2018. The PPACA also establishes a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee and identify priorities in comparative clinical effectiveness research in an effort to coordinate and develop such research; implements payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians, and other providers to improve the coordination, quality, and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models; and creates an independent payment advisory board that will submit recommendations to reduce Medicare spending if projected Medicare spending exceeds a specified growth rate.\nThe PPACA provisions on comparative clinical effectiveness research also extend the initiatives of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, known as the stimulus package, which included $1.1 billion in funding to study the comparative effectiveness of health care treatments and strategies. This stimulus funding was designated for, among other things, conducting, supporting or reviewing research that compares and evaluates the risks and benefits, clinical outcomes, effectiveness and appropriateness of products. The PPACA appropriates additional funding to comparative clinical effectiveness research. Although Congress has indicated that this funding is intended to improve the quality of health care, it remains unclear how the research will impact current Medicare coverage and reimbursement or how new information will influence other third-party payor policies. The taxes imposed by the PPACA and the expansion in the government\u2019s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may result in decreased profits to us, lower reimbursement by payors using our products, and/or reduced medical procedure volumes, all of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which, among other things, creates the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.\nWe expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and our ability to successfully commercialize our products or could limit or eliminate our spending on certain development projects.\nThe U. S. government has in the past considered, is currently considering and may in the future consider healthcare policies and proposals intended to curb rising healthcare costs, including those that could significantly affect both private and public reimbursement for healthcare services. State and local governments, as well as a number of foreign governments, are also considering or have adopted similar types of policies. Future significant changes in the healthcare systems in the United States or elsewhere, and current uncertainty about whether and how changes may be implemented, could have a negative impact on the demand for our products. We are unable to predict whether other healthcare policies, including policies stemming from legislation or regulations affecting our business, may be proposed or enacted in the future; what effect such policies would have on our business; or the effect ongoing uncertainty about these matters will have on the purchasing decisions of our customers.\nWe are subject to federal and state laws governing our business practices which, if violated, could result in substantial penalties. Additionally, challenges to or investigations of our practices could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to and could otherwise harm our business.\nThe Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback laws, and several similar state laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, prohibit payments or other remuneration that could be considered to induce hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers of our products either to refer patients or to purchase, lease or order, or arrange for or recommend the purchase, lease or order of healthcare products or services for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Further, the recently enacted PPACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal health care fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the PPACA provides that the government or a whistleblower may assert that a claim (including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute) constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements we may have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers of our products. They particularly impact how we structure our sales offerings, including discount practices, customer support, education and training programs, physician consulting and other service arrangements. These laws are broadly written, and it is often difficult to determine precisely how these laws will be applied to specific circumstances. Violating anti-kickback laws can result in civil and criminal penalties, which can be substantial and include exclusion from government healthcare programs for noncompliance. Even an unsuccessful challenge or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity, and be costly to defend, and thus could harm our business and results of operations.\nThe PPACA also imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to physicians and other healthcare providers. Such information must be made publicly available in a searchable format. In addition, device manufacturers will also be required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of approximately $0.2 million per year (and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for \u201cknowing failures\u201d), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. Device manufacturers were required to begin collecting data on August 1, 2013 and were required to submit reports to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) by March 31, 2014 and the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. We submitted our report due March 31, 2014 in a timely manner and believe that we are in compliance with this reporting requirement.\nIn addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians, including the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. Certain states mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs to ensure compliance with these laws, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. The shifting commercial compliance environment, and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements, increases the possibility that a healthcare company may be found out of compliance of one or more of the requirements, subjecting us to significant civil monetary penalties.\nCompliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our potential international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and could expose us or our employees to fines and penalties in the U.S. and/or abroad. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar laws in foreign countries, such as the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Although we intend to implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires us to track and disclose the source of certain metals used in manufacturing which may stem from minerals (so-called \u201cconflict minerals\u201d) which originate in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining regions. These metals include tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten. In most cases no acceptable alternative material exists which has the necessary properties. It is not possible to determine the source of the metals by analysis but instead a good faith description of the source of the intermediate components and raw materials must be obtained. The components which incorporate those metals may originate from many sources and we may purchase fabricated products from manufacturers who may have a long and difficult-to-trace supply chain. As the spot price of these materials varies, producers of the metal intermediates can be expected to change the mix of sources used, and components and assemblies which we buy may have a mix of sources as their origin. We do not believe these materials are present in the component parts that we use in our CorPath System, but there can be no assurance that these metals will not be included in our components and assemblies from time to time.\nOur products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain domestic regulatory review process. If we do not obtain and maintain the necessary domestic regulatory authorizations, we will not be able to provide our products in the U.S.\nOur products and operations are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development, bench and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, promotion, marketing, sales, distribution and post-market support and reporting of medical devices in the U.S. to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In order for us to market our Class II products for use in the U.S., we must first obtain clearance from the FDA pursuant to Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFFDCA\u201d). Clearance under Section 510(k) requires demonstration that a new device is substantially equivalent to another device with 510(k) clearance or grandfathered (\u201cpre-amendment\u201d) status or to a device that was reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I (those are referred to as predicate devices). If we significantly modify our products after they receive FDA clearance, or seek to market them for additional indications for use, the FDA may require us to submit a separate 510(k) or premarket approval application (\u201cPMA\u201d) for the modified product before we are permitted to market the products in the U.S. In addition, if we develop products in the future that are not considered to be substantially equivalent to a predicate device, we will be required to obtain FDA approval by submitting a PMA. The FDA may not act favorably or quickly in its review of our 510(k) or PMA submissions or we may encounter significant difficulties and costs in our efforts to obtain FDA clearance or approval, any of which could delay or preclude our sale of new products in the U.S. Furthermore, the FDA may request additional data or require us to conduct further testing, or compile more data, including clinical data and clinical studies, in support of a 510(k) submission.\nRegulatory policy affecting our products can change at any time. The changes and their impact on our business cannot be accurately predicted. For example, in 2011, the FDA announced a Plan of Action to modernize and improve the FDA\u2019s premarket review of medical devices, and has implemented, and continues to implement, reforms intended to streamline the premarket review process. In addition, as part of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, Congress enacted several reforms through the Medical Device Regulatory Improvements and additional miscellaneous provisions which will further affect both pre- and post-approval medical device regulation. Most recently, FDA has been focusing on the cybersecurity risks associated with certain medical devices and encouraging device manufacturers to take a more proactive approach to assessing the cybersecurity risks of their devices both during development and on a periodic basis after the devices are in commercial distribution. These regulatory efforts could lead to new FDA requirements in the future or additional product liability or other litigation risks if one of our products is considered to be susceptible to third-party tampering. Changes in the FDA 510(k) process could make clearance more difficult to obtain, increase delay, add uncertainty and have other significant adverse effects on our ability to obtain and maintain clearance for our products. The FDA may also, instead of accepting a 510(k) submission, require us to submit a PMA, which is typically a much more complex, lengthy and burdensome application than a 510(k) submission. To support a PMA, the FDA would likely require that we conduct one or more clinical studies to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective. In some cases such studies may be requested for a 510(k) as well. We may not be able to meet the requirements to obtain 510(k) clearance or PMA approval, in which case the FDA may not grant any necessary clearances or approvals. In addition, the FDA may place significant limitations upon the intended uses of our products as a condition to a 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. Product applications can also be denied or withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory requirements or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following clearance or approval. Any delays or failure to obtain FDA clearance or approval of new products we develop, any limitations imposed by the FDA on new product use or the costs of obtaining FDA clearance or approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn order to conduct a clinical investigation involving human subjects for the purpose of demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of a medical device, a company must, among other things, apply for and obtain Institutional Review Board (\u2018IRB\u201d) approval of the proposed investigation. In addition, if the clinical study involves a \u201csignificant risk\u201d (as defined by the FDA) to human health, the sponsor of the investigation must also submit and obtain FDA approval of an Investigational Device Exemption (\u201cIDE\u201d) application. Our system product is considered a significant risk device requiring IDE approval prior to investigational use. We may not be able to obtain FDA and/or IRB approval to undertake clinical trials in the U.S. for any new devices we intend to market in the U.S. in the future. If we do obtain such approvals, we may not be able to conduct studies which comply with the IDE and other regulations governing clinical investigations or the data from any such trials may not support clearance or approval of the investigational device. Failure to obtain such approvals or to comply with such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Certainty that clinical trials will meet desired endpoints, produce meaningful or useful data and be free of unexpected adverse effects, or that the FDA will accept the validity of foreign clinical study data cannot be assured, and such uncertainty could preclude or delay market clearance or authorizations resulting in significant financial costs and reduced revenue.\nIf we fail to obtain regulatory clearances in other countries for existing products or products under development, we will not be able to commercialize these products in those countries.\nIn order for us to market our products in other countries, we must comply with extensive safety and quality regulations in other countries regarding the quality, safety and efficacy of our products. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals, clearance or grant of Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne (\u201cCE\u201d) Certificates of Conformity and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Failure to obtain regulatory approval, clearance or CE Certificates of Conformity (or equivalent) in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products may harm our ability to generate revenue and harm our business. Approval and CE marking procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval or CE Certificate of Conformity in other countries might differ from that required to obtain FDA clearance. The regulatory approval or CE marking process in other countries may include all of the risks detailed above regarding FDA clearance in the United States. Regulatory approval or the CE marking of a product in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval or a CE Certificate of Conformity in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. Failure to obtain regulatory approval or a CE Certificate of Conformity in other countries or any delay or setback in obtaining such approval could have the same adverse effects described above regarding FDA clearance in the United States.\nThe primary regulatory environment in Europe is that of the European Economic Area (the \u201cEEA\u201d), which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. In the European Economic Area (EEA\u201d), our devices are required to comply with the Essential Requirements laid down in Annex I to the Medical Devices Directive (applicable in the non-EU EEA Member States via the Agreement on the EEA). We are also required to ensure compliance with the relevant quality system requirements laid down in the Annexes to the Medical Devices Directive. Companies compliant with ISO requirements such as \u201cEN ISO 13485: 2003 Medical devices-Quality management systems-Requirements for regulatory purposes\u201d benefit from a presumption of conformity with the relevant Essential Requirements or the quality system requirements laid down in the Annexes to the Medical Devices Directive. Following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the Essential Requirements and quality system requirements, the Notified Body issues a CE Certificate of Conformity. This Certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related CE Declaration of Conformity. We received a CE Certificate of Conformity for our CorPath System in 2011. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in meeting and continuing to meet the requirements of the Medical Devices Directive in the EEA.\nWe may incur liability related to the off-label use or misleading advertising of our products.\nThe FDA regulates the promotional labeling for and the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) regulates the advertising of our products to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances, that there is scientific data to substantiate the claims and that our promotion and advertising is neither false nor misleading. The off-label marketing or false advertising of our products may harm our image in the marketplace, result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business, or result in costly investigations and sanctions from the FDA and other regulatory bodies if we are deemed to have engaged in off-label promotion or false advertising.\nIf we are found to have violated laws protecting the confidentiality of patient health information, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities and harm our reputation or our business.\nThere are a number of federal and state laws in the United States protecting the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient records, and restricting the use and disclosure of that protected information. In particular, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services promulgated patient privacy rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) and the HITECH Act of 2009, which expanded the application of those rules. These privacy rules protect medical records and other personal health information by limiting their use and disclosure, giving individuals the right to access, amend and seek accounting of their own health information and limiting most use and disclosures of health information to the minimum amount reasonably necessary to accomplish the intended purpose of the use or disclosure. If we are found to be in violation of the privacy rules under HIPAA/HITECH (or other applicable federal or state laws), we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities, harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nComplying with FDA regulations is a complex process, and our failure to comply fully could subject us to significant enforcement actions.\nBecause our products are commercially distributed, numerous quality and post-market regulatory requirements apply, including the following:\n\u25cf continued compliance to the FDA Quality System Regulations (\u201cQSR\u201d), which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the development and manufacturing process, as well as to take into account newly emerging risks associated with a medical device such as cybersecurity vulnerabilities;\n\u25cf labeling regulations;\n\u25cf the FDA\u2019s general prohibition against false or misleading statements in the labeling or promotion of products for unapproved uses;\n\u25cf stringent complaint reporting and Medical Device Reporting regulations, which requires that manufacturers keep detailed records of investigations or complaints against their devices and to report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur;\n\u25cf adequate use of the Corrective and Preventive Actions process to identify and correct or prevent significant systemic failures of products or processes or in trends which suggest same; and\n\u25cf the reporting of Corrections and Removals, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA recalls and field corrective actions taken to reduce a risk to health or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may pose a risk to health.\nWe are subject to inspection and marketing surveillance by the FDA to determine our compliance with regulatory requirements. If the FDA finds that we have failed to comply, it can institute a wide variety of regulatory or enforcement actions, ranging from inspectional observations (Form FDA 483) to a public Warning Letter to more severe civil and criminal sanctions including the seizure of our products and equipment or a ban on the import or export of our products. Our failure to comply with applicable requirements could lead to an enforcement action that may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAny modification or change of medical devices cleared for market requires the manufacturer to make a determination whether the change is significant enough to require new 510(k) clearance. We have created labeling, advertising and user training for our CorPath System to describe specific procedures that we believe are fully within the scope of our existing 510(k) indications for use stated in our 510(k) clearances. We cannot assure that the FDA would agree that all such specific procedures are within the scope of the existing general clearance or that we have compiled adequate information to support the safety and efficacy of using the CorPath System for all such specific procedures.\nIf our manufacturing facilities do not continue to meet federal, state or other manufacturing standards, we may be required to temporarily cease all or part of our manufacturing operations, distribution of our products and/or recall our products which would result in significant product delivery delays and lost revenue.\nOur manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities and our operations will continue to be regulated and inspected by the FDA and other regulatory agencies for compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201cCGMP\u201d) requirements contained in the QSR and other regulatory requirements. For any CorPath Systems shipped internationally, we are also required to comply with the International Organization for Standardization (\u201cISO\u201d) quality system standards as well as European Directives and norms in order to produce products for sale in the EU. In addition, many countries such as Canada and Japan have very specific additional regulatory requirements for quality assurance and manufacturing. If we fail to continue to comply with CGMP requirements, as well as ISO or other regulatory standards, we may be required to cease all or part of our operations until we comply with these regulations.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nIf our stock price declines, our common stock may be subject to delisting from the NYSE MKT.\nOur common stock was approved for listing on the NYSE MKT and commenced trading on May 29, 2015 under the symbol \u201cCVRS\u201d. Our common stock is currently trading at a price of less than $2.00 per share. We currently meet the continued listing standards of NYSE MKT. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to comply with the minimum bid price and the other standards that we are required to meet in order to maintain a listing of our common stock on the NYSE MKT. Our failure to continue to meet these requirements may result in our common stock being delisted from the NYSE MKT. If our common stock is delisted, this would, among other things, substantially impair our ability to raise additional funds and could result in a loss of institutional investor interest and fewer development opportunities for us.\nThe price of our common stock could be highly volatile due to a number of factors, which could lead to losses by investors and costly securities litigation.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in our Company will lead to the development of an active trading market on the NYSE MKT or any other exchange that we may trade on in the future. Prior to listing on the NYSE MKT, our common stock traded on the OTCQB in limited volumes. The trading price of our common stock on the OTCQB and the NYSE MKT has been highly volatile and is likely to continue to be highly volatile in response to a number of factors including, without limitation, the following:\n\u25cf fluctuations in price and volume due to investor speculation and other factors that may not be tied to our financial performance;\n\u25cf performance by us in the execution of our business plan;\n\u25cf financial viability;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in our operating results;\n\u25cf announcements of developments by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf market conditions in our industry;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf adoption of new accounting standards affecting our industry;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf introduction of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market;\n\u25cf regulatory developments in both the United States and foreign countries;\n\u25cf performance of products sold and advertised by licensees in the marketplace;\n\u25cf economic and other external factors;\n\u25cf period-to-period fluctuations in financial results; and\n\u25cf other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations. In the past, and several recent situations, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has been initiated against such company. Litigation initiated against us, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to successfully maintain our internal controls over financial reporting or if additional material weaknesses are discovered in our internal accounting procedures, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with the audit of our 2014 consolidated financial statements, our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, noted a material weakness in our controls relating to our accounting for overhead costs which affected inventories and property and equipment. Specifically, our cost accounting and reserve estimate processes lacked adequate levels of monitoring and review controls to identify and correct inventory valuation errors in a timely manner, which was primarily the result of an insufficient number of qualified accounting resources to ensure adequate technical review of inventory accounting issues during the financial statement close process. A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAny failure to develop or maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting or difficulties encountered in maintaining or improving our internal controls over financial reporting could harm our operating results and prevent us from meeting our reporting obligations. Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock could drop significantly. In addition, investors relying upon this misinformation could make an uninformed investment decision, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the Commission or other regulatory authorities or to stockholder class action securities litigation.\nWe cannot assure you that measures taken this past year to remediate the material weakness described above will prevent future material weaknesses in this area. We also cannot assure you that we have identified all of our existing control deficiencies or that we will not in the future have additional material weaknesses.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act and will be able to avail ourselves of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFor so long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various requirements applicable to public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including:\n\u25cf the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, requiring that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u25cf the \u201csay on pay\u201d provisions (requiring a non-binding shareholder vote to approve compensation of certain executive officers) and the \u201csay on golden parachute\u201d provisions (requiring a non-binding shareholder vote to approve golden parachute arrangements for certain executive officers in connection with mergers and certain other business combinations) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act, or Dodd-Frank Act, and some of the disclosure requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act relating to compensation of our chief executive officer;\n\u25cf the requirement to provide detailed compensation discussion and analysis in proxy statements and reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and instead provide a reduced level of disclosure concerning executive compensation; and\n\u25cf any rules that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board may adopt requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report on the financial statements.\nWe may take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d upon the earliest of: (i) the fifth year after the first sale of our securities as a public reporting company on January 18, 2012; (ii) the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues are $1.0 billion or more; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; or (iv) as of the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year.\nWe currently take advantage of some, but not all, of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that will be available to us so long as we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d For example, we have irrevocably elected not to take advantage of the extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards available under Section 102(b) of the JOBS Act. Our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting so long as we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d which may increase the risk that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting go undetected. Likewise, so long as we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we may elect not to provide you with certain information, including certain financial information and certain information regarding compensation of our executive officers, that we would otherwise have been required to provide in filings we make with the SEC, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate our company. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile and may decline.\nOur Board of Directors may issue and fix the terms of shares of our preferred stock without stockholder approval and we are subject to Nevada law, each of which may delay or prevent a change in control of our Company.\nOur Articles of Incorporation, as amended, authorize the issuance of up to 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value per share, with such designation rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue shares of Preferred Stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock. In the event of such issuances, the Preferred Stock could be used, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company.\nThe \u201cbusiness combination\u201d provisions of Sections 78.411 to 78.444, inclusive, of the Nevada Revised Statutes (the \u201cNRS\u201d), generally prohibit a Nevada corporation with at least 200 stockholders of record from engaging in various \u201ccombination\u201d transactions with any interested stockholder for a period of two years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the transaction is approved by the board of directors prior to the date the interested stockholder obtained such status or the combination is approved by the board of directors and thereafter is approved at a meeting of the stockholders by the affirmative vote of stockholders representing at least 60% of the outstanding voting power held by disinterested stockholders, unless (a) the combination was approved by the board of directors prior to the person becoming an interested stockholder or (b) the transaction by which the person first became an interested stockholder was approved by the board of directors before the person became an interested stockholder. After the expiration of two years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, a Nevada corporation subject to the statue may not engage in a combination with an interested stockholder unless either (a) or (b) above are satisfied or the combination is approved after expiration of such two year period by a majority of the voting power held by disinterred stockholder; or the consideration to be paid in the combination is at least equal to the highest of: (i) the highest price per share paid by the interested stockholder within the two years immediately preceding the date of the announcement of the combination or in the transaction in which it became an interested stockholder, whichever is higher, (ii) the market value per share of common stock on the date of announcement of the combination and the date the interested stockholder acquired the shares, whichever is higher or (ii) for holders of preferred stock, the highest liquidation value of the preferred stock, if it is higher. The NRS business combination provisions may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company.\nFuture sales by our stockholders may negatively affect our stock price and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings.\nSales of our common stock in the public market could lower the market price of our common stock. Sales may also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that our management deems acceptable or at all. Of the 118,832,441 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2015, approximately 38,150.684 shares are freely tradable without restriction by stockholders who are not our affiliates. We issued an aggregate of 73,360,287 shares of common stock to the former shareholders of Corindus, Inc. pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, and such shares are \u201crestricted securities\u201d as defined in Rule 144. In addition to being subject to restrictions on transfer imposed under federal securities laws, each holder of the newly issued shares entered into a lock-up agreement, which among other things, restricts the sale or transfer of these shares for specified periods. Under the lock-up agreement, each holder was prohibited from selling or disposing of securities of our Company held thereby until August 12, 2015 (the one year anniversary of the closing of the Acquisition) and after the completion of this 12-month lock-up period, such holders are prohibited from selling or disposing of more than 5.0% of securities of our Company held thereby per each rolling 90-day period (beginning with the holder\u2019s first sale of securities following the initial 12-month lock-up period) over the following 12-month period. Our affiliates hold 63,452,513 shares, all of which shares may be resold in the public market only when released from the provisions of a lock-up agreement, when and if registered pursuant to an exemption from registration, or pursuant to the applicable requirements of Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933. Although we have no current plans to do so, we may waive the restrictions on transfer under these lock-up agreements in the future. When the shares covered under the lock-up agreements become available for resale, sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nInsiders have substantial control over the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control, including a transaction in which the Company\u2019s stockholders could sell or exchange their shares for a premium.\nAs of the filing of this Annual Report, our directors and executive officers beneficially own an aggregate of approximately 39% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, our directors and executive officers, if acting together, may have the ability to affect the outcome of matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors, and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these persons acting together may have the ability to control our management and business affairs. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership may harm the value of our common stock by:\n\u25cf delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control;\n\u25cf impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination; or\n\u25cf discouraging a potential acquirer from making an acquisition proposal or otherwise attempting to obtain control.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends and investors should not buy our common stock expecting to receive dividends.\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends and we do not anticipate that we will declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, you will only realize an economic gain on your investment in our common stock if the price appreciates. You should not purchase our common stock expecting to receive cash dividends. Since we do not pay dividends, and if we are not successful in establishing an orderly trading market for our shares, then you may not have any manner to liquidate or receive any payment on your investment. Therefore our failure to pay dividends may cause you to not see any return on your investment even if we are successful in our business operations. In addition, because we do not pay dividends we may have trouble raising additional funds which could affect our ability to expand our business operations.\nSecurities analysts may not cover our common stock and this may have a negative impact on our common stock\u2019s market price.\nThe future trading market for our common stock may depend on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. We may face additional risks since we became a public company through an acquisition which, for accounting purposes, was treated as a reverse merger. There is no guarantee that securities analysts will cover our common stock and there may be little incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock. If securities analysts do not cover our common stock, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect our common stock\u2019s market price, if any. If we are covered by securities analysts who downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to publish regular reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe are likely to raise additional funds, finance acquisitions or develop strategic relationships by issuing capital stock.\nWe have financed our operations, and we expect to continue to finance our operations, make acquisitions and develop strategic relationships by issuing equity or convertible debt securities which could significantly reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders. Furthermore, any newly issued securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing common stock. Moreover, any issuances by us of equity securities may be at or below the prevailing market price of our common stock and in any event may have a dilutive impact on your ownership interest, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We may also raise additional funds through the incurrence of debt, and the holders of any debt we may issue would have rights superior to your rights in the event we are not successful and are forced to seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws.\nThe lack of substantial public company experience of our management team could adversely impact our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of U.S. securities laws.\nOur management team has limited experience in working with public companies which could impair our ability to comply with legal and regulatory requirements such as those imposed by Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Such responsibilities include complying with federal securities laws and making required disclosures on a timely basis. Our senior management may not be able to implement programs and policies in an effective and timely manner that adequately respond to such increased legal, regulatory compliance and reporting requirements, including the establishing and maintaining internal controls over financial reporting. Any such deficiencies, weaknesses or lack of compliance could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which is necessary to maintain our public company status. If we were to fail to fulfill those obligations, our ability to continue as a public company would be in jeopardy in which event you could lose your entire investment in our Company.\nOur management will be devoting substantial time to comply with regulations and we will incur significant costs as a public company.\nAs a public company, we will be subject to certain rules and regulations. In particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules subsequently implemented by the Commission impose various requirements on public companies with respect to corporate governance practices. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that our management maintain adequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and, as applicable, our independent registered public accounting firm, to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our compliance with the foregoing will require us to expend significant management efforts.\nAdditionally, we will incur significant legal and financial compliance costs associated with our public company reporting requirements, costs associated with applicable corporate governance and accounting requirements, We also expect that these applicable rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.\nWe may become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management\u2019s attention and harm our business.\nThe stock market in general, and the market for medical device companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation often is expensive and diverts management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially harm our financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 15344, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "CVRS"}
