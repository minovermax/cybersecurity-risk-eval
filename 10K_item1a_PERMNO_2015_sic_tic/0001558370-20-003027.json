RISK FACTORS\nThe Company is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and as such, is not required to provide information in response to this item. However, in light of recent events, stockholders should be aware of the following risks associated with an investment in the Company:\nIf Bee Street fails to complete its tender offer for our common stock, our stock price, business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe cannot assure that Bee Street will complete its tender offer for our common stock. If the tender offer is not completed, we will be subject to several risks. Because the current trading price of our common stock may reflect a market assumption that the tender offer will be completed, failure to complete the tender offer could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Also, we have incurred significant, and may incur additional, costs in connection with the tender offer, including the diversion of management resources, for which we will have received little or no benefit if the\ntender offer is not completed. A failed transaction may also result in a negative impression of the Company in the investment community.\nThe tender offer by Bee Street may increase the volatility of the price of our common stock, which may could result in substantial losses by investors.\nThe tender offer by Bee Street could affect the trading price of our common stock and increase its volatility, as well as reduce the market liquidity for our common stock. Securities class action litigation is commonly instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. The commencement of this type of litigation against us in the future could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nThe spread of a new strain of coronavirus (also known as COVID-19) may adversely affect our business operations.\nIn December 2019, a new strain of coronavirus (also known as, and hereinafter referred to as \u201cCOVID-19\u201d) originated in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread to infect many people in the city and surrounding area. In some cases, COVID-19 causes severe illness and even death. Since its discovery, COVID-19 has spread throughout China and to several other countries, significantly impacting their economies. Various measures may be taken by countries, including the United States, both on a macro country-wide level and a local level, to combat the virus and its spread. These may include quarantines or bans on public events.\nThe continued spread of COVID-19 may adversely affect our supply chain, results of operations and business generally, depending on the extent of its spread of the virus, the rate of infection, the severity of illness and the probability of lethality, the relative effect on various portions of the population (such as the aged), the measures taken to combat the virus and their effectiveness, the effect on international trade of any measures taken to combat the virus, any action taken (such as the lowering of interest rates) by government entities to combat the negative macroeconomic effects of these measures, the timing and availability of any vaccine for the virus, and other factors.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stated a risk exists of a pandemic in the United States, which would mean that the current methods in place to control of the spread of the virus have been ineffective. In such a situation, the effect on the economy and on the public may be severe. There are no comparable recent events which may provide guidance as to the effect of the spread of COVID-19 and a potential pandemic, and, as a result, there is considerable uncertainty of its potential effect on our business and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 30840, "SIC": 3585, "TIC": "CUO"}
