{"cik": "80172", "company": "NATIONAL PRESTO INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-11", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s three business segments described above are all subject to a number of risk factors, the occurrence of any one or more of which could have a significant adverse impact on the business, financial condition, or results of operations of the Company as a whole.\n\ufeff\nHousewares/Small Appliance Segment:\n\ufeff\nIncreases in the costs for raw materials, energy, transportation and other necessary supplies could adversely affect the results of the Company\u2019s operations.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s suppliers purchase significant amounts of metals, plastics, and energy to manufacture the Company\u2019s products. Also, the cost of fuel has a major impact on transportation costs as do intermodal shipping rates. Any increased costs that cannot be fully absorbed or passed along in the form of price increases to the retail customer can have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operating results.\n\ufeff\nReliance on third-party suppliers in Asia makes this segment vulnerable to supply interruptions and foreign business risks.\n\ufeff\nThe majority of the housewares/small appliance products are manufactured by a handful of third-party suppliers in Asia, primarily in the People\u2019s Republic of China. The Company\u2019s ability to continue to select and develop relationships with reliable vendors who provide timely deliveries of quality parts and products will impact its success in meeting customer demand. Most products are procured on a \u201cpurchase order\u201d basis. As a result, the Company may be subject to unexpected changes in pricing or supply of products. There is no assurance that it could quickly or effectively replace any of its vendors if the need arose. Any significant failure to obtain products on a timely basis at an affordable cost or any significant delays or interruptions of supply may disrupt customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\n\ufeff\nInternational manufacturing is subject to significant risks, including, among others, labor unrest, adverse social, political and economic conditions, interruptions in international shipments, tariffs and other trade barriers, legal and regulatory constraints and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Although China currently enjoys \u201cmost favored nation\u201d trading status with the United States, the U.S. Government has in the past proposed to revoke that status and to impose higher tariffs on products imported from China, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. Currently, it maintains penalty tariffs on some imports and in the past has threatened to impose a penalty tariff on all products. The latter, if imposed, would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\n\ufeff\nThe Housewares/Small Appliance segment is dependent on key customers, and any significant decline in business from one or more of its key customers could adversely affect the segment\u2019s operating results.\n\ufeff\nAlthough the Company has a long-established relationship with its major customers, it does not have any long-term supply agreements or guaranties of minimum purchases. As a result, the customers may fail to place anticipated orders, change planned quantities, delay purchases, or change product assortments for reasons beyond the Company\u2019s control, which could prove detrimental to the segment\u2019s operating results.\n\ufeff\nThe sales for this segment are highly seasonal and dependent upon the United States retail markets and consumer spending.\n\ufeff\nTraditionally, this segment has recognized a substantial portion of its sales during the holiday selling season. Any downturn in the general economy, shift in consumer spending away from its housewares/small appliances, or further deterioration in the financial health of its customer base could adversely affect sales and operating results.\n\ufeff\nThe Company may not be successful in developing and introducing new and improved consumer products.\n\ufeff\nThe development and introduction of new housewares/small appliance products is very important to the Company\u2019s long-term success. The ability to develop new products is affected by, among other things, whether the Company can develop and fund technological innovations and successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences, as well as the intellectual property rights of others. The introduction of new products may require substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain marketplace recognition or to license intellectual property. There is no guarantee that the Company will be aware of all relevant intellectual property in the industry and may be subject to claims of infringement, which could preclude it from producing and selling a product. Likewise, there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in developing products necessary to compete effectively in the industry or that it will be successful in advertising, marketing and selling any new products.\n\ufeff\nProduct recalls or lawsuits relating to defective products could have an adverse effect on the Company, as could the imposition of industry sustainability standards.\n\ufeff\nAs distributors of consumer products in the United States, the Company is subject to the Consumer Products Safety Act, which empowers the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous. Under certain circumstances, the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission could require the Company to repair, replace or refund the purchase price of one or more of its products, or the Company may voluntarily do so. Any repurchase or recall of products could be costly and damage the Company\u2019s reputation, as well as subject it to a sizable penalty that the Commission is empowered to impose. If the Company removed products from the market, its reputation or brands could be tarnished and it might have large quantities of finished products that could not be sold.\n\ufeff\nThe Company could also face exposure to product liability claims if one of its products were alleged to have caused property damage, bodily injury or other adverse effects. It is self-insured to specified levels of those claims and maintains product liability insurance for claims above the self-insured levels. The Company may not be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms, if at all, in the future. In addition, product liability claims may exceed the amount of insurance coverage. Moreover, many states do not allow insurance companies to provide coverage of punitive damages, in the event such damages were imposed. Additionally, the Company does not maintain product recall insurance. As a result, product recalls or product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nThe portable appliance and floor care companies\u2019 industry association has a framework for a sustainability standard for the industry, but has yet to develop specific guidelines for implementation. When and if developed, the standards will do nothing for the environment, but will entail the addition of significant bureaucracy and outside certification fees. As such, compliance will be burdensome and expensive.\n\ufeff\nThe housewares/small appliance industry continues to consolidate, which could ultimately impede the Company\u2019s ability to secure product placement at key customers.\n\ufeff\nOver the past decade, the housewares/small appliance industry has undergone significant consolidation, and, as a result, the industry primarily consists of a limited number of larger companies. Larger companies do enjoy a competitive advantage in terms of the ability to offer a larger assortment of product to any one customer. As a result, the Company may find it more difficult or lose the ability to place its products with its customers.\n\ufeff\nDefense Segment:\n\ufeff\nThe Company relies primarily on sales to U.S. Government entities, and the failure to procure or the loss of a significant contract or contracts could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations.\n\ufeff\nAs the Company\u2019s sales in the Defense segment are primarily to the U.S. Government and its prime contractors, it depends heavily on the contracts underlying these programs. The loss or significant reduction of a major program in which the Company participates could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations.\n\ufeff\nA decline in or a redirection of the U.S. defense budget could result in a material decrease in the Defense segment sales and earnings.\n\ufeff\nGovernment contracts are primarily dependent upon the U.S. defense budget. During recent years, the Company\u2019s sales were augmented by increased defense spending, including supplemental appropriations for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, areas from which the U.S. has withdrawn. Future defense budgets could be negatively affected by several factors, including U.S. Government budget deficits, administration priorities, U.S. national security strategies, a change in spending priorities, and continued reduction of military operations around the world. Any significant decline or redirection of U.S. military expenditures could result in a decrease to the Company\u2019s sales and earnings.\n\ufeff\nU.S. Government contracts are also dependent on the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. As a result, at the outset of a major program, the contract is usually incrementally funded, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract by the procuring agency only as Congress makes appropriations for future fiscal years. In addition, most U.S. Government contracts are subject to modification if funding is changed. Any failure by Congress to appropriate additional funds to any program in which the Company participates, or any contract modification as a result of funding changes, could materially delay or terminate the program. This could have a material adverse effect on the results of the Company\u2019s operations.\n\ufeff\nThe Company may not be able to react to increases in its costs due to the nature of its U.S. Government contracts.\n\ufeff\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s U.S. Government contracts are fixed-price. Under fixed-price contracts, the Company agrees to perform the work for a fixed price, subject to limited escalation provisions on specified raw materials. Thus it bears the risk that any increases or unexpected costs may reduce profits or potentially cause losses on the contract, which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition. That risk is potentially compounded by the political actions under consideration by federal and state governments, including climate change and labor regulations, which could have an impact if enacted or promulgated on the availability of affordable labor, energy and ultimately, materials, as the effects of the legislation/regulation ripple throughout the economy. In addition, products are accepted by test firing samples from a production lot. Lots typically constitute a sizable amount of product. Should a sample not fire as required by the specifications, the cost to rework or scrap the entire lot could be substantial.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination.\n\ufeff\nAll of the Company\u2019s U.S. Government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. Government either for its convenience or if the Company defaults by failing to perform under the contract. Performance failure can occur from a myriad of factors, which include late shipments due to the inability to secure requisite raw materials or components or strikes or other labor unrest, equipment failures or quality issues, which result in products that do not meet specifications, etc. Termination for convenience provisions provide only for recovery of costs incurred and profit on the work completed prior to termination. Termination for default provisions provide for the contractor to be liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. Government in procuring undelivered items from another source. If a termination provision is exercised, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nFailure of the Company\u2019s subcontractors to perform their contractual obligations could materially and adversely impact contract performance.\n\ufeff\nKey components and services are provided by third party subcontractors, several of which the segment is required to work with by government edict. Under the contract, the segment is responsible for the performance of those subcontractors, many of which it does not control. There is a risk that the Company may have disputes with its subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by subcontractors. A failure by one or more of the Company\u2019s subcontractors to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services may materially and adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to perform its obligations as the prime contractor.\nU.S. Government contractors are subject to extensive laws and regulations applicable to the defense industry and the Company could be adversely affected by changes in and compliance with such laws and regulations, or any negative findings by the U.S. government regarding the Company\u2019s compliance with them.\nU.S. government contractors must comply with numerous significant procurement regulations and specific legal requirements, including a vast array of federal, state, and local laws, regulations, contract terms and requirements related to the defense industry and the Company\u2019s products and businesses. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Department of Defense FAR Supplement, Truthful Cost or Pricing Data Act, International Traffic in Arms Regulations/Arms Export Control Act, DOD 4145.26-M, and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives orders, rules and regulations. Although customary in government contracting, these regulations and legal requirements increase the Company\u2019s performance and compliance costs and risks. New laws, regulations or procurement requirements or changes to current ones (for example, regulations related to cybersecurity and related certification requirements, specialty metals, and conflict minerals) can significantly increase the Company\u2019s costs and risks and reduce profitability. Non-compliance with the laws, regulations, contract terms and processes to which the Company is subject could affect its ability to compete and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\ufeff\nSafety Segment:\n\ufeff\nThe Safety segment is comprised of businesses that are startup in nature.\nThe operations that comprise the Safety segment are startup in nature, and like most startups may not ultimately have the potential to be successful.\n\ufeff\nIncreases in the costs for raw materials, energy, transportation and other necessary supplies could adversely affect the results of the Company\u2019s operations.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s suppliers purchase significant amounts of metals, plastics, chemicals, and energy to manufacture the Company\u2019s products. Also, the cost of fuel has a major impact on transportation costs, as do intermodal shipping rates. Any increased costs that cannot be fully absorbed or passed along in the form of price increases to the customer can have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operating results.\n\ufeff\nReliance on third-party suppliers in Asia makes this segment vulnerable to supply interruptions and foreign business risks.\n\ufeff\nThe major portion of the safety products are manufactured by a handful of third-party suppliers in Asia, primarily in the People\u2019s Republic of China. The Company\u2019s ability to continue to select and develop relationships with reliable vendors who provide timely deliveries of quality parts and products will impact its success in meeting customer demand. Most products are procured on a \u201cpurchase order\u201d basis. As a result, the Company may be subject to unexpected changes in pricing or supply of products. There is no assurance that it could quickly or effectively replace any of its vendors if the need arose. Any significant failure to obtain products on a timely basis at an affordable cost or any significant delays or interruptions of supply may disrupt customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, international manufacturing is subject to significant risks, including, among others, labor unrest, adverse social, political and economic conditions, interruptions in international shipments, tariffs and other trade barriers, legal and regulatory constraints and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Although China currently enjoys \u201cmost favored nation\u201d trading status with the United States, the U.S. Government has in the past proposed to revoke that status and to impose higher tariffs on products imported from China, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. Currently, it maintains a penalty tariff on some imports and in the past has threatened to impose a penalty tariff on all products. The latter, if imposed, would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\n\ufeff\ufeff\nRegulatory constraints and authorities having jurisdiction has impeded and may continue to impede sales of certain of the segment\u2019s products.\n\ufeff\nThe commercial sales of certain of the Safety segment\u2019s products are dependent on the approval of officials that oversee fire safety at state and local levels for use of the products in areas under their jurisdiction. The inability to obtain the approval of these officials has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the segment\u2019s operating results.\n\ufeff\nVarious products in the Safety segment are reliant upon up-to-date software, hardware, and the wireless communications infrastructure.\n\ufeff\nThe effective operation of various products in the Safety segment depend on software that utilizes data obtained wirelessly via telecommunication network infrastructure. The inability of the Company to maintain software and hardware that can connect to the wireless infrastructure, failure of the wireless infrastructure, or the availability of cloud based data storage, could have a material adverse effect on the efficacy of the segment\u2019s products and in turn on its operating results.\n\ufeff\nThe segment may not be successful in developing and introducing new and improved products.\n\ufeff\nThe development and introduction of new products is very important to the Company\u2019s long-term success. The ability to develop new products is affected by, among other things, whether the Company can develop and fund technological innovations and successfully anticipate customer needs and preferences, meet Underwriters Laboratories requirements and avoid infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. The introduction of new products may require substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain marketplace recognition or to license intellectual property. There is no guarantee that the Company will be aware of all relevant intellectual property in the industry and may be subject to claims of infringement, which could preclude it from producing and selling a product. Likewise, there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in developing products necessary to compete effectively in the industry or that it will be successful in advertising, marketing and selling any new products.\n\ufeff\nAcquisition Risks:\n\ufeff\nThe Company may pursue acquisitions of new product lines or businesses. It may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or, if suitable candidates are identified, it may not be able to complete the acquisition on commercially acceptable terms. Even if the Company is able to consummate an acquisition, the transaction would present many risks, including, among others: failing to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings; difficulty incorporating and integrating the acquired technologies, services or products; coordinating, establishing or expanding sales, distribution and marketing functions, as necessary; diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns; being exposed to unanticipated or contingent liabilities or incurring the impairment of goodwill; the loss of key employees, customers, or distribution partners; and difficulties implementing and maintaining sufficient controls, policies and procedures over the systems, products and processes of the acquired company. If the Company does not achieve the anticipated benefits of its acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by management, or if others do not perceive the same benefits of the acquisition as the Company does, there could be a material, adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\ufeff\nInformation Technology System Failure or Security Breach Risks:\n\ufeff\nThe Company relies on its information technology systems to effectively manage its business data, communications, supply chain, logistics, accounting, and other business processes. While the Company endeavors to build and sustain an appropriate technology environment, information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond the Company\u2019s control, including systems failures, viruses, security breaches or cyber incidents such as intentional cyber-attacks aimed at theft of sensitive data, or inadvertent cyber-security compromises. A security breach of such systems could result in interruptions of the Company\u2019s operations, negatively impact relations with customers or employees, and expose the Company to liability and litigation, any one of which could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition. The Company\u2019s insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cyber security attacks or disruptions. Some of the Company's systems have in the past experienced security breaches, and, although to the best of the Company's knowledge as of the date of this filing, the breaches did not have a material adverse effect on its operating results or financial condition, there can be no assurance the Company will not experience material effects from security breaches in the future.\n\ufeff\nCOVID-19 or Other Pandemics, Epidemics, or Similar Public Health Crises Risks:\nThe Company may be negatively impacted by the fear of exposure to, or actual effects of, pandemics and epidemics or similar public health crises. In response to a public health crisis, national, state and local authorities have implemented a variety of measures intended to limit the spread of a disease, such as travel restrictions, social distancing or imposing quarantine and isolation measures on the population. They may implement other measures. The impacts of a public health crisis may include, but are not limited to:\nSignificant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for the Company's products, which may be caused by, among other things, the temporary inability of consumers to purchase the products due to illness, self-quarantine, travel restrictions, financial hardship, restrictions that limit access to or close customer stores, shifts in demand away from one or more of the Company's more discretionary or higher priced products to lower priced commodity products, or the inability to meet heightened demand stemming from programs like the CARES Act that provide substantial additional purchasing power to consumers;\nInability to meet the Company's customers' needs and achieve cost targets due to disruptions in distribution capabilities or the supply chain caused by the loss or disruption of essential manufacturing and supply elements such as raw materials or other finished products or components, restricted transportation or increased freight costs, reduced workforce, or other manufacturing sources and distribution processes;\nFailure of third parties on which the Company relies, including suppliers, customers, distributors, commercial banks, and external business partners, to meet their obligations to the Company, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties and may adversely impact the Company's operations;\nSignificant changes in the political environment in which the Company manufactures, sells, or distributes products, including quarantines, governmental authority actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or close operating and manufacturing or distribution facilities, restrict employees' ability to travel or perform necessary business functions, or otherwise prevent external business partners, suppliers, or customers from sufficiently staffing operations, including operations necessary for the production, distribution, sale, and support of the Company's products, which could adversely impact the Company's results;\nMassive government indebtedness resulting from its injection of money into the economy that could result in spiraling inflation, which could in turn affect the Company's liquidity, and could also result in decreases in U.S. and foreign defense budgets, which in turn could have a negative impact on the Company's sales and earnings;\nDelays or limits in the ability of the U.S. Government and other customers to perform, including making timely payments and awards to the Company, negotiating contracts and agreeing to appropriate costs for recovery, performing quality inspections, supporting testing, accepting delivery, approving security clearances (for individuals and facilities), and providing necessary personnel, equipment and facilities; or\nA prolonged period of generating lower cash from operations that could adversely affect both the Company's financial condition and the achievement of its strategic objectives.\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 34497, "SIC": 3480, "TIC": "NPK"}
