{"cik": "718937", "company": "STAAR SURGICAL CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur short and long-term success is subject to many factors that are beyond our control. Investors and prospective investors should consider carefully the following risk factors, in addition to other information contained in this report. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. We have identified below the known, significant risk factors that could affect our business and affect the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of losses that could continue in the future.\nDuring 2011, we achieved net income after reporting losses for more than ten years. However, in two of the past three years we reported losses. Our future profitability is challenged by the competitive nature of our industry and the other risks to our business detailed herein. We have an accumulated deficit of $140.4 million as of January 2, 2015. Our ability to fund our capital requirements out of our available cash and cash generated from our operations depends on a number of factors, including our ability to continue growing our existing operations. If we cannot continue to generate positive cash flow from operations, we will have to reduce our costs and try to raise working capital from other sources. These measures could materially and adversely affect our ability to execute our operations and expand our business.\nWe compete with much larger companies.\nOur competitors, including Novartis (formerly Alcon), Abbott (formerly Advanced Medical Optics, or AMO) and Valeant (formerly Bausch & Lomb) have much greater financial resources than we do and some of them have large international markets for a full suite of ophthalmic products. Their greater resources for research, development and marketing, and their greater capacity to offer comprehensive products and equipment to providers, make it difficult for us to compete. In the past, we have lost significant market share in IOL sales to some of our competitors.\nFDA compliance issues have delayed approvals and we expect to devote significant resources to maintaining compliance in the future.\nThe FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health regularly inspects our facilities to determine whether we are in compliance with the FDA Quality System Regulation, which governs such things as manufacturing practices, validation, testing, quality control, product labeling and complaint handling, and in compliance with FDA Medical Device Reporting regulations for certain adverse events and device malfunctions, and other FDA regulations. The FDA also regularly inspects for compliance with regulations governing advertising and promotional activities as well as clinical investigations.\nWhile we believe that we are substantially in compliance with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulations, quality system deficiencies observed at certain of our facilities during prior inspections have led to FDA Warning Letters and delays in product approvals until we resolved agency concerns. For example, in 2007, we received a Warning Letter identifying deficiencies in clinical study procedures, practices and documentation related to the Toric ICL, or TICL. As a result, the FDA placed an integrity hold on the TICL PMA supplement application in August 2007, which was lifted in July 2009\nOn May 27, 2014, we received the 2014 Warning Letter from the FDA citing alleged violations of current good manufacturing practice (\u201ccGMP\u201d) regulations that were identified by the FDA during an inspection of the Company\u2019s manufacturing facility in Monrovia, California between February 10, 2014 and March 21, 2014. To summarize, the 2014 Warning Letter observations require remedial action in four general areas: design control documentation; validation of software for an on-line calculator; data collection and trending of ICL vault complaints; and shelf life data on the ICL product.\u201d The 2014 Warning Letter provides that, until the Company addresses the deficiencies to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction, the FDA will not approve PMAs for the Company\u2019s Class III devices where the applications are reasonably related to the cGMP violations cited in the Warning Letter.\nBeginning on November 14, 2014 and continuing through February 4, 2015, the FDA inspected our Monrovia facility. On February 4, 2015, at the conclusion of the inspection, the FDA issued a Form FDA-483 with ten inspectional observations. The observations focus primarily on the need for adherence to and improved procedures, processes and documentation relating to design change, design transfer into specifications and production, verification and validation associated with device design and production, improvement in good documentation practices, and broader environmental monitoring.\nWe timely responded to the 2014 Warning Letter and the 2015 FDA-483 and are continuing to develop and implement our corrective action plans related to both of these issuances.\nWhile the PMA supplement remains pending, we cannot predict when, or if, the FDA will grant approval of the TICL for use in the United States.\nOur ability to continue our U.S. business depends on the continuous improvement of our quality systems and constant vigilance in our compliance with FDA regulations. Accordingly, our management expects to continue to devote significant resources and attention to those efforts for the foreseeable future. We cannot ensure that our efforts will be successful. Any failure to demonstrate substantial compliance with FDA regulations can result in enforcement actions that terminate, suspend or severely restrict our ability to continue manufacturing and selling medical devices. Please see the related risks discussed under the headings \u201c-We are subject to extensive government regulation worldwide, which increases our costs and could prevent us from selling our products\u201d and \u201c-We are subject to federal and state regulatory investigations.\u201d\nThe 2014 Warning Letter and the 2015 FDA-483 may adversely impact our operations.\nAs noted above, we received the 2014 Warning Letter and the 2015 FDA-483, have responded, and continue to develop and implement our corrective action plans relating to them. There can be no assurance that the FDA will be satisfied with the Company's response to the 2014 Warning Letter or the 2015 FDA-483. Unless and until STAAR is able to correct outstanding issues to the FDA's satisfaction, the FDA may withhold approval of new products such as the Toric ICL (TICL). In addition, the Company may be subject to additional regulatory action by the FDA, including fines, injunctions, warning letters, consent decrees, prosecution, civil money penalties, repairs, replacements, refunds, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, the FDA\u2019s refusal to grant future premarket approvals, withdrawals or suspensions of current products. Any such further action could, ultimately, be significant to our ongoing business and operations.\nFDA approval of the Visian Toric ICL, which could have a significant U.S. market, has been considerably delayed.\nAn important part of our ICL product portfolio is the TICL, a variant of the ICL that corrects both astigmatism and myopia in a single lens and that has been marketed outside the U.S. since 2001. We believe the TICL has a significant potential market in the U.S. and could accelerate growth of the overall refractive product line. We submitted a supplemental PMA for the TICL in April 2006, which remains subject to FDA review and a number of pending questions under discussion with the agency. Without the Toric ICL, the ICL product line is not likely to reach its full market potential in the U.S. On March 14, 2014 a FDA Ophthalmic Devices Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee voted favorably in response to the three questions posed to it by the FDA\u2019s Division of Ophthalmic, Neurological and Ear, Nose and Throat Devices (regarding the TICL\u2019s safety and effectiveness as well as whether the TICL\u2019s benefits outweigh its risks).\nBetween February 10, 2014 and March 21, 2014, the FDA inspected our manufacturing facility in Monrovia, California. On May 27, 2014, we received the 2014 Warning Letter from the FDA citing alleged violations of current good manufacturing practice (\u201ccGMP\u201d) regulations that were identified by the FDA during the inspection. Between November 14, 2014 and February 4, 2015, the FDA again inspected our manufacturing facility in Monrovia, California. On February 4, 2015, at the completion of this inspection, the FDA issued the FDA-483 with ten inspectional observations. Please see the related risks discussed under the headings \u201c-We are subject to extensive government regulation, which increases our costs and could prevent us from selling our products,\u201d \u201c-We are subject to federal and state regulatory investigations,\u201d and \u201cFDA compliance issues have delayed approvals and we expect to devote significant resources to maintaining compliance in the future.\u201d\n\tWhile the PMA supplement remains pending, we cannot predict when, or if, the FDA will grant approval of the TICL for use in the United States.\nThe global nature of our business may result in fluctuations and declines in our sales and profits.\nThe results of operations and the financial position of our Japanese subsidiary are reported in Japanese yen and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements, exposing us to translation risk. Year over year fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar had a $1.6 million impact on Japanese yen translated sales for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2015. In addition, we are exposed to transaction risk because some of our sales and expenses are incurred in a currency different from the U.S. dollar. Our most significant currency exposures are to the Japanese yen, the euro, and the Swiss Franc, and the exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. dollar may fluctuate substantially. As more manufacturing has shifted from Japan to the U.S. there will be increased foreign currency exposure to the Japanese yen. We have not attempted to offset our exposure to these risks by investing in derivatives or engaging in other hedging transactions.\nEconomic, social and political conditions, laws, practices and local customs vary widely among the countries in which we sell our products. Our operations outside of the U.S. face a number of risks and potential costs, enjoy less stringent protection of intellectual property and face economic, political and social uncertainty in some countries, especially in emerging markets. Our continued success as a global company depends, in part, on our ability to develop and implement policies and strategies that are effective in anticipating and managing these and other risks in the countries where we do business. These and other risks may have a material adverse effect on our operations in any particular country and on our business as a whole. For example, sales in certain Asian and developing markets may result in lower margins and higher exposure to intellectual property infringement or counterfeits. We price some of our products in U.S. dollars, and as a result changes in exchange rates can make our products more expensive in some offshore markets and reduce our sales. Inflation in emerging markets also makes our products more expensive there and increases the credit risks to which we are exposed.\nWe depend on key employees.\nWe depend on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees. The loss of a key employee could hurt our business. We could be particularly detrimental if any key employee or employees went to work for competitors. Our future success depends on our ability to identify, attract, train, motivate and retain other highly skilled personnel. Failure to do so may adversely affect our results. We do not maintain insurance policies to cover the cost of replacing the services of any of our key employees who may unexpectedly die or become disabled.\nWe rely and depend on independent distributors in international markets.\nExcept for the U.S., Canada, Japan, and Spain, we sell our products through independent distributors who generally control the importation and marketing of our product within their territories. We generally grant exclusive rights to these distributors and rely on them to understand local market conditions, to diligently sell our products and to comply with local laws and regulations. Our agreements with distributors and local laws can make it difficult for us to quickly change from a distributor who we feel is underperforming. If we do terminate an independent distributor, we may lose customers who have been dealing with that distributor. Because we do not have local staff in most of the areas covered by independent distributors, it may be difficult for us to detect failures in our distributors\u2019 performance or compliance. Actions by independent distributors that are beyond our control could result in flat or declining sales in that territory, harm to the reputation of our company or its products, or legal liability. For example, in 2014, sales to our independent distributor in Korea, our second largest market, declined by 15% compared to 2013, but in 2013 increased by 15% over 2012.\nThe success of our international operations depends on our successfully managing our foreign subsidiaries.\nWe conduct most of our international business through wholly owned subsidiaries. Managing distant subsidiaries and fully integrating them into our business is challenging. While we seek to integrate our foreign subsidiaries fully into our operations, direct supervision of every aspect of the subsidiaries\u2019 operations is impossible, and as a result we rely on the local managers and staff of these subsidiaries. Cultural factors, language differences and the local legal climate can result in misunderstandings among internationally dispersed personnel, and increase the risk of failing to meet U.S. and foreign legal requirements, including with respect to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The risk that unauthorized conduct may go undetected will always be greater in foreign subsidiaries.\nNon-compliance with anti-corruption laws could lead to penalties or harm our reputation.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the FCPA. Any failure to comply with these laws, even if inadvertent, could result in significant penalties or otherwise harm our reputation and business. Our reliance on foreign subsidiaries and independent distributors demands a high degree of vigilance in maintaining our policy against participation in corrupt activity. In many of our markets outside the U.S., doctors and hospital administrators may be deemed government officials. We periodically provide anti-corruption training to relevant employees and distributors. Other U.S. companies in the medical device and pharmaceutical field have faced criminal penalties under the FCPA for allowing their agents to deviate from appropriate practices in doing business with such individuals.\nUnfavorable economic conditions hurt sales of our refractive products.\nRefractive surgery is an elective procedure generally not covered by health insurance. Patients must pay for the procedure, frequently through installment financing arrangements. They can defer the choice to have refractive surgery if they lack the disposable income to pay for it or do not feel their income is secure. Laser refractive surgery experienced a significant decrease in demand globally with the recession that began in mid-2008, and has not fully recovered. While ICL sales growth declined globally in 2014, we believe that negative economic conditions have contributed to this decline. Economic stagnation, lack of consumer confidence or new recessions in any of our key markets, including but not limited to Korea, China, Japan, or Spain, could further slow ICL sales growth or, if severe, cause declines in sales. Because the ICL is our highest gross margin product, restricted growth or a decline in its sales could materially harm our business.\nNegative publicity concerning complications of laser eye surgery could reduce the demand for our refractive products as well.\nNegative publicity about laser eye surgery has appeared in several refractive surgery markets in 2013 and 2014. In December 2013, the Consumer Affairs Agency of the Japanese government issued an official cautionary warning for individuals interested in LASIK eyesight correction procedures. We believe this affected the volume of refractive surgery in Japan in 2014. In Korea in June 2014, a regional television station reported that outcomes from LASIK surgery harmed patients and significantly lowered their quality of life. A similar program was later broadcast on a national television station in that country. The resulting publicity broadened public awareness of the potential complications of refractive surgery and potential patient dissatisfaction, in particular as a result of LASIK and other corneal laser-based procedures. We believe this negative publicity decreased patient interest in Korea in LASIK as well as all other refractive procedures. Depending on the nature and severity of future negative publicity about refractive surgery, the growth of ICL sales could be limited or sales could decline as a result. Because nearly all candidates for refractive surgery can achieve acceptable vision through the use of spectacles or contact lenses, for most patients the decision to have refractive surgery is a lifestyle choice that depends on high confidence in achieving a satisfactory outcome. On April 25, 2008, the FDA Ophthalmic Devices Panel held a public meeting to discuss reports of medical complications and customer satisfaction following refractive surgery. In October 2009 the FDA, in collaboration with the National Eye Institute and the U.S. Department of Defense, began a major study on the quality of life for patients after LASIK surgery. The results of this study were presented in October 2014 and can be found on the FDA website. Some of the findings could amplify concerns about complications of laser refractive surgery. While these concerns could encourage patients and physicians to select the ICL as an alternative, they could also decrease patient interest in all refractive surgery, including ICL.\nWe may not realize the expected benefits of our manufacturing consolidation and tax strategies.\nSince 2011 we have invested significant resources in manufacturing consolidation and a tax strategy initiative, and we have invested approximately $6.3 million dollars to complete the consolidation. The goal is to increase profit margins by improving manufacturing efficiency, simplifying administrative and regulatory functions, and reducing tax liabilities. We cannot assure that we will achieve the expected benefits of these initiatives. Among other things, costs could exceed current estimates, product manufacturing transfers could be affected by delays or cause supply interruptions, changes in tax laws could reduce or eliminate expected benefits of some of our tax strategies, tax authorities may challenge our tax strategy, or future profit margins could be affected by a variety of factors unrelated to our level of manufacturing efficiency. In June 2013, we completed transferring IOL manufacturing from Japan to our Monrovia, California facility. In June 2014, we completed transferring ICL manufacturing from Nidau to our Monrovia, California facility, while maintaining manufacturing capabilities in Nidau. Completion of remaining consolidation may result in disruption to our business and delays in our use of tax loss carry forwards, which would adversely affect our results. For example, we experienced lower manufacturing yields in Monrovia than typically experienced in Nidau in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nOur manufacturing consolidation exposes us to risk.\nWe have described our manufacturing consolidation initiative and provided an update to our progress in the \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Overview-Other Highlights-Manufacturing Consolidation Project and Tax Strategy\u201d section of this Report. Transferring the manufacturing of medical devices is more expensive, time-consuming and riskier than similar transfers in less regulated industries. In our major markets, regulatory approval to sell our products is generally limited to the current manufacturing site, and changing the site will require applications to and approval from regulatory bodies prior to commercialization. To satisfy our own quality standards as well as regulations, we must follow strict protocols to confirm that products made at a new site are equivalent to those made at the currently approved site. Even minor changes in equipment, supplies or processes require validation. While we have placed a priority on maintaining the continuity and quality of our product supply, including increasing our inventory as safety stock during the consolidation, unanticipated delays or difficulties in the transfer process could interrupt our supply of products. Any sustained interruption in supply could cause us to lose market share and harm our business. In addition, our manufacturing consolidation results in our no longer having an alternative source of supply for the products we manufacture (for example, Collamer and silicone IOLs, Collamer ICLs and delivery systems) in the event of an earthquake or other event that disrupts our manufacturing activities in California.\nDisruptions in our supply chain or failure to adequately forecast product demand could result in significant delays or lost sales.\nThe loss of a material supplier could significantly disrupt our business. In some cases, we obtain components used in certain of our products from single sources. We and our third-party manufacturers and suppliers are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s QSR, which covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage, and shipping of our products. If we experience difficulties acquiring sufficient quantities of required materials or products from our existing suppliers, or if our suppliers are found to be non-compliant with the FDA's QSR or other applicable laws, obtaining the required regulatory approvals to use alternative suppliers may be a lengthy and uncertain process during which we could lose sales.\nOur sources of supply for raw materials may be threatened by shortages and other market forces, by natural disasters, by the supplier\u2019s failure to maintain adequate quality or a recall initiated by the supplier. Even when substitute suppliers are available, the need to certify the substitute supplier\u2019s regulatory compliance and the quality standards of the replacement material could significantly delay production and materially reduce our sales. We endeavor to mitigate this risk by maintaining adequate inventory of raw materials when practical and identifying secondary suppliers, but we cannot entirely eliminate the risk. For example, the failure of one of our suppliers could be the result of an unforeseen industry-wide problem, or the failure of our supplier could create an industry-wide shortage affecting secondary suppliers as well.\nIn particular, we obtain the proprietary collagen-based raw material used to manufacture our IOLs, ICLs and the AquaFlow Device internally from a sole source, one of our facilities in California. If the supply of these collagen-based raw materials is disrupted we know of no alternative supplier, and therefore, any such disruption could result in our inability to manufacture the products and would have a material adverse effect on STAAR. The loss of our external supply source for silicone could also cause us material harm.\nFurther, any failure by us to forecast demand for, or to maintain an adequate supply of the raw material and finished product could result in an interruption in the supply of certain products and a decline in the sale of that product. The manufacturing process to create the raw material necessary to produce some of our products is technically complex and requires significant lead-time. If our suppliers are unable to meet our manufacturing requirements, we may not be able to produce a sufficient amount of materials or products in a timely manner, which could cause a decline in our sales. For example, our supply of acrylic lenses from a third party supplier is limited by their manufacturing capacity constraints, which may result in backlog in demand. Delays in filling orders (for example, if this supplier remains unable to meet our demand for acrylic lenses and we are unable to secure an alternative supply) can result in lost sales if alternative lenses are available to the patient. If we are unable to ramp up production to meet increased demand we may not achieve our growth targets.\nWe could experience losses due to product liability claims.\nWe have been subject to product liability claims in the past and may experience such claims in the future. Product liability claims against us may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies or cause us to record a loss in excess of our deductible. A product liability claim that exceeds our insurance coverage could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if a product liability loss is covered by an insurance policy, we must generally pay for losses until they reach the level of the policy\u2019s stated deductible or retention amount after which the insurer begins paying. The payment of retentions or deductibles for a significant amount of claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAny product liability claim would divert managerial and financial resources and could harm our reputation with customers. We cannot assure you that we will not have product liability claims in the future or that such claims would not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may have limited ability to fully use our recorded tax loss carryforwards.\nWe have accumulated approximately $130.8 million of U.S. federal tax net operating loss carryforwards as of January 2, 2015, which can be used to offset taxable income in future quarters if our U.S. operations become profitable. If unused, these tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire between 2017 and 2033. Currently, when we generate profits on a consolidated basis, those profits are generated outside the U.S. and are subject to income taxes that we cannot offset with U.S. loss carryforwards. As part of our global consolidation strategy we expect to increase our profits in the U.S. enabling us to begin utilizing our tax loss carryforwards in the U.S., but unexpected changes in tax laws or delays and complications in our consolidation efforts could prevent us from realizing the benefits of this tax strategy. Moreover, under the current tax laws, if we were to experience a significant change in ownership, Internal Revenue Code Section 382 may restrict the future utilization of these tax loss carryforwards even if our U.S. operations generate significant profits.\nWe are subject to international tax laws that could affect our financial results.\nWe conduct international operations through our subsidiaries. Tax laws affecting international operations are highly complex and subject to change. Our payment of income tax in the different countries where we operate depends in part on internal settlement prices and administrative charges among STAAR and our subsidiaries. These arrangements require judgments by us and are subject to risk that tax authorities will disagree with those judgments and impose additional taxes, penalties or interest on us. In addition, transactions that we have arranged in light of current tax rules could have unforeseeable negative consequences if tax rules change.\nWe have only limited working capital and limited access to financing.\nWe began generating cash from operations in 2009 after six consecutive years when our cash requirements exceeded the level of cash generated by operations. We may not be able to sustain positive cash flow, and unexpected cash needs could exceed the amount of cash we generate, which was the case during fiscal 2014 when we used $8.0 million of our cash for operations. While we believe our capital resources and funds generated by operations are sufficient to operate our business and satisfy our obligations, if unexpected events increase our expenses or harm the performance of our business we may need to seek additional financing. We may also be presented with opportunities to expand our business that require additional financing. Should we need additional working capital, our ability to raise financing through sales of equity securities depends on general market conditions and the demand for our common stock. We may be unable to raise adequate capital through sales of equity securities, and if our stock has a low market price at the time of such sales our existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution. Because of our history of losses, we may also have difficulty obtaining debt financing on acceptable terms or renewing existing debt facilities. An inability to secure additional financing if it is needed in the future could require us to forego opportunities for expansion, reduce existing operations, or even jeopardize our ability to continue operations.\nBecause we manufacture most of our products from a single manufacturing site, if we suffer loss to our Monrovia facility due to catastrophe, or if our manufacturing sites fail to be in compliance with its regulatory approvals, our operations could be seriously harmed.\nWe depend on the continuing operation of our manufacturing facility in Monrovia, California, which is currently our sole manufacturing facility for ICLs and IOLs. Our Monrovia facility could suffer catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, earthquake, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters (including manufacturing challenges) and we would need resources (personnel and equipment) as well as additional regulatory approvals in order to manufacture our product at any second manufacturing site. Our California and Japanese facilities are in areas where earthquakes could cause catastrophic loss. If any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, or if one of our manufacturing facilities is found not to be in compliance with regulatory requirements, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility, as well as lost customers or sales. Our insurance for property damage and business interruption may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss. We do not carry insurance or reserve funds for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism.\nOur defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded and we may be subject to significant increases in pension benefit obligations under those pension plans.\nWe sponsor two defined benefit pension plans through our wholly owned Swiss and Japanese subsidiaries, which we refer to as the Swiss Plan and the Japan Plan, respectively. Both plans are underfunded and may require significant cash payments. During 2014, we contributed $241,000 to our Swiss Plan and made benefit payments of $1.1 million; although we did not contribute to our Japan Plan, we made benefit payments of $55,000.\nAs part of the Amendment of the Japan Plan discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, STAAR Japan has maintained and administered the Japan Plan, including paying the pension benefits as they are due solely from its operating cashflows. STAAR Japan is not required to make any contributions to the Japan Plan in order to meet future pension benefit obligations, and does not expect to do so. As a result, STAAR Japan has no plan assets now and does not expect to have any in the future.\nWe determine our pension benefit obligations and funding status using many assumptions, such as inflation, investment rates, mortality, turnover and interest rates, as applicable, any of which could prove to be different than projected. If the investment performance does not meet our expectations, or if other actuarial assumptions are modified, or not realized, we may be required to contribute more than we currently expect and increase our future pension benefit obligations to be funded from our operations.\nOur pension plans in the aggregate are underfunded by approximately $3.1 million ($1.0 million for the Japan Plan and $2.1 million for the Swiss Plan) as of January 2, 2015.\nIf our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our worldwide pension obligations, we may be materially and adversely harmed and have to seek additional capital.\nOur activities involve hazardous materials and emissions and may subject us to environmental liability.\nOur manufacturing, research and development activities involve the use of hazardous materials. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacturing, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and certain waste products in the places where we have operations. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. Remedial environmental actions could require us to incur substantial unexpected costs, which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations. If we were involved in an environmental accident or found to be in substantial non-compliance with applicable environmental laws, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines.\nIf we are unable to protect our information systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted.\nWe depend on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information. We depend on our information technology infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations around the world and between our personnel and our subsidiaries, customers, and suppliers. We collect and retain large volumes of internal and customer, vendor and supplier data, including some personally identifiable information, for business purposes. We also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees. The integrity and protection of our customer, vendor, supplier, employee and other Company data is critical to our business. The regulatory environment governing information, security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve. Maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulations may increase our operating costs or adversely affect our business operations.\nUnauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our team members, contractors and temporary staff. Security breaches could disrupt our operations, and we could suffer substantial financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of our suppliers, distributors and customers with which we do business, may be vulnerable to security breaches, cyber-attacks, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer, employee, supplier or Company information, whether by us or by our suppliers, distributors and customers with which we do business, could result in losses, damage our reputation, expose us to the risks of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Also, certain of our information technology systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in, among other consequences, interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial results.\nChanges in accounting standards could affect our financial results.\nThe accounting rules applicable to public companies like us are subject to frequent revision. Future changes in accounting standards could require us to change the way we calculate income, expense or balance sheet data, which could significantly change our reported results of operations or financial condition.\nOur publicly filed SEC reports may be reviewed by the SEC.\nThe reports of publicly traded companies are subject to review by the SEC from time to time for the purpose of assisting companies in complying with applicable disclosure requirements and to enhance the overall effectiveness of companies' public filings, and comprehensive reviews of such reports are now required at least every three years under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The SEC reviews may be initiated at any time. While we believe that our previously filed SEC reports comply, and we intend that all future reports will comply in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC, we could be required to modify or reformulate information contained in prior filings as a result of an SEC review. Any modification or reformulation of information contained in such reports could be significant and could result in material liability to us and have a material adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock.\nAcquisitions of technologies, products, and businesses could disrupt our business, involve increased expenses and present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions.\nWe may consider and, as appropriate, make acquisitions of technologies, products and businesses that we believe are complementary to our business. Acquisitions typically entail many risks and could result in difficulties in integrating the operations, personnel, technologies and products acquired, some of which may result in significant charges to earnings. Issues that must be addressed in acquiring and integrating the acquired technologies, products and businesses into our own include:\n\u00b7 conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, operating divisions, business cultures and compensation structures;\n\u00b7 retaining key employees;\n\u00b7 retaining existing customers and attracting new customers;\n\u00b7 consolidating operational infrastructure, including information technology, accounting systems and administration;\n\u00b7 mitigating the risk of unknown liabilities; and\n\u00b7 managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating operations.\nIf we are unable to successfully integrate our acquisitions with our existing business, we may not obtain the advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create, which may materially adversely affect our business, and our ability to develop and introduce new products. Actual costs and sales synergies, if achieved at all, may be lower than we expect and may take longer to achieve than we anticipate. Furthermore, the products of companies we acquire may overlap with our products or those of our customers, creating conflicts with existing relationships or with other commitments that are detrimental to the integrated businesses.\nThe increased use of social media platforms and mobile technologies presents new risks and challenges.\nNew technologies are increasingly used to communicate about our products and the health conditions they are intended to treat. The use of these media requires specific attention and monitoring. For example, patients may use these channels to comment on the effectiveness of a product and to report an alleged adverse event. Negative posts or comments about us or our business on any social networking web site could harm our reputation. In addition, our employees may use the social media tools and mobile technologies inappropriately, which may give rise to liability, or which could lead to the exposure of sensitive information. In either case, such uses of social media and mobile technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Ophthalmic Products Industry\nIf we recall a product, the cost and damage to our reputation could harm our business.\nMedical devices must be manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances, and often incorporate newly developed technology. From time to time defects or technical flaws in medical devices may not come to light until after the products are sold or consigned. In those circumstances, like others in our industry, we may, on our own initiative, initiate actions, including a non-reportable market withdrawal or a reportable product recall, relabeling or correction, for the purpose of correcting a material deficiency, improving device performance, or other reasons. In addition, the FDA and similar foreign health or governmental agencies have the authority to require an involuntary recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design, manufacturing or labeling or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. In the case of the FDA, the authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is a reasonable probability that a device intended for human use would cause serious, adverse health consequences or death.\nWe have voluntarily recalled our products and similar recalls could take place again. We may also be subject to recalls initiated by manufacturers of products we distribute. We believe that in recent years we have been less affected by recalls than most of our U.S. competitors, but cannot eliminate the risk of a material recall in the future. Recalls can result in lost sales of the recalled products themselves, and can result in further lost sales while replacement products are manufactured, especially if the replacements must be redesigned. If recalled products have already been implanted, we may bear some or all of the cost of corrective surgery. Recalls may also damage our professional reputation and the reputation of our products. The inconvenience caused by recalls and related interruptions in supply, the underlying causal issues, and the damage to our reputation, could cause professionals to discontinue using our products.\nCompanies are required to maintain certain records of actions, even if they determine such actions are not reportable to the FDA. If we determine that certain actions do not require notification of the FDA, the FDA may disagree with our determinations and require us to report those actions as recalls. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales. In addition, the FDA could take enforcement action for failing to report the recalls when they were conducted or failing to timely report or initiate a reportable product action. Moreover, depending on the corrective action we take to redress a product\u2019s deficiencies or defects, the FDA may require, or we may decide, that we will need to obtain new approvals or clearances for the device before we may market or distribute the corrected device. Seeking such approvals or clearances may delay our ability to replace the recalled devices in a timely manner. Moreover, if we do not adequately address problems associated with our devices, we may face additional regulatory enforcement action, including FDA warning letters, product seizure, injunctions, administrative penalties, or civil or criminal fines or prosecutions.\nIf our products, or malfunction of our products, cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions.\nUnder the FDA regulations, we are required to report to the FDA any incident in which our product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. In addition, all manufacturers placing medical devices in European Union markets are legally bound to report any serious or potentially serious incidents involving devices they produce or sell to the relevant authority in whose jurisdiction the incident occurred. We anticipate that in the future we will experience events that would require reporting to the FDA pursuant to the MDR regulations. Any adverse event involving our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as product actions or customer notifications, or agency actions, such as inspection, mandatory recall or other enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nThe decision to file an MDR involves a judgment by us as the manufacturer. We have made decisions that certain types of events are not reportable under the MDR regulations; however, there can be no assurance that the FDA will agree with our decisions. If we fail to report MDRs to the FDA within the required timeframes, or at all, or if the FDA disagrees with any of our determinations regarding the reportability of certain events, the FDA could take enforcement actions against us, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation and financial results.\nIf we fail to keep pace with advances in our industry or fail to persuade physicians to adopt the new products we introduce, customers may not buy our products and our sales may decline.\nConstant development of new technologies and techniques, frequent new product introductions and strong price competition characterize the ophthalmic industry. The first company to introduce a new product or technique to market usually gains a significant competitive advantage. Our future growth depends, in part, on our ability to develop products to treat diseases and disorders of the eye that are more effective, safer, or incorporate emerging technologies better than our competitors\u2019 products. Sales of our existing products may decline rapidly if one of our competitors introduces a superior product, or if we announce a new product of our own. If we fail to make sufficient investments in research and development or if we focus on technologies that do not lead to better products, our current and planned products could be surpassed by more effective or advanced products. In addition, we must manufacture these products economically and market them successfully by demonstrating to a sufficient number of eye-care professionals the overall benefits of using them.\nResources devoted to research and development may not yield new products that achieve commercial success.\nWe spent about 16.5% of our sales on research and development, including FDA-related panel, remediation, and inspection costs, during the fiscal year ended January 2, 2015. Development of new implantable technology, from discovery through testing and registration to initial product launch, is expensive and typically takes from three to seven years. Because of the complexities and uncertainties of ophthalmic research and development, products we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory approvals required for us to market the products successfully. Any of the products currently under development may fail to become commercially successful.\nChanges in coverage and reimbursement for our products by third-party payers and the new Medical Device Tax could reduce sales of our products or make them less profitable.\nCertain of our products, such as our IOLs, are used in procedures that are typically covered by health insurance, HMO plans, Medicare, Medicaid, or other governmental sponsored programs both in and outside the U.S. Third-party payers in both government and the private sector continue to seek to manage costs by restricting the types of procedures they cover to those viewed as most cost-effective and by capping or reducing reimbursement rates. Whether they limit reimbursement rates for our products or limit the surgical fees for a procedure that uses our products, these policies can reduce the sales volume of our covered products, their selling prices or both. Future cost cutting initiatives could result in unexpected reductions in the reimbursement rates for IOLs and related products.\nIn some countries government insurers have sought to control costs by limiting the total number of procedures they will reimburse. In the U.S. the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Health Care Reform Law, is expected to significantly change the system of public and private health care reimbursement. The Health Care Reform Law includes, among other things, a 2.3% excise tax on medical devices sold in the U.S., which applies to sales of our IOLs. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Health Care Reform Law was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which, among other things, creates the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers.\nFuture legislation will likely consider further changes that may impact availability and/or pricing for cataract surgery where our IOLs are used. We are not able to predict whether new legislation or changes in regulations will take effect at the state or federal level, but if enacted these changes could significantly and adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation worldwide, which increases our costs and could prevent us from selling our products.\nWe are regulated by regional, national, state and local agencies. In the U.S. our regulators include the FDA, the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and other regulatory bodies, as well as governmental authorities in those foreign countries in which we manufacture or distribute products. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern the research, development, manufacturing and commercial activities relating to medical devices, including their design, pre-clinical and clinical testing, clearance or approval, production, labeling, sale, distribution, import, export, post-market surveillance, advertising, dissemination of information and promotion.\nWe are subject to similar regulatory regimes in other key regions of Europe and Asia, in particular Japan. Regulations worldwide are becoming more stringent. We have described in detail the regulations governing approval of medical devices and their manufacturing in the \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulatory Matters\u201d section of this Annual Report. We are also subject to government regulation over the prices we charge and any rebates we may offer to customers. Complying with government regulation substantially increases the cost of developing, manufacturing and selling our products.\nCompeting in the ophthalmic products industry requires us to introduce new or improved products and processes continuously, and to submit these to the FDA and other regulatory bodies for clearance or approval. Obtaining clearance or approval can be a long and expensive process, and clearance or approval is never certain. For example, the FDA or another country\u2019s regulatory agency, could require us to conduct an additional clinical trial prior to granting clearance or approval of a product and such clinical trial could take a long time and have substantial expense. In addition, our operations are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and international regulators. An unfavorable outcome in an FDA inspection may result in the FDA ordering changes in our business practices or taking other enforcement action, which could be costly and severely harm our business.\nOur new products could take a significantly longer time than we expect to gain regulatory clearance or approval and may never gain clearance or approval. The FDA can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of a device for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7 we may not be able to demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction that our products are safe and effective for their intended uses;\n\u00b7 the data from our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance or approval, where required; and\n\u00b7 the manufacturing process or facilities we use may not meet applicable requirements.\nIf a regulatory authority delays approval of a potentially significant product, the potential sales of the product and its value to us can be substantially reduced. Even if the FDA or another regulatory agency clears or approves a product, the clearance or approval may limit the indicated uses of the product, or may otherwise limit our ability to promote, sell and distribute the product, or may require post-marketing studies. If we cannot obtain timely regulatory clearance or approval of our new products, or if the clearance or approval is too narrow, we will not be able to market these products, which would eliminate or reduce our potential sales and earnings.\nIn addition, the FDA and other regulatory authorities may change their clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently cleared products on a timely basis. For example, in response to industry and healthcare provider concerns regarding the predictability, consistency and rigor of the 510(k) regulatory pathway, the FDA initiated an evaluation of the program, and in January 2011, announced several proposed actions intended to reform the review process governing the clearance of medical devices. The FDA intends these reform actions to improve the efficiency and transparency of the clearance process, as well as bolster patient safety. In addition, as part of FDASIA, Congress reauthorized the Medical Device User Fee Amendments with various FDA performance goal commitments and enacted several \u201cMedical Device Regulatory Improvements\u201d and miscellaneous reforms which are further intended to clarify and improve medical device regulation both pre- and post-approval.\nEven after we have obtained the proper regulatory clearance or approval to market a product, we have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. The failure to comply with applicable regulations could jeopardize our ability to sell our products and result in enforcement actions such as warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, termination of distribution, recalls or seizures of products, delays in the introduction of products into the market, total or partial suspension of production, refusal to grant future clearances or approvals, withdrawals or suspensions of current clearances or approvals resulting in prohibitions on sales of our products, and criminal penalties. Any of these sanctions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nModifications to our products may require new 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals, or may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified products until clearances or approvals are obtained.\nAny modification to a 510(k)-cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, including any significant change in design or manufacture, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, possibly, approval of a PMA. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA may review any manufacturer\u2019s decision. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances or approvals are necessary. We have modified some of our 510(k) cleared products, and have determined based on our review of the applicable FDA guidance that in certain instances new 510(k) clearances or pre-market approvals are not required. If the FDA disagrees with our determination and requires us to submit new 510(k) notifications or PMAs for modifications to our previously cleared products for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.\nFurthermore, the FDA\u2019s ongoing review of the 510(k) program may make it more difficult for us to make modifications to our previously cleared products, either by imposing more strict requirements on when a manufacturer must submit a new 510(k) for a modification to a previously cleared product, or by applying more onerous review criteria to such submissions. Specifically, on July 9, 2012, FDASIA was enacted, which, among other requirements, obligated the FDA to prepare a report for Congress on the FDA\u2019s approach for determining when a new 510(k) will be required for modifications or changes to a previously cleared device and to wait at least a year following submission of this report to issue revised guidance for industry on this topic. FDA submitted its report to Congress in January 2014and is expected to issue draft revised guidance for public comment at some time in the future prior to issuing final guidance for implementation. Until the FDA issues final, revised guidance to assist device manufacturers in determining when to submit a new 510(k) for a change or modification to a previously cleared device, manufacturers may continue to adhere to the FDA\u2019s 1997 Guidance on this topic when making this determination, but the practical impact of the FDA\u2019s continuing and evolving scrutiny of these issues remains unclear.\nLaws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws, physician self-referral laws and false claims laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration health programs and TRICARE. Similarly, if the physicians or other providers or entities with which we do business are found to be non-compliant with applicable laws, they may be subject to sanctions, which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws, because of the complex and far-reaching nature of these laws, there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws. These laws and regulations act to limit our marketing practices, require the dedication of resources to ensure compliance, and expose us to additional liabilities.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the recent Health Care Reform Law, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The Health Care Reform Law also provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of these statutes constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute.\nThere has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians. The Health Care Reform Law imposed new reporting requirements on device manufacturers for payments made by them and in some cases, their distributors, to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members, commonly known as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for \u201cknowing failures\u201d), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Device manufacturers were required to begin collecting data on August 1, 2013 and must submit reports to CMS by March 31, 2014, and by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year.\nCertain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements.\nAchieving and sustaining compliance with these laws may prove costly. In addition, any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, imprisonment, or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our reputation and our financial results.\nIn addition, changes in these laws, regulations, or administrative or judicial interpretations, may require us to further change our business practices or subject our existing business practices to legal challenges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInvestigations and allegations, whether or not they lead to enforcement action or litigation, can materially harm our business and our reputation.\nFailure to comply with the requirements of the FDA or other regulators can result in civil and criminal fines, the recall of products, the total or partial suspension of manufacture or distribution, seizure of products, injunctions, whistleblower lawsuits, failure to obtain approval of pending product applications, withdrawal of existing product approvals, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and other sanctions. Any threatened or actual government enforcement action can also generate adverse publicity and require us to divert substantial resources from more productive uses in our business. Enforcement actions could affect our ability to distribute our products commercially and could materially harm our business.\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries by regulatory agencies, which could lead to investigations or enforcement actions. Even when an inquiry results in no evidence of wrongdoing, is inconclusive or is otherwise not pursued, the agency generally is not required to notify us of its findings and may not inform us that the inquiry has been terminated.\nAs required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we maintain a hotline for employees to report any violation of laws, regulations or company policies anonymously, which is intended to permit us to identify and remedy improper conduct. Nevertheless, present or former employees may elect to bring complaints to regulators and enforcement agencies. The relevant agency will generally be obligated to investigate such complaints to assess their validity and obtain evidence of any violation that may have occurred. In response to reports that our policies or applicable laws or regulations have been violated, we may find it necessary to conduct our own internal investigations, which may be extensive. Even without a finding of misconduct, negative publicity about investigations or allegations of misconduct could harm our reputation with professionals and the market for our common stock. Responding to investigations or conducting internal investigations can be costly, time-consuming and disruptive to our business.\nStrikes, slow-downs or other job actions by doctors can reduce sales of cataract-related products.\nIn many countries where we sell our products, doctors, including ophthalmologists, are employees of the government, government-sponsored enterprises or large health maintenance organizations. In the past, employed doctors who object to salary limitations, working rules, reimbursement policies or other conditions have sought redress through strikes, slow-downs and other job actions. These actions often result in the deferral of non-essential procedures, such as cataract surgeries, which affects sales of our products. Depending on the importance of the affected region to our business, the length of the action and its pervasiveness, job actions by doctors can materially reduce our sales and earnings.\nWe depend on proprietary technologies, but may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights adequately.\nWe rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrecy laws, contractual provisions and confidentiality procedures and copyright laws to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology. These legal measures afford limited protection and may not prevent our competitors from gaining access to our intellectual property and proprietary information. Any of our patents may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. Also, several of our patents expire within the next couple of years, which may expose our technologies to competitors. Any of our pending patent applications may fail to result in an issued patent or fail to provide meaningful protection against competitors or competitive technologies. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights. Any litigation could result in substantial expense, may reduce our profits and may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our products infringe their intellectual property rights. This risk is exacerbated by the fact that the validity and breadth of claims covered by patents in our industry may involve complex legal issues that are open to dispute. Any litigation or claims against us, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and harm our reputation. Intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u00b7 cease selling or using any of our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, which would adversely affect our sales;\n\u00b7 negotiate a license from the holder of the intellectual property right alleged to have been infringed, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all; or\n\u00b7 re-design our products to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of a third party, which may be costly and time-consuming or impossible to accomplish.\nWe may not successfully develop and launch replacements for our products that lose patent protection.\nMost of our products are covered by patents that, if valid, give us a degree of market exclusivity during the term of the patent. We have also earned revenue in the past by licensing some of our patented technology to other ophthalmic companies. Generally, the legal life of a patent in the U.S. is 20 years from application. When our patents covering our products expire, some of which will expire this year, our competitors may introduce products using the same technology. As a result of this possible increase in competition, we may need to reduce our prices to maintain sales of our products, which would make them less profitable. If we fail to develop and successfully launch new products prior to the expiration of patents for our existing products, our sales and profits with respect to those products could decline significantly. We may not be able to develop and successfully launch more advanced replacement products before these and other patents expire.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur charter documents could delay or prevent an acquisition or sale of our company.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation empowers the Board of Directors to establish and issue a class of preferred stock, and to determine the rights, preferences and privileges of the preferred stock. These provisions give the Board of Directors the ability to deter, discourage or make more difficult a change in control of our company, even if such a change in control could be deemed in the interest of our stockholders or if such a change in control would provide our stockholders with a substantial premium for their shares over the then-prevailing market price for the common stock. Our bylaws contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, including the following:\n\u00b7 stockholders have limited ability to remove directors;\n\u00b7 stockholders cannot act by written consent;\n\u00b7 stockholders cannot call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u00b7 the above limitations on stockholder action can be changed only by a 66-2/3% supermajority vote of stockholders; and\n\u00b7 stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or propose other business.\nAnti-takeover provisions of Delaware law could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company.\nWe are generally subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which regulates corporate acquisitions. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock or prevent changes in our management.\nFuture sales of our common stock could reduce our stock price.\nOur Board of Directors could issue additional shares of common or preferred stock to raise additional capital or for other corporate purposes without stockholder approval. In addition, the Board of Directors could designate and sell a class of preferred stock with preferential rights over the common stock with respect to dividends or other distributions. Also, we have filed a universal \u201cshelf registration statement\u201d with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The shelf registration statement covers the future public offering and sale of up to $200 million in equity or debt securities or any combination of such securities. While we currently have no plans to issue any securities under the shelf registration, sales of common or preferred stock under the shelf registration or in other transactions could dilute the interest of existing stockholders and reduce the market price of our common stock. Even in the absence of such sales, the perception among investors that additional sales of equity securities may take place could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile.\nOur stock price has fluctuated widely. The closing price of our common stock ranged from $8.60 to $19.35 per share during the year ended January 2, 2015. Our stock price could continue to experience significant fluctuations in response to factors such as market perceptions, quarterly variations in operating results, operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors, changes in financial estimates, changes in market valuations of competitors, announcements by us or our competitors of a material nature, additions or departures of key personnel, future sales of Common Stock and stock volume fluctuations. Also, general political and economic conditions such as recession or interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nBecause we do not intend to pay dividends, stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock since our inception. We currently expect to retain any earnings for use to further develop our business, and do not expect to declare cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The declaration and payment of any such dividends in the future depends upon our earnings, financial condition, capital needs and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors, and may be restricted by future agreements with lenders. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares.", "PERMNO": 72304, "SIC": 3851, "TIC": "STAA"}
