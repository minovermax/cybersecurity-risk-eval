{"cik": "59558", "company": "LINCOLN NATIONAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\ufeff\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected. In that case, the value of our securities could decline substantially.\n\ufeff\nLegislative, Regulatory and Tax\n\ufeff\nOur businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may affect our insurance subsidiary capital requirements or reduce our profitability.\n\ufeff\nState Regulation\n\ufeff\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which we do business. The supervision and regulation relate to numerous aspects of our business and financial condition. The primary purpose of the supervision and regulation is the protection of our insurance contract holders, and not our investors. The extent of regulation varies, but generally is governed by state statutes. These statutes delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative authority to state insurance departments. This system of supervision and regulation covers, among other things:\n\u00b7\nMarket conduct standards;\n\u00b7\nStandards of minimum capital requirements and solvency, including RBC measurements;\n\u00b7\nRestrictions on certain transactions, including, but not limited to, reinsurance between our insurance subsidiaries and their affiliates;\n\u00b7\nRestrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;\n\u00b7\nRestrictions on the receipt of reinsurance credit;\n\u00b7\nRestrictions on the types of terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our primary insurance operations;\n\u00b7\nLimitations on the amount of dividends that insurance subsidiaries can pay;\n\u00b7\nLicensing status of the company;\n\u00b7\nCertain required methods of accounting pursuant to statutory accounting principles (\u201cSAP\u201d);\n\u00b7\nReserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes;\n\u00b7\nPayment of policy benefits (claims); and\n\u00b7\nAssignment of residual market business and potential assessments for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain policies provided by impaired, insolvent or failed insurance companies.\n\ufeff\nState insurance regulators and the NAIC regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, sometimes lead to additional expense, statutory reserves and/or RBC requirements for the insurer and, thus, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, the NAIC is currently in the process of implementing changes to the accounting, reserve and RBC regulations related to the variable annuity business; however, this effort is still ongoing, and we are still evaluating what impact it could have on our financial condition or results of operations. The NAIC is also considering modifications to the NAIC RBC C-1 capital charges for bonds, which may impact the level of the C-1 related RBC we are required to hold.\n\ufeff\nAlthough we endeavor to maintain all required licenses and approvals, our businesses may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority\u2019s interpretation of the laws and regulations, which may change from time to time. Also, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew or revoke licenses and approvals. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose substantial fines. Further, insurance regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to issue orders of supervision, which permit such authorities to supervise the business and operations of an insurance company. As of December 31, 2018, no state insurance regulatory authority had imposed on us any material fines or revoked or suspended any of our licenses to conduct insurance business in any state or issued an order of supervision with respect to our insurance subsidiaries, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\n\ufeff\nAttempts to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline 38 may fail in whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (\u201cXXX\u201d) requires insurers to establish additional statutory reserves for term life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees and UL policies with secondary guarantees. In addition, Actuarial Guideline 38 (\u201cAG38\u201d) clarifies the application of XXX with respect to certain UL insurance policies with secondary guarantees. A portion of our newly issued term and a portion of our newly issued UL insurance products are affected by XXX and AG38; certain term policies issued in 2017 and later are now reserved under principles-based reserves. The application of both AG38 and XXX involve numerous interpretations. If state insurance departments do not agree with our interpretations, we may have to increase reserves related to such policies. The New York State Department of Financial Services did not recognize the NAIC revisions to AG38 in applying the New York law governing the reserves to be held for UL and VUL products containing secondary guarantees. The change, which was effective as of December 31, 2013, impacted our New York-domiciled insurance subsidiary, LLANY. Although LLANY discontinued the sale of these products in early 2013, the change affected those policies previously sold. As a result, we phased in an increase in reserves over five years, from 2013 to 2017, resulting in a total increase of $450 million.\n\ufeff\nWe have implemented, and plan to continue to implement, reinsurance and capital management transactions to mitigate the capital impact of XXX and AG38, including the use of captive reinsurance subsidiaries. The NAIC adopted Actuarial Guideline 48 (\u201cAG48\u201d) regulating the terms of these arrangements that are entered into or amended in certain ways after December 31, 2014. This guideline imposed restrictions on the types of assets that can be used to support the reinsurance in these kinds of transactions. While we have executed AG48 compliant reserve financing transactions, we cannot provide assurance that in light of AG48 and/or future rules and regulations or changes in interpretations by state insurance departments that we will be able to continue to efficiently implement transactions or take other actions to mitigate the impact of XXX or AG38 on future sales of term and UL insurance products and any required reserves. If we are unable to continue to efficiently implement such solutions for any reason, we may realize lower than anticipated returns and/or reduced sales on such products.\n\ufeff\nCompliance with existing and emerging privacy regulations could result in increased compliance costs and/or lead to changes in business practices and policies, and any failure to protect the confidentiality of client information could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe collection and maintenance of personal data from our customers, including personally identifiable non-public financial and health information, subjects us to regulation under global, federal and state privacy laws. These laws require that we institute certain policies and procedures in our business to safeguard personal data from our customers from improper use or disclosure. The laws vary by jurisdiction, and it is expected that additional regulations will continue to be enacted. In March 2017, New York\u2019s cybersecurity regulation for financial services institutions, including banking and insurance entities, became effective, and on October 24, 2017, the NAIC adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law, and states are adopting versions of the model, establishing new standards for data security and for the investigation of and notification of insurance commissioners of cybersecurity events. Other states have proposed or adopted broad privacy legislation that applies to all types of businesses, including California, which passed the California Consumer Right to Privacy Act in June 2018, granting new data protections and rights to California consumers. In addition, the European General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) adopted by the European Commission became effective in May 2018. GDPR includes numerous protections for EU data subjects, including but not limited to notification requirements for data breaches, the right to access personal data, and the right to be forgotten. Complying with these and other existing, emerging and changing privacy requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and policies. Non-compliance could result in monetary penalties or significant legal liability.\n\ufeff\nMany of the associates who conduct our business have access to, and routinely process, personal information of clients through a variety of media, including information technology systems. We rely on various internal processes and controls to protect the confidentiality of client information that is accessible to, or in the possession of, our company and our associates. It is possible that an associate could,\nintentionally or unintentionally, disclose or misappropriate confidential client information or our data could be the subject of a cybersecurity attack. If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls or if our associates fail to comply with our policies and procedures, misappropriation or intentional or unintentional inappropriate disclosure or misuse of client information could occur. Such internal control inadequacies or non-compliance could materially damage our reputation or lead to regulatory, civil or criminal investigations and penalties, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, we analyze customer data to better manage our business. There has been increased scrutiny, including from U.S. state and federal regulators, regarding the use of \u201cbig data\u201d techniques such as price optimization. We cannot predict what, if any, actions may be taken with regard to \u201cbig data,\u201d but any inquiries could cause reputational harm, and any limitations could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nFederal Regulation\n\ufeff\nIn addition, our broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiaries as well as our variable annuities and variable life insurance products, are subject to regulation and supervision by the SEC and FINRA. These laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies and self-regulatory organizations broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the subsidiaries from carrying on their businesses in the event that they fail to comply with such laws and regulations. The foregoing regulatory or governmental bodies, as well as the DOL and others, have the authority to review our products and business practices and those of our agents, advisers, registered representatives, associated persons and employees. In recent years, there has been increased scrutiny of the insurance industry by these bodies, which has included more extensive examinations, regular sweep inquiries and more detailed review of disclosure documents. These regulatory or governmental bodies may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our agents or employees, are improper. These actions can result in substantial fines, penalties or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\n\ufeff\nRegulations relating to the standard of care applicable to investment advisers and broker-dealers could result in additional disclosure and other requirements related to the sale and delivery of our products and services.\n\ufeff\nIn 2016, the DOL released the DOL Fiduciary Rule, which became effective on June 9, 2017, and substantially expanded the range of activities considered to be fiduciary investment advice under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. On March 15, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (the \u201cFifth Circuit\u201d) issued an opinion in the case Chamber of Commerce v. the U.S. Department of Labor vacating the DOL Fiduciary Rule and related applicable exemptions. The DOL and the Department of Justice did not appeal the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, and on June 21, 2018, the Fifth Circuit issued a mandate stating that the original definition of \u201cfiduciary,\u201d including the original five-part test, will apply going forward.\n\ufeff\nOn April 18, 2018, the SEC proposed \u201cRegulation Best Interest,\u201d including a new standard of conduct for broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would require a broker-dealer to act in the best interest of a retail customer when making a recommendation of any securities transaction, without putting its financial interests ahead of the interests of a retail customer. The proposed rule includes guidance on what constitutes a \u201crecommendation\u201d and a definition of who would be a \u201cretail customer\u201d in addition to provisions setting forth certain required disclosures, policies and procedures to identify conflicts of interest, and customer-specific best interest obligations.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, the SEC proposed the use of a new disclosure document, the customer or client relationship summary, or Form CRS. Form CRS is intended to provide retail investors with information about the nature of their relationship with their investment professional and would supplement other more detailed disclosures, including existing Form ADV for advisers and the new disclosures under Regulation Best Interest for broker-dealers.\n\ufeff\nFinally, the SEC proposed interpretative guidance providing clarity on an investment adviser\u2019s fiduciary obligation under the Advisers Act. The guidance indicates that investment advisers have a fiduciary duty to their clients that includes both a duty of care and a duty of loyalty and provides additional clarification of an investment adviser\u2019s responsibilities under these fiduciary duties. Investment advisers and broker-dealers would also need to disclose their registration status with the SEC in certain retail investor communications. The comment period on the proposals closed on August 7, 2018.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to the SEC proposed rules, the NAIC and several states, including Nevada, New Jersey and New York have proposed and/or enacted laws and regulations requiring investment advisers, broker-dealers and/or agents to disclose conflicts of interest to clients and/or to meet a higher standard of care when providing advice to their clients. These recent developments could result in additional requirements related to the sale of our products.\n\ufeff\nIt is uncertain at this point how the original DOL definition of \u201cfiduciary\u201d will work in conjunction with any final rules adopted by the SEC, the NAIC or any individual state. While we continue to monitor and evaluate the various proposals, we cannot predict what other proposals may be made, or what new legislation or regulation may be introduced or become law. Therefore, until such time as final rules or laws are in place, the potential impact on our business is uncertain.\n\ufeff\nChanges in U.S. federal income tax law could impact our tax costs and the products that we sell.\n\ufeff\nIn late 2017, President Trump signed the Tax Act into law. The Tax Act included tax rate reductions for both individuals and businesses (corporations and unincorporated entities), with the reduction in the U.S. marginal tax rate for corporations from 35% to 21% being one of the central provisions of the Tax Act. The Tax Act also expanded the tax base through the elimination or reduction of specified deductions and credits and provided incentives related to growth and development.\nThe changes made by the Tax Act continue to have numerous impacts on our business. Notably, the change to the new 21% marginal corporate income tax rate has resulted in a lower overall effective tax rate as applied to our financial earnings as compared to years prior to the change. The marginal rate change resulted in a reduction in our recorded deferred tax liability for GAAP purposes, a reduction in our admitted deferred tax asset recorded for statutory reporting and, for year-end 2018 reporting, changes to the factors used in determining our required surplus for statutory purposes and related RBC percentage. Any future change in the marginal corporate tax rate will have an impact on our financial results.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to the corporate tax rate reduction provided by the Tax Act, there were several provisions that are specific to insurance companies, namely changes to the proration formula used to determine the amount of dividends eligible for the dividends-received deduction, modifications to the calculation of tax reserves associated with policyholder liabilities, changes to the computations of capitalized expenses for tax purposes of amounts incurred to originate or acquire insurance contracts (commonly referred to as the DAC tax) and the imposition of new life settlement reporting rules. As a result of one of the specific Tax Act changes, the recorded tax benefit for the separate account dividends-received deduction included in our 2018 income tax provision was $78 million as compared to $210 million for 2017. These provisions as a whole resulted in changes to our overall cash tax obligations beginning in 2018.\n\ufeff\nThe IRS and Treasury have issued guidance in regard to specific provisions contained in the Tax Act. The released guidance has been in the form of notices, proposed regulations and, in certain instances, final regulations. We continue to review and analyze the guidance as it is released in order to ensure that our initial interpretations of the law changes were appropriate and that our estimates of the post-enactment impacts were reasonable. Should final guidance in any form differ from preliminary guidance or from our initial interpretations, it could have an impact on our financial results and other related key financial measures. Specifically, in the event that final guidance related to the Tax Act differs from our current interpretation of the provisions, or if additional tax legislation is enacted (inclusive or exclusive of a change in the marginal corporate tax rate), there could be an impact on our future earnings, GAAP equity and statutory RBC, free cash flows and the sales, pricing and profitability of our products.\n\ufeff\nLegal and regulatory actions are inherent in our businesses and could result in financial losses or harm our businesses.\n\ufeff\nWe are, and in the future may be, subject to legal and regulatory actions in the ordinary course of our insurance and retirement operations. Pending legal actions include proceedings relating to aspects of our businesses and operations that are specific to us and proceedings that are typical of the businesses in which we operate. Some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants. In certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. Substantial legal liability in these or future legal or regulatory actions could have a material financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation, which in turn could materially harm our business prospects. See Note 14 for a description of legal and regulatory proceedings and actions.\n\ufeff\nImplementation of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act may subject us to substantial additional federal regulation, and we cannot predict the effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\n\ufeff\nSince it was enacted in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act has brought wide-ranging changes to the financial services industry, including changes to the rules governing derivatives; a study by the SEC of the rules governing broker-dealers and investment advisers with respect to individual investors and investment advice, followed by proposed rulemaking; the creation of a Federal Insurance Office within the U.S. Treasury to gather information and make recommendations regarding regulation of the insurance industry; the creation of a resolution authority to unwind failing institutions; the creation of a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to protect consumers of certain financial products; and changes to executive compensation and certain corporate governance rules, among other things.\n\ufeff\nSignificant rulemaking across numerous agencies within the federal government has been implemented since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. Complete implementation has yet to take place, given shifting priorities following the U.S. 2016 election; therefore, the ultimate impact of these provisions on our businesses (including product offerings), results of operations and liquidity and capital resources remains uncertain.\n\ufeff\nChanges in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements.\n\ufeff\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP as identified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards CodificationTM (\u201cASC\u201d). From time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance that are incorporated into the FASB ASC. It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nSpecifically, in August 2018, the FASB released Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2018-12, Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts, that is expected to result in significant changes to how we account for and report our insurance contracts (both in-force and new business), including updating assumptions used to measure the liability for future policy benefits for traditional and limited-payment contracts, measurement of market risk benefits and amortization of deferred acquisition costs (\u201cDAC\u201d). These changes may impose special demands on companies in the areas of employee training, internal controls, contract fulfillment and disclosure and may affect how we manage our business, including business processes such as design of compensation plans, product design, etc. The effective date is January 1, 2021, and there are various transition methods by topic that we may elect upon adoption. We will report results under the new accounting method as of the effective date, as well as for all periods presented. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. See Note 2 for more information.\n\ufeff\nOur domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to SAP. Any changes in the method of calculating reserves for our life insurance and annuity products under SAP may result in increased reserve requirements.\n\ufeff\nThe NAIC adopted an updated framework for the statutory accounting and capital requirements for variable annuities in the summer of 2018. Changes to implement the framework into detailed regulations are currently underway and are expected to be effective January 1, 2020, with an optional phase-in period and early adoption permitted. The resulting new variable annuity framework will likely result in changes in reserve and/or capital requirements and statutory surplus and could impact the volatility of those item(s). Although we are still evaluating the potential impact of the changes on our financial condition and results of operations, we do not currently expect the impact will be material. The NAIC is also considering modifications to the NAIC RBC C-1 capital charges for bonds, which may impact the level of the C-1 related RBC we are required to hold.\n\ufeff\nAnti-takeover provisions could delay, deter or prevent our change in control, even if the change in control would be beneficial to LNC shareholders.\n\ufeff\nWe are an Indiana corporation subject to Indiana state law. Certain provisions of Indiana law could interfere with or restrict takeover bids or other change in control events affecting us. Under Indiana law, directors may, in considering the best interests of a corporation, consider the effects of any action on shareholders, employees, suppliers and customers of the corporation and the communities in which offices and other facilities are located, and other factors the directors consider pertinent. One statutory provision prohibits, except under specified circumstances, LNC from engaging in any business combination with any shareholder who owns 10% or more of our common stock (which shareholder, under the statute, would be considered an \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d) for a period of five years following the time that such shareholder became an interested shareholder, unless such business combination is approved by the Board of Directors prior to such person becoming an interested shareholder.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to the anti-takeover provisions of Indiana law, there are other factors that may delay, deter or prevent our change in control. As an insurance holding company, we are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled. The insurance holding company acts and regulations restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company without prior regulatory approval. Under those statutes and regulations, without such approval (or an exemption), no person may acquire any voting security of a domestic insurance company, or an insurance holding company which controls an insurance company, or merge with such a holding company, if as a result of such transaction such person would \u201ccontrol\u201d the insurance holding company or insurance company. \u201cControl\u201d is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10% or more of the voting securities of another person.\n\ufeff\nMarket Conditions\n\ufeff\nWeak conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nOur results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally, both in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world. The unwinding of conventional easing from major central banks, slowing of global growth, continued impact of falling global energy and other commodity prices, and the ability of the U.S. government to proactively address the fiscal imbalance remain key challenges for markets and our business. These macro-economic conditions may have an adverse effect on us given our credit and equity market exposure. In the event of extreme prolonged market events, such as the global credit crisis and recession that occurred during 2008 and 2009, we could incur significant losses. Even in the absence of a market downturn, we are exposed to substantial risk of loss and downgrades due to market volatility.\n\ufeff\nFactors such as consumer spending, business investment, domestic and foreign government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, the potential for inflation or deflation and uncertainty over domestic and foreign government actions all affect the business and economic environment and, ultimately, the amount and profitability of our business. In an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment, lower disposable income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending, the demand for our financial and insurance products could be adversely affected. In addition, we may experience an elevated incidence of claims and lapses or surrenders of policies. Our contract holders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether. Adverse changes in the economy could affect earnings negatively and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nChanges in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals.\n\ufeff\nInterest rate fluctuations and/or a sustained period of low interest rates could negatively affect our profitability. Some of our products, principally fixed annuities and UL, including IUL and linked-benefit UL, have interest rate guarantees that expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce our spread, or the difference between the amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts and the amounts we are able to earn on our general account investments intended to support our obligations under the contracts. Spreads are an important component of our net income. Declines in our spread or instances where the returns on our general account investments are not enough to support the interest rate guarantees on these products could have a material adverse effect on our businesses or results of operations. In addition, low rates increase the cost of providing variable annuity living benefit guarantees, which could negatively affect our variable annuity profitability.\n\ufeff\nIn periods when interest rates are declining or remain at low levels, we may have to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower yielding instruments reducing our spread. Moreover, borrowers may prepay fixed-income securities, commercial mortgages and mortgage-backed securities in our general account in order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbates this risk. Lowering interest crediting rates helps to mitigate the effect of spread compression on some of our products. However, because we are entitled to reset the interest rates on our fixed-rate annuities only at limited, pre-established intervals, and since many of our contracts have guaranteed minimum interest or crediting rates, our spreads could still decrease. As of December 31, 2018, 41% of our annuities business, 80% of our retirement plan services business and 99% of our life insurance business with guaranteed minimum interest or crediting rates were at their guaranteed minimums.\n\ufeff\nOur expectation for future spreads is an important component in the amortization of DAC and value of business acquired (\u201cVOBA\u201d) as it affects the future profitability of the business. Currently, new money rates continue to be near historically low levels, although the Federal Reserve increased the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points four times during 2018 to a range of 2.25% to 2.50%. The Federal Reserve will monitor economic data closely to determine its next steps to changes in monetary policy. For additional information on interest rate risks, see \u201cPart II - Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk.\u201d\n\ufeff\nA decline in market interest rates could also reduce our return on investments that do not support particular policy obligations. During periods of sustained lower interest rates, our recorded policy liabilities may not be sufficient to meet future policy obligations and may need to be strengthened, thereby reducing net income in the affected reporting period. Accordingly, declining interest rates may materially affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and significantly reduce our profitability.\n\ufeff\nIncreases in market interest rates may also negatively affect our profitability. In periods of rapidly increasing interest rates, we may not be able to replace the assets in our general account with higher yielding assets needed to fund the higher crediting rates necessary to keep our interest-sensitive products competitive. We, therefore, may have to accept a lower spread and thus lower profitability or face a decline in sales and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. Increases in interest rates may cause increased surrenders and withdrawals of insurance products. In periods of increasing interest rates, policy loans and surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts may increase as contract holders seek to buy products with perceived higher returns. This process may lead to a flow of cash out of our businesses. These outflows may require investment assets to be sold at a time when the prices of those assets are lower because of the increase in market interest rates, which may result in realized investment losses. A sudden demand among consumers to change product types or withdraw funds could lead us to sell assets at a loss to meet the demand for funds. Furthermore, unanticipated increases in withdrawals and termination may cause us to unlock our DAC and VOBA assets, which would reduce net income. An increase in market interest rates could also have a material adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio, for example, by decreasing the estimated fair values of the fixed-income securities that comprise a substantial portion of our investment portfolio. An increase in interest rates could also result in decreased fee income associated with a decline in the value of variable annuity account balances invested in fixed-income funds.\n\ufeff\nBecause the equity markets and other factors impact the profitability and expected profitability of many of our products, changes in equity markets and other factors may significantly affect our business and profitability.\n\ufeff\nThe fee income that we earn on variable annuities is based primarily upon account values, and the fee income that we earn on VUL insurance policies is partially based upon account values. Because strong equity markets result in higher account values, strong equity markets positively affect our net income through increased fee income. Conversely, a weakening of the equity markets results in lower fee income and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and capital resources.\n\ufeff\nThe increased fee income resulting from strong equity markets increases the estimated gross profits (\u201cEGPs\u201d) from variable insurance products as do better than expected lapses, mortality rates and expenses. As a result, higher EGPs may result in lower net amortized costs related to DAC, deferred sales inducements (\u201cDSI\u201d), VOBA, deferred front-end loads (\u201cDFEL\u201d) and changes in future contract benefits. However, a decrease in the equity markets, as well as worse than expected increases in lapses, mortality rates and expenses, depending upon their significance, may result in higher net amortized costs associated with DAC, DSI, VOBA, DFEL and changes in future contract benefits and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and capital resources. If we had unlocked our reversion to the mean (\u201cRTM\u201d) assumption in the corridor as of December 31, 2018, we would have recorded unfavorable unlocking of approximately $25 million, pre-tax, for our Annuities segment and a favorable unlocking of approximately $70 million, pre-tax, for our Life Insurance segment and approximately $10 million, pre-tax, for our Retirement Plan Services segment. For further information about\nour RTM process, see \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates - DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL - Reversion to the Mean\u201d in the MD&A.\n\ufeff\nChanges in the equity markets, interest rates and/or volatility affect the profitability of our products with guaranteed benefits; therefore, such changes may have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability.\n\ufeff\nCertain of our variable annuity and fixed indexed annuity products include optional guaranteed benefit riders. These include GDB (variable annuity only), GWB and GIB riders. Our GWB, GIB and 4LATER\u00ae (a form of GIB rider) features have elements of both insurance benefits accounted for under the Financial Services - Insurance - Claim Costs and Liabilities for Future Policy Benefits Subtopic of the FASB ASC (\u201cbenefit reserves\u201d) and embedded derivatives accounted for under the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the FASB ASC (\u201cembedded derivative reserves\u201d). We calculate the value of the embedded derivative reserve and the benefit reserves based on the specific characteristics of each GLB feature. The amount of reserves related to GDB is related to the difference between the value of the underlying accounts and the GDB, calculated using a benefit ratio approach. The GDB reserves take into account the present value of total expected GDB payments, the present value of total expected GDB assessments over the life of the contract, claims paid to date and assessments to date. Reserves for our GIB and certain GWB with lifetime benefits are based on a combination of fair value of the underlying benefit and a benefit ratio approach. The benefit ratio approach takes into account, among other things, the present value of expected GIB payments, the present value of total expected GIB assessments over the life of the contract, claims paid to date and assessments to date. For variable annuities, the amount of reserves related to those GWB that do not have lifetime benefits is based on the fair value of the underlying benefit.\n\ufeff\nBoth the level of expected payments and expected total assessments used in calculating the benefit reserves are affected by the equity markets. The liabilities related to fair value are impacted by changes in equity markets, interest rates, volatility, foreign exchange rates and credit spreads. Accordingly, strong equity markets, increases in interest rates and decreases in volatility will generally decrease the reserves calculated using fair value. Conversely, a decrease in the equity markets along with a decrease in interest rates and an increase in volatility will generally result in an increase in the reserves calculated using fair value.\n\ufeff\nIncreases in reserves would result in a charge to our earnings in the quarter in which the increase occurs. Therefore, we maintain a customized dynamic hedge program that is designed to mitigate the risks associated with income volatility around the change in reserves on guaranteed benefits. However, the hedge positions may not be effective to exactly offset the changes in the carrying value of the guarantees due to, among other things, the time lag between changes in their values and corresponding changes in the hedge positions, high levels of volatility in the equity markets and derivatives markets, extreme swings in interest rates, contract holder behavior different than expected, a strategic decision to adjust the hedging strategy in reaction to extreme market conditions or inconsistencies between economic and statutory reserving guidelines and divergence between the performance of the underlying funds and hedging indices.\nIn addition, we remain liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event that derivative or reinsurance counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay, and we are also subject to the risk that the cost of hedging these guaranteed benefits increases, resulting in a reduction to net income. These, individually or collectively, may have a material adverse effect on net income, financial condition or liquidity.\n\ufeff\nLiquidity and Capital Position\n\ufeff\nAdverse capital and credit market conditions may affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital.\n\ufeff\nWe need liquidity to pay our operating expenses, interest on our debt and dividends on our capital stock, to maintain our securities lending activities and to replace certain maturing liabilities. Without sufficient liquidity, we will be forced to curtail our operations, and our business will suffer. When considering our liquidity and capital position, it is important to distinguish between the needs of our insurance subsidiaries and the needs of the holding company. For our insurance and other subsidiaries, the principal sources of liquidity are insurance premiums and fees, annuity considerations and cash flow from our investment portfolio and assets, consisting mainly of cash or assets that are readily convertible into cash.\n\ufeff\nIn the event that current resources do not satisfy our needs, we may have to seek additional financing. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn. Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. See \u201cReview of Consolidated Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow\u201d in the MD&A for a description of our credit ratings. Our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient, and in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all.\n\ufeff\nDisruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may also limit our access to capital required to operate our business, most significantly our insurance operations. Such market conditions may limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities; satisfy statutory capital requirements; generate fee income and market-related revenue to meet liquidity needs; and access the capital necessary to grow our business. As such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter term securities than we prefer or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and statutory capital position could be materially adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets.\nBecause we are a holding company with no direct operations, the inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us in sufficient amounts would harm our ability to meet our obligations.\n\ufeff\nWe are a holding company and we have no direct operations. Our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries. Our ability to meet our obligations for payment of interest and principal on outstanding debt obligations and to pay dividends to shareholders, repurchase our securities and pay corporate expenses depends primarily on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us. Under Indiana laws and regulations, our Indiana insurance subsidiaries, including our primary insurance subsidiary, LNL, may pay dividends to us without prior approval of the Indiana insurance commissioner (the \u201cCommissioner\u2019\u2019) only from unassigned surplus, or must receive prior approval of the Commissioner to pay a dividend if such dividend, along with all other dividends paid within the preceding 12 consecutive months, would exceed the statutory limitation. The current statutory limitation is the greater of 10% of the insurer\u2019s contract holders\u2019 surplus, as shown on its last annual statement on file with the Commissioner or the insurer\u2019s statutory net gain from operations for the previous 12 months, but in no event to exceed statutory unassigned surplus. LNL\u2019s subsidiaries, LLANY and LLACB, are bound by similar restrictions under the laws of New York and New Hampshire, respectively.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, payments of dividends and advances or repayment of funds to us by our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by the applicable laws of their respective jurisdictions requiring that our insurance subsidiaries hold a specified amount of minimum reserves in order to meet future obligations on their outstanding policies. These regulations specify that the minimum reserves shall be calculated to be sufficient to meet future obligations, after giving consideration to future required premiums to be received, and are based on certain specified mortality and morbidity tables, interest rates and methods of valuation, which are subject to change. In order to meet their claims-paying obligations, our insurance subsidiaries regularly monitor their reserves to ensure we hold sufficient amounts to cover actual or expected contract and claims payments. At times, we may determine that reserves in excess of the minimum may be needed to ensure sufficiency.\n\ufeff\nChanges in, or reinterpretations of, these laws can constrain the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses. Requiring our insurance subsidiaries to hold additional reserves has the potential to constrain their ability to pay dividends to the holding company. See \u201cLegislative, Regulatory and Tax - Attempts to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline 38 may fail in whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations\u201d above for additional information on potential changes in these laws.\n\ufeff\nThe earnings of our insurance subsidiaries impact contract holders\u2019 surplus. Lower earnings constrain the growth in our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 capital, and therefore, can constrain the payment of dividends and advances or repayment of funds to us.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, the amount of surplus that our insurance subsidiaries could pay as dividends is constrained by the amount of surplus they hold to maintain their financial strength ratings, to provide an additional layer of margin for risk protection and for future investment in our businesses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we believe that our insurance subsidiaries have sufficient liquidity to meet their contract holder obligations and maintain their operations.\n\ufeff\nA decrease in the capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries may result in a downgrade to our credit and insurer financial strength ratings.\n\ufeff\nIn any particular year, statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios may increase or decrease depending on a variety of factors, including the amount of statutory income or losses generated by our insurance subsidiaries (which itself is sensitive to equity market and credit market conditions), the amount of additional capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to support business growth, changes in reserving requirements, such as principles-based reserving, our inability to obtain reserve relief, changes in equity market levels, the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in our investment portfolio, the value of certain derivative instruments that do not get hedge accounting treatment, changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as changes to the NAIC RBC formulas. The RBC ratio is also affected by the product mix of the in-force book of business (i.e., the amount of business without guarantees is not subject to the same level of reserves as the business with guarantees). Most of these factors are outside of our control. Our credit and insurer financial strength ratings are significantly influenced by the statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios of our insurance company subsidiaries. The RBC ratio of LNL is an important factor in the determination of the credit and financial strength ratings of LNC and its subsidiaries. In addition, rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have the effect of increasing or decreasing the amount of statutory capital we must hold in order to maintain our current ratings. In extreme scenarios of equity market declines, the amount of additional statutory reserves that we are required to hold for our variable annuity guarantees may increase at a rate greater than the rate of change of the markets. Increases in reserves reduce the statutory surplus used in calculating our RBC ratios. To the extent that our statutory capital resources are deemed to be insufficient to maintain a particular rating by one or more rating agencies, we may seek to raise additional capital through public or private equity or debt financing, which may be on terms not as favorable as in the past.\n\ufeff\nAlternatively, if we were not to raise additional capital in such a scenario, either at our discretion or because we were unable to do so, our financial strength and credit ratings might be downgraded by one or more rating agencies. For more information on risks regarding our ratings, see \u201cCovenants and Ratings - A downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered and/or hurt our relationships with creditors\u201d below.\n\ufeff\nAn inability to access our credit facilities could result in a reduction in our liquidity and lead to downgrades in our credit and financial strength ratings.\n\ufeff\nWe have a $2.5 billion unsecured facility, which expires on June 30, 2021. We also have other facilities that we enter into in the ordinary course of business. See \u201cReview of Consolidated Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow - Financing Activities\u201d in the MD&A and Note 13.\n\ufeff\nWe rely on our credit facilities as a potential source of liquidity. We also use the credit facility as a potential backstop to provide variable annuity statutory reserve credit. While our variable annuity hedge assets available to provide reserve credit have normally exceeded the statutory reserves, in certain stressed market conditions, it is possible that these assets could be less than the statutory reserve. Our credit facility is available to provide reserve credit to LNL in such a case. If we were unable to access our facility in such circumstances, it could materially impact LNL\u2019s capital position. The availability of these facilities could be critical to our credit and financial strength ratings and our ability to meet our obligations as they come due in a market when alternative sources of credit are tight. The credit facilities contain certain administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We must comply with covenants under our credit facilities, including a requirement to maintain a specified minimum consolidated net worth.\n\ufeff\nOur right to borrow funds under these facilities is subject to the fulfillment of certain important conditions, including our compliance with all covenants, and our ability to borrow under these facilities is also subject to the continued willingness and ability of the lenders that are parties to the facilities to provide funds. Our failure to comply with the covenants in the credit facilities or fulfill the conditions to borrowings, or the failure of lenders to fund their lending commitments (whether due to insolvency, illiquidity or other reasons) in the amounts provided for under the terms of the facilities, would restrict our ability to access these credit facilities when needed and, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nAssumptions and Estimates\n\ufeff\nAs a result of changes in assumptions, estimates and methods in calculating reserves, our reserves for future policy benefits and claims related to our current and future business as well as businesses we may acquire in the future may prove to be inadequate.\n\ufeff\nWe establish and carry, as a liability, reserves based on estimates of how much we will need to pay for future benefits and claims. For our insurance products, we calculate these reserves based on many assumptions and estimates, including, but not limited to, estimated premiums we will receive over the assumed life of the policies, the timing of the events covered by the insurance policies, the lapse rate of the policies, the amount of benefits or claims to be paid and the investment returns on the assets we purchase with the premiums we receive.\n\ufeff\nThe sensitivity of our statutory reserves and surplus established for our variable annuity base contracts and riders to changes in the equity markets will vary depending on the magnitude of the decline. The sensitivity will be affected by the level of account values relative to the level of guaranteed amounts, product design and reinsurance. Statutory reserves for variable annuities depend upon the cumulative equity market impacts on the business in force, and therefore, result in non-linear relationships with respect to the level of equity market performance within any reporting period.\n\ufeff\nThe assumptions and estimates we use in connection with establishing and carrying our reserves are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amount or the timing of the payment of actual benefits and claims or whether the assets supporting the policy liabilities will grow to the level we assume prior to payment of benefits or claims. If our actual experience is different from our assumptions or estimates, our reserves may prove to be inadequate in relation to our estimated future benefits and claims. Increases in reserves have a negative effect on income from operations in the quarter incurred.\n\ufeff\nIf our businesses do not perform well and/or their estimated fair values decline or the price of our common stock does not increase, we may be required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill or to establish a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nGoodwill represents the excess of the acquisition price incurred to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets as of the date of acquisition. We test goodwill at least annually for indications of value impairment with consideration given to financial performance, mergers and acquisitions and other relevant factors. In addition, certain events, including a significant and adverse change in regulations, including tax law changes, legal factors, accounting standards or the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator or unanticipated competition, would cause us to review the carrying amounts of goodwill for impairment. Impairment testing is performed based upon estimates of the fair value of the \u201creporting unit\u201d to which the goodwill relates. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded goodwill impairment of $905 million related to our Life Insurance segment. Subsequent reviews of goodwill could result in an impairment of goodwill, and such write-downs could have a material adverse effect on our net income and book value, but will not affect the statutory capital of our insurance subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of $1.8 billion of goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For more information on goodwill, see \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d in the MD&A and Note 10.\n\ufeff\nDeferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by management to determine if they are realizable. As of December 31, 2018, we had a deferred tax asset of $1.2 billion. Factors in management\u2019s determination include the performance of the business, including the ability to generate capital gains from a variety of sources and tax planning strategies. If, based on available information, it is more likely than not that the deferred\nincome tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net income. Such valuation allowance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nThe determination of the amount of allowances and impairments taken on our investments is highly subjective and could materially impact our results of operations or financial condition.\n\ufeff\nThe determination of the amount of allowances and impairments varies by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in allowances and impairments in operations as such evaluations are revised. There can be no assurance that our management has accurately assessed the level of impairments taken and allowances reflected in our financial statements. Furthermore, additional impairments may need to be taken or allowances provided for in the future. Historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments or allowances.\nWe regularly review our fixed maturity available-for-sale (\u201cAFS\u201d) securities (also referred to as \u201cdebt securities\u201d) for declines in fair value that we determine to be other-than-temporary.\n\ufeff\nIf we intend to sell a debt security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell a debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis and the fair value of the debt security is below amortized cost, we conclude that an other-than-temporary impairment (\u201cOTTI\u201d) has occurred and the amortized cost is written down to current fair value, with a corresponding change to realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). If we do not intend to sell a debt security or it is not more likely than not we will be required to sell a debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis but the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost of the debt security (referred to as the credit loss), we conclude that an OTTI has occurred, and the amortized cost is written down to the estimated recovery value with a corresponding change to realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), as this is also deemed the credit portion of the OTTI. The remainder of the decline to fair value is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) (\u201cOCI\u201d) to unrealized OTTI on AFS securities on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders\u2019 Equity, as this is considered a noncredit (i.e., recoverable) impairment.\n\ufeff\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued amendments to the accounting guidance for measuring credit losses on financial instruments. For more information regarding the new accounting standard, see \u201cASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\u201d in Note 2.\n\ufeff\nRelated to our unrealized losses, we establish deferred tax assets for the tax benefit we may receive in the event that losses are realized. The realization of significant realized losses could result in an inability to recover the tax benefits and may result in the establishment of valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. Realized losses or impairments may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nOur valuation of fixed maturity, trading and equity securities may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions which are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\n\ufeff\nFixed maturity, trading and equity securities and short-term investments, which are reported at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, represented the majority of our total cash and invested assets. We have categorized these securities into a three-level hierarchy, based on the priority of the inputs to the respective valuation technique. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).\n\ufeff\nThe determination of fair values in the absence of quoted market prices is based on valuation methodologies, securities we deem to be comparable and assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances. The fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on available market information and judgments about financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or counterparty. Factors considered in estimating fair value include coupon rate, maturity, estimated duration, call provisions, sinking fund requirements, credit rating, industry sector of the issuer and quoted market prices of comparable securities. The use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.\n\ufeff\nDuring periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly increasing/decreasing or high/low interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain securities if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the current financial environment. In such cases, more securities may fall to Level 3 and thus require more subjectivity and management judgment. As such, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation, as well as valuation methods which are more sophisticated or require greater estimation, thereby resulting in values which may be less than the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\n\ufeff\nSignificant adverse mortality experience may result in the loss of, or higher prices for, reinsurance.\n\ufeff\nWe reinsure a significant amount of the mortality risk on fully underwritten, newly issued, individual life insurance contracts. We regularly review retention limits for continued appropriateness and they may be changed in the future. If we were to experience adverse mortality or morbidity experience, a significant portion of that would be reimbursed by our reinsurers. Prolonged or severe adverse\nmortality or morbidity experience could result in increased reinsurance costs, and ultimately, reinsurers being unwilling to offer coverage. If we are unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection at comparable rates to what we are paying currently, we may have to accept an increase in our net exposures or revise our pricing to reflect higher reinsurance premiums or both. If this were to occur, we may be exposed to reduced profitability and cash flow strain or we may not be able to price new business at competitive rates.\n\ufeff\nCatastrophes may adversely impact liabilities for contract holder claims.\n\ufeff\nOur insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality, such as a pandemic, an act of terrorism, natural disaster or other event that causes a large number of deaths or injuries. Significant influenza pandemics have occurred three times in the last century, but the likelihood, timing or severity of a future pandemic cannot be predicted. Additionally, the impact of climate change could cause changes in weather patterns, resulting in more severe and more frequent natural disasters such as forest fires, hurricanes, tornados, floods and storm surges. In our group insurance operations, a localized event that affects the workplace of one or more of our group insurance customers could cause a significant loss due to mortality or morbidity claims. These events could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any period and, depending on their severity, could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition.\n\ufeff\nThe extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Pandemics, natural disasters and man-made catastrophes, including terrorism, may produce significant damage in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. Claims resulting from natural or man-made catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition. Also, catastrophic events could harm the financial condition of our reinsurers and thereby increase the probability of default on reinsurance recoveries. Accordingly, our ability to write new business could also be affected.\n\ufeff\nConsistent with industry practice and accounting standards, we establish liabilities for claims arising from a catastrophe only after assessing the probable losses arising from the event. We cannot be certain that the liabilities we have established or applicable reinsurance will be adequate to cover actual claim liabilities, and a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nOperational Matters\n\ufeff\nOur enterprise risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could negatively affect our businesses or result in losses.\n\ufeff\nWe have devoted significant resources to develop our enterprise risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future. Nonetheless, our policies and procedures to identify, monitor and manage risks may not be fully effective. Many of our methods of managing risk and exposures are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior or statistics based on historical models. As a result, these methods may not predict future exposures, which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate, such as the risk of pandemics causing a large number of deaths. Other risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, clients, catastrophe occurrence or other matters that is publicly available or otherwise accessible to us, which may not always be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. Management of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective.\n\ufeff\nWe face risks of non-collectability of reinsurance and increased reinsurance rates, which could materially affect our results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe follow the insurance practice of reinsuring with other insurance and reinsurance companies a portion of the risks under the policies written by our insurance subsidiaries (known as \u201cceding\u201d). As of December 31, 2018, we ceded $667.9 billion of life insurance in force to reinsurers for reinsurance protection. Although reinsurance does not discharge our subsidiaries from their primary obligation to pay contract holders for losses insured under the policies we issue, reinsurance does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurance subsidiaries for the reinsured portion of the risk. As of December 31, 2018, we had $17.7 billion of reinsurance receivables from reinsurers for paid and unpaid losses, for which they are obligated to reimburse us under our reinsurance contracts. Of this amount, $12.1 billion related to reinsurance agreements entered into with Protective in May 2018, providing for the reinsurance and administration of the Liberty Life Business sold to Protective in connection with the Liberty acquisition. To support its obligations under the reinsurance agreements, Protective has established trust accounts for our benefit that fully collateralize the related reinsurance recoverable. In addition, $1.5 billion related to the sale of our reinsurance business to Swiss Re in 2001 through an indemnity reinsurance agreement. Swiss Re has funded a trust to support this business. The balance in the Swiss Re trust changes as a result of ongoing reinsurance activity and was $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2018. Furthermore, we hold trading securities to support the $177 million of funds withheld liabilities related to the Swiss Re treaties for which we would have the right of offset to the corresponding reinsurance receivables in the event of a default by Swiss Re. In addition, our Modco agreement with Athene resulted in a $7.5 billion deposit asset as of December 31, 2018, which is fully collateralized. For more information regarding reinsurance, see \u201cReinsurance\u201d in the MD&A and Note 9.\n\ufeff\nThe balance of the reinsurance is due from a diverse group of reinsurers. The collectability of reinsurance is largely a function of the solvency of the individual reinsurers. We perform annual credit reviews on our reinsurers, focusing on, among other things, financial capacity, stability, trends and commitment to the reinsurance business. We also require assets in trust, LOCs or other acceptable collateral to support balances due from reinsurers not authorized to transact business in the applicable jurisdictions. Despite these\nmeasures, a reinsurer\u2019s insolvency, inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance contract could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nReinsurers also may attempt to increase rates with respect to our existing reinsurance arrangements. The ability of our reinsurers to increase rates depends upon the terms of each reinsurance contract. Some of our reinsurance contracts contain provisions that limit the reinsurer\u2019s ability to increase rates on in-force business; however, some do not. An increase in reinsurance rates may affect the profitability of our insurance business. Additionally, such a rate increase could result in our recapture of the business, which may result in a need for additional reserves and increase our exposure to claims. While in recent years, we have faced a number of rate increase actions on in-force business, our management of those actions has not had a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. However, there can be no assurance that the outcome of future rate increase actions would similarly result in no material effect. See Note 14 for a description of reinsurance related actions.\n\ufeff\nCompetition for our employees is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business.\n\ufeff\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. Intense competition exists for the key employees with demonstrated ability, and we may be unable to hire or retain such employees. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations due to their skills, knowledge of our business, their years of industry experience and the potential difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement employees. We compete with other financial institutions primarily on the basis of our products, compensation, support services and financial condition. Sales in our businesses and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining key employees, including financial advisers, wholesalers and other employees, as well as independent distributors of our products.\n\ufeff\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims.\n\ufeff\nWe rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. Although we use a broad range of measures to protect our intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. We may have to litigate to enforce and protect our copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability, which represents a diversion of resources that may be significant in amount and may not prove successful. Additionally, complex legal and factual determinations and evolving laws and court interpretations make the scope of protection afforded our intellectual property uncertain, particularly in relation to our patents. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce the protection of our intellectual property assets could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete.\n\ufeff\nWe also may be subject to costly litigation in the event that another party alleges our operations or activities infringe upon another party\u2019s intellectual property rights. We may be subject to claims by third parties for breach of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or license usage rights. Any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant liability for damages. If we were found to have infringed a third-party patent or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial liability, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or utilizing and benefiting from certain copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses, or alternatively could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nOur information systems may experience interruptions, breaches in security and/or a failure of disaster recovery systems that could result in a loss or disclosure of confidential information, damage to our reputation and impairment of our ability to conduct business effectively.\n\ufeff\nOur information systems are critical to the operation of our business. We collect, process, maintain, retain and distribute large amounts of personal financial and health information and other confidential and sensitive data about our customers in the ordinary course of our business. Our business therefore depends on our customers\u2019 willingness to entrust us with their personal information. Any failure, interruption or breach in security could result in disruptions to our critical systems and adversely affect our customer relationships.\n\ufeff\nPublicly reported cyber-security threats and incidents have increased over recent periods. Although hackers have attempted and will likely continue to try to infiltrate our computer systems, to date, we have not had a material security breach. While we employ a robust and tested information security program, the preventative actions we take to reduce cyber incidents and protect our information technology may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyberattacks, compromised credentials, fraud, other security breaches or other unauthorized access to our computer systems, and, given the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks, in some cases, such incidents could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection. As a result, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it will be detected in a timely manner or that it can be sufficiently remediated. Such an occurrence may impede or interrupt our business operations and could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nIn the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, epidemic, industrial accident, blackout, computer virus, terrorist attack, cyberattack or war, unanticipated problems with our disaster recovery systems could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition, particularly if those problems affect our computer-based data processing, transmission, storage and retrieval systems and destroy valuable data. In addition, in the event that a significant number of our managers were unavailable following a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct business could be severely compromised. These interruptions also may interfere with our suppliers\u2019 ability to provide goods and services and our employees\u2019 ability to perform their job responsibilities.\nThe failure of our computer systems and/or our disaster recovery plans for any reason could cause significant interruptions in our operations and result in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data, including personal information relating to our customers. The occurrence of any such failure, interruption or security breach of our systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and financial liability. Depending on the nature of the information compromised, in the event of a data breach or other unauthorized access to our customer data, we may also have obligations to notify customers about the incident, and we may need to provide some form of remedy, such as a subscription to a credit monitoring service, for the individuals affected by the incident. For more information, see \u201cLegislative, Regulatory and Tax - State Regulation - Compliance with existing and emerging privacy regulations could result in increased compliance costs and/or lead to changes in business practices and policies, and any failure to protect the confidentiality of client information could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d\n\ufeff\nAlthough we conduct due diligence, negotiate contractual provisions and, in many cases, conduct periodic reviews of our vendors, distributors, and other third parties that provide operational or information technology services to us to confirm compliance with our information security standards, the failure of such third parties\u2019 computer systems and/or their disaster recovery plans for any reason might cause significant interruptions in our operations and result in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data, including personal information relating to our customers. Such a failure could harm our reputation, subject us to regulatory sanctions and legal claims, lead to a loss of customers and revenues and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results. While we maintain cyber liability insurance that provides both third-party liability and first party liability coverages, our insurance may not be sufficient to protect us against all losses.\n\ufeff\nAcquisitions of businesses, including our recent acquisition of LLACB, may not produce anticipated benefits resulting in operating difficulties, unforeseen liabilities or asset impairments, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nOur acquisition of LLACB was completed in May 2018, and our integration efforts are underway. Once completed however, an acquired business may not perform as projected, expense and revenue synergies may not materialize as expected and costs associated with the integration may be greater than anticipated. Our financial results could be adversely affected by unanticipated performance issues, unforeseen liabilities, transaction-related charges, diversion of management time and resources to acquisition integration challenges or growth strategies, loss of key employees or customers, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets or goodwill and indemnifications. Factors such as receiving the required governmental or regulatory approvals to merge the acquired entity, delays in implementation or completion of transition activities or a disruption to our or the acquired entity\u2019s business could impact our results.\n\ufeff\nCovenants and Ratings\n\ufeff\nA downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered and/or hurt our relationships with creditors.\n\ufeff\nNationally recognized rating agencies rate the financial strength of our principal insurance subsidiaries and rate our debt. Ratings are not recommendations to buy our securities. Each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically, and our current ratings may not be maintained in the future.\n\ufeff\nOur financial strength ratings, which are intended to measure our ability to meet contract holder obligations, are an important factor affecting public confidence in most of our products and, as a result, our competitiveness. A downgrade of the financial strength rating of one of our principal insurance subsidiaries could affect our competitive position in the insurance industry by making it more difficult for us to market our products, as potential customers may select companies with higher financial strength ratings, and by leading to increased withdrawals by current customers seeking companies with higher financial strength ratings. This could lead to a decrease in fees as net outflows of assets increase, and therefore, result in lower fee income. Furthermore, sales of assets to meet customer withdrawal demands could also result in losses, depending on market conditions. The interest rates we pay on our borrowings are largely dependent on our credit ratings. A downgrade of our debt ratings could affect our ability to raise additional debt, including bank lines of credit, with terms and conditions similar to our current debt, and accordingly, likely increase our cost of capital.\n\ufeff\nAll of our ratings and ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies, and therefore, no assurance can be given that our principal insurance subsidiaries or we can maintain these ratings. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Financial Strength Ratings\u201d and \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow\u201d in the MD&A for a description of our ratings.\n\ufeff\nWe will be required to pay interest on our capital securities with proceeds from the issuance of qualifying securities if we fail to achieve specified capital adequacy or net income and stockholders\u2019 equity levels.\n\ufeff\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $1.2 billion in principal amount of capital securities outstanding. All of the capital securities contain covenants that require us to make interest payments in accordance with an alternative coupon satisfaction mechanism (\u201cACSM\u201d) if we determine that one of the following triggers exists as of the 30th day prior to an interest payment date, or the \u201cdetermination date\u201d:\n\ufeff\n1. LNL\u2019s RBC ratio is less than 175% (based on the most recent annual financial statement filed with the State of Indiana); or\n\ufeff\n2. (i) The sum of our consolidated net income for the four trailing fiscal quarters ending on the quarter that is two quarters prior to the most recently completed quarter prior to the determination date is zero or negative, and (ii) our consolidated stockholders\u2019 equity (excluding accumulated OCI and any increase in stockholders\u2019 equity resulting from the issuance of preferred stock during a quarter), or \u201cadjusted stockholders\u2019 equity,\u201d as of (x) the most recently completed quarter and (y) the end of the quarter that is two quarters before the most recently completed quarter, has declined by 10% or more as compared to the quarter that is ten fiscal quarters prior to the last completed quarter, or the \u201cbenchmark quarter.\u201d\n\ufeff\nThe ACSM would generally require us to use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy our obligation to pay interest in full on the capital securities with the net proceeds from sales of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock with an exercise price greater than the market price. We would have to utilize the ACSM until the trigger events above no longer existed, and, in the case of test 2 above, until our adjusted stockholders\u2019 equity amount increased or declined by less than 10% as compared to the adjusted stockholders\u2019 equity at the end of the benchmark quarter for each interest payment date as to which interest payment restrictions were imposed by test 2 above.\n\ufeff\nIf we were required to utilize the ACSM and were successful in selling sufficient shares of common stock or warrants to satisfy the interest payment, we would dilute the current holders of our common stock. Furthermore, while a trigger event is occurring and if we do not pay accrued interest in full, we may not, among other things, pay dividends on or repurchase our capital stock. Our failure to pay interest pursuant to the ACSM will not result in an event of default with respect to the capital securities, nor will a nonpayment of interest, unless it lasts for ten consecutive years, although such breaches may result in monetary damages to the holders of the capital securities.\n\ufeff\nThe calculations of RBC, net income (loss) and adjusted stockholders\u2019 equity are subject to adjustments and the capital securities are subject to additional terms and conditions as further described in supplemental indentures filed as exhibits to our Forms 8-K filed on March 13, 2007, and May 17, 2006.\n\ufeff\nCertain blocks of our insurance business purchased from third-party insurers under indemnity reinsurance agreements may require us to place assets in trust, secure letters of credit or return the business, if the financial strength ratings and/or capital ratios of certain insurance subsidiaries are not maintained at specified levels.\n\ufeff\nUnder certain indemnity reinsurance agreements, two of our insurance subsidiaries, LNL and LLANY, provide 100% indemnity reinsurance for the business assumed; however, the third-party insurer, or the \u201ccedent,\u201d remains primarily liable on the underlying insurance business. Under these types of agreements, as of December 31, 2018, we held statutory reserves of $5.3 billion. These indemnity reinsurance arrangements require that our subsidiary, as the reinsurer, maintain certain insurer financial strength ratings and capital ratios. If these ratings or capital ratios are not maintained, depending upon the reinsurance agreement, the cedent may recapture the business, or require us to place assets in trust or provide LOCs at least equal to the relevant statutory reserves. Under the LNL reinsurance arrangement, we held approximately $3.2 billion of statutory reserves. LNL must maintain an A.M. Best financial strength rating of at least B++, an S&P financial strength rating of at least BBB- and a Moody\u2019s financial strength rating of at least Baa3. This arrangement may require LNL to place assets in trust equal to the relevant statutory reserves. Under LLANY\u2019s largest indemnity reinsurance arrangement, we held approximately $1.4 billion of statutory reserves as of December 31, 2018. LLANY must maintain an A.M. Best financial strength rating of at least B+, an S&P financial strength rating of at least BB+ and a Moody\u2019s financial strength rating of at least Ba1, as well as maintain an RBC ratio of at least 160% or an S&P capital adequacy ratio of 100%, or the cedent may recapture the business. Under two other LLANY arrangements, by which we established $715 million of statutory reserves, LLANY must maintain an A.M. Best financial strength rating of at least B++, an S&P financial strength rating of at least BBB- and a Moody\u2019s financial strength rating of at least Baa3. One of these arrangements also requires LLANY to maintain an RBC ratio of at least 185% or an S&P capital adequacy ratio of 115%. Each of these arrangements may require LLANY to place assets in trust equal to the relevant statutory reserves. As of December 31, 2018, LNL\u2019s and LLANY\u2019s RBC ratios exceeded the required ratio. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Financial Strength Ratings\u201d for a description of our financial strength ratings.\n\ufeff\nIf the cedent recaptured the business, LNL and LLANY would be required to release reserves and transfer assets to the cedent. Such a recapture could adversely impact our future profits. Alternatively, if LNL and LLANY established a security trust for the cedent, the ability to transfer assets out of the trust could be severely restricted, thus negatively impacting our liquidity.\n\ufeff\nInvestments\n\ufeff\nSome of our investments are relatively illiquid and are in asset classes that have been experiencing significant market valuation fluctuations.\n\ufeff\nWe hold certain investments that may lack liquidity, such as privately placed securities, mortgage loans, real estate, policy loans, limited partnership interests and other investments. These asset classes represented 28% of the carrying value of our total cash and invested assets as of December 31, 2018.\n\ufeff\nIf we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of normal cash requirements or are required to post or return collateral in connection with our investment portfolio, derivatives transactions or securities lending activities, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner, be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize, or both.\n\ufeff\nThe reported value of our relatively illiquid types of investments, our investments in the asset classes described in the paragraph above and, at times, our high quality, generally liquid asset classes, do not necessarily reflect the lowest current market price for the asset. If we were forced to sell certain of our assets in the current market, there can be no assurance that we would be able to sell them for the prices at which we have recorded them, and we might be forced to sell them at significantly lower prices.\n\ufeff\nWe invest a portion of our invested assets in investment funds, many of which make private equity investments. The amount and timing of income from such investment funds tends to be uneven as a result of the performance of the underlying investments, including private equity investments. The timing of distributions from the funds, which depends on particular events relating to the underlying investments, as well as the funds\u2019 schedules for making distributions and their needs for cash, can be difficult to predict. As a result, the amount of income that we record from these investments can vary substantially from quarter to quarter.\n\ufeff\nDefaults on our mortgage loans and write-downs of mortgage equity may adversely affect our profitability.\n\ufeff\nOur mortgage loans face default risk and are principally collateralized by commercial properties. The performance of our mortgage loan investments may fluctuate in the future. In addition, some of our mortgage loan investments have balloon payment maturities. An increase in the default rate of our mortgage loan investments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, any geographic or sector exposure in our mortgage loans may have adverse effects on our investment portfolios and consequently on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. While we seek to mitigate this risk by having a broadly diversified portfolio, events or developments that have a negative effect on any particular geographic region or sector may have a greater adverse effect on the investment portfolios to the extent that the portfolios are exposed.\n\ufeff\nThe difficulties faced by other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\n\ufeff\nWe have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks and other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. In addition, with respect to secured transactions, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the related loan or derivative exposure. We also may have exposure to these financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt instruments, derivative transactions and/or equity investments. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, downturns in the economy or real estate values, operational failure, corporate governance issues or other reasons. A downturn in the U.S. or other economies could result in increased impairments. There can be no assurance that any such losses or impairments to the carrying value of these assets would not materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nOur requirements to post collateral or make payments related to declines in market value of specified assets may adversely affect our liquidity and expose us to counterparty credit risk.\n\ufeff\nMany of our transactions with financial and other institutions, including settling futures positions, specify the circumstances under which the parties are required to post collateral. The amount of collateral we may be required to post under these agreements may increase under certain circumstances, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, under the terms of some of our transactions, we may be required to make payments to our counterparties related to any decline in the market value of the specified assets.\n\ufeff\nOur investments are reflected within our consolidated financial statements utilizing different accounting bases, and, accordingly, there may be significant differences between cost and fair value that are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nOur principal investments are in fixed maturity and equity securities, mortgage loans on real estate, policy loans, short-term investments, derivative instruments, limited partnerships and other invested assets. The carrying value of such investments is as follows:\n\u00b7\nFixed maturity securities are classified as AFS, except for those designated as trading securities, and are reported at their estimated fair value. The difference between the estimated fair value and amortized cost of such securities (i.e., unrealized investment gains and losses) is recorded as a separate component of OCI, net of adjustments to DAC, contract holder related amounts and deferred income taxes;\n\u00b7\nFixed maturity securities designated as trading securities and equity securities are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in realized gain (loss). However, in certain cases, the trading and equity securities support reinsurance arrangements. In those cases, offsetting the changes to fair value of the trading and equity securities are corresponding changes in\nthe fair value of the embedded derivative liability associated with the underlying reinsurance arrangement. In other words, the investment results for the trading and equity securities, including gains and losses from sales, are passed directly to the reinsurers through the contractual terms of the reinsurance arrangements. These types of securities represent 48% of our trading and equity securities;\n\u00b7\nShort-term investments include investments with remaining maturities of one year or less, but greater than three months, at the time of acquisition and are stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair value;\n\u00b7\nAlso, mortgage loans on real estate are carried at unpaid principal balances, adjusted for any unamortized premiums or discounts and deferred fees or expenses, net of valuation allowances;\n\u00b7\nPolicy loans are carried at unpaid principal balances;\n\u00b7\nReal estate joint ventures and other limited partnership interests are carried using the equity method of accounting; and\n\u00b7\nOther invested assets consist principally of derivatives with positive fair values. Derivatives are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in income from non-qualifying derivatives and derivatives in fair value hedging relationships. Derivatives in cash flow hedging relationships are reflected as a separate component of OCI.\n\ufeff\nInvestments not carried at fair value on our consolidated financial statements, principally, mortgage loans, policy loans and real estate, may have fair values that are substantially higher or lower than the carrying value reflected on our consolidated financial statements. In addition, unrealized losses are not reflected in net income unless we realize the losses by either selling the security at below amortized cost or determine that the decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary (i.e., impaired). Each of such asset classes is regularly evaluated for impairment under the accounting guidance appropriate to the respective asset class.\n\ufeff\nCompetition\n\ufeff\nIntense competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability.\n\ufeff\nOur businesses are intensely competitive. We compete based on a number of factors, including name recognition, service, the quality of investment advice, investment performance, product features, price, perceived financial strength and claims-paying and credit ratings. Our competitors include insurers, broker-dealers, investment advisers, asset managers, hedge funds and other financial institutions. A number of our business units face competitors that have greater market share, offer a broader range of products or have higher financial strength or credit ratings than we do.\n\ufeff\nIn recent years, there has been consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry resulting in increased competition from large, well-capitalized financial services firms. Many of these firms also have been able to increase their distribution systems through mergers or contractual arrangements. Furthermore, larger competitors may have lower operating costs and an ability to absorb greater risk while maintaining their financial strength ratings, thereby allowing them to price their products more competitively.\n\ufeff\nOur sales representatives are not captive and may sell products of our competitors.\n\ufeff\nWe sell our annuity and life insurance products through independent sales representatives. These representatives are not captive, which means they may also sell our competitors\u2019 products. If our competitors offer products that are more attractive than ours, or pay higher commission rates to the sales representatives than we do, these representatives may concentrate their efforts in selling our competitors\u2019 products instead of ours.\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 49015, "SIC": 6311, "TIC": "LNC"}
