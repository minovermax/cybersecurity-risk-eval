RISK FACTORS\nPopular, like other financial institutions, faces a number of risks inherent to our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.\nThe risks described in this report are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known by us or that we currently deem to be immaterial, or that are generally applicable to all financial institutions, also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND OUR INDUSTRY\nA significant portion of our business is concentrated in Puerto Rico, where a prolonged economic recession and a current fiscal crisis has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact us.\nA significant portion of our financial activities and credit exposure is concentrated in Puerto Rico, which entered into recession in the second quarter of 2006. Puerto Rico\u2019s gross national product contracted in real terms every year except one between fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2014 (inclusive), despite a large amount of governmental stimulus and deficit spending in several of those fiscal years. Gross national product is projected to further contract for fiscal years 2015 and 2016. In addition, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (the \u201cCommonwealth\u201d) is experiencing a severe fiscal crisis resulting from persistent and significant budget deficits, a high debt burden, the continuing economic contraction and lack of access to the capital markets, among other factors. The public debt of the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities has been assigned below investment grade ratings since February 2014 and the Commonwealth is operating with very limited liquidity. The Commonwealth\u2019s ability to finance future budget deficits is expected to be very limited, if any.\nIn order to confront its liquidity constraints and budget shortfalls, while continuing to provide essential services and comply with constitutional obligations for the payment of general obligation bonds, the Government has been forced to implement certain extraordinary measures, which include delaying the payment of third-party payables and income tax refunds. Some of these measures are unsustainable and have significant negative economic effects. Also, these measures are insufficient to address the current fiscal crisis and the Commonwealth has indicated that it will not have sufficient liquidity before the end of fiscal year 2016 (ending on June 30, 2016) to meet all of its debt service obligations while continuing to provide essential services to the residents of Puerto Rico.\nThe Commonwealth has developed a plan that proposes various measures to address its fiscal crisis. These measures, some of which are subject to legal and political implementation risk and can also result in further significant negative economic effects, include additional revenue raising and expense reduction measures, and a broad based restructuring of the public debt of the Commonwealth and various public corporations. Given the unprecedented scope and complexity of the proposed restructuring, there can be no assurance that the Commonwealth will be able to consummate its proposal. In the meantime, the United States Congress is considering various proposals to assist Puerto Rico in addressing its fiscal crisis, including the establishment of a Federal fiscal control board and providing broad based restructuring authority.\nThe credit quality of BPPR\u2019s loan portfolio necessarily reflects, among other things, the general economic conditions in Puerto Rico and other adverse conditions affecting Puerto Rico consumers and businesses. The effects of the prolonged recession are reflected in limited loan demand, an increase in the rate of foreclosures and delinquencies on loans granted in Puerto Rico. In addition, the measures taken to address the fiscal crisis and those that may have to be taken in the near future, including higher taxes, will likely affect many of our individual customers and customers\u2019 businesses, which could cause credit losses that adversely affect us. Furthermore, the continued recession and measures taken to address the fiscal crisis may negatively affect consumer confidence, which would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these conditions and cause decreased borrowings, either due to reduced demand or reductions in the borrowing base available for customer loans. Any reduction in consumer spending as a result of these issues may also adversely impact our interest and non-interest revenues.\nIf global or local economic conditions worsen or the Government of Puerto Rico is unable to manage its fiscal crisis, including consummating an orderly restructuring of its debt obligations while continuing to provide essential services, those adverse effects could continue or worsen in ways that we are not able to predict and that are outside of our control. Under such circumstances, we could experience an increase in the level of provision for loan losses, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and reserve for credit losses. All of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and financial condition.\nThe Corporation\u2019s assets and revenue composition by geographical area and by business segment reporting are presented in Note 44 to the consolidated financial statements. For additional information regarding the Puerto Rico economy and the current fiscal crisis, refer to \u201cGeographic and government risk\u201d in the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of the Annual Report.\nFurther deterioration in collateral values of properties securing our construction, commercial and mortgage loan portfolios would result in increased credit losses and continue to harm our results of operations.\nFurther deterioration of the value of real estate collateral securing our construction, commercial and mortgage loan portfolios would result in increased credit losses. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 3%, 29% and 32% of our non-covered loan portfolio consisted of construction loans, commercial loans secured by real estate and mortgage loans, respectively.\nSubstantially our entire loan portfolio is located within the boundaries of the U.S. economy. Whether the collateral is located in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the British Virgin Islands or the U.S. mainland, the performance of our loan portfolio and the collateral value backing the transactions are dependent upon the performance of and conditions within each specific real estate market. Recent economic reports related to the real estate market in Puerto Rico indicate that several sectors of the real estate market are subject to reductions in value related to general economic conditions. We measure loan impairment based on the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent, which is derived from estimated collateral values, principally obtained from appraisal reports that take into consideration prices in observed transactions involving similar assets in similar locations, size and supply and demand. An appraisal report is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made. If the appraisal does not reflect the amount that may be obtained upon any sale or foreclosure of the property, we may not realize an amount equal to the indebtedness secured by the property. In addition, given the current slowdown in the real estate market in Puerto Rico, the properties securing these loans may be difficult to dispose of, if foreclosed.\nConstruction and commercial loans, mostly secured by commercial and residential real estate properties, entail a higher credit risk than consumer and residential mortgage loans, since they are larger in size, may have less collateral coverage, concentrate more risk in a single borrower and are generally more sensitive to economic downturns. As of December 31, 2015, non-covered commercial and construction loans secured by commercial real estate properties, amounted to $ 7.3 billion or 32% of the total non-covered loan portfolio.\nBPPR has various subsidiaries holding specific assets acquired in satisfaction of loans for real estate development projects. Total non-covered assets of those subsidiaries amounted to $48.6 million as of December 31, 2015, of which $2.4 million or 5% of total non-covered assets are foreclosed properties.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, net charge-offs specifically related to values of properties securing our non-covered construction, commercial and mortgage loan portfolios totaled $ 4.5 million, $ 60.0 million and $ 10.0 million, respectively. Continued deterioration of the fair value of real estate properties for collateral dependent impaired loans would require increases in our provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses. Any such increase would have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations. For more information on the credit quality of our construction, commercial and mortgage portfolio, see the Credit Risk Management and Loan Quality section of the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Annual Report.\nDifficult market conditions have adversely affected the financial industry and our results of operations and financial condition.\nDuring the financial crisis that commenced in 2008, market instability and lack of investor confidence led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce or cease providing funding to borrowers, including other financial institutions. This led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack of consumer confidence, increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity in general. The resulting economic pressures on consumers and uncertainty about the financial markets adversely affected our industry and our business, results of operations and financial condition. The increased regulation of our industry, including as a result of the EESA and the Dodd-Frank Act and the creation of the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, may increase our compliance costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. The lingering effects of these circumstances have continued to affect our business. A re-occurrence of these difficult conditions would exacerbate the economic challenges facing us and others in the financial industry.\nLegislative and regulatory reforms may have a significant impact on our business and results of operations.\nPopular is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal, New York and Puerto Rico banking authorities. Any change in applicable federal, New York or Puerto Rico laws or regulations could have a substantial impact on our operations. Additional laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted in the future that could significantly affect Popular\u2019s powers, authority and operations, which could have a material adverse effect on Popular\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Further, regulators in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties, have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe and unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies. The exercise of this regulatory discretion and power could have a negative impact on Popular.\nIn 2008, responding to what has been commonly referred to as the financial crisis, government regulatory agencies and political bodies began placing increased focus and scrutiny on the financial services industry. The U.S. Government intervened on an unprecedented scale. Several funding and capital programs by the Federal Reserve Board and the U.S. Treasury were launched in 2008 and 2009, with the objective of enhancing financial institutions\u2019 ability to raise liquidity. These programs had the effect of increasing the degree or nature of regulatory supervision to which we are subjected. These and other potential regulation and scrutiny may, or proposed legislative and regulatory changes could, significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital and, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations or earnings.\nIn an effort to address the Commonwealth\u2019s ongoing fiscal problems, the Government has enacted tax reform in the past and is expected to do so in the future. In 2014, the Government of Puerto Rico approved an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code, which, among other things, changed the income tax rate for capital gains from 15% to 20%. As a result, the Corporation recognized an income tax expense of approximately $20.0 million during 2014. In addition, in May 2015, the Government approved an increase in the sales and use tax rate, effective July 1, 2015, from 7% to 11.5%, expanded the sales and use tax to certain business-to-business services that were previously exempt, and provided for a transition to a value-added tax expected to become effective on April 1, 2016. Legislative changes, particularly changes in tax laws, could adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act imposes new capital requirements, assessments and restrictions on our businesses, impacting the profitability of our business activities and changing certain of our business practices, and could expose us to additional costs, including increased compliance costs.\nOn July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law, which significantly changes the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions affecting large and small financial institutions alike, including several provisions that will affect how community banks, thrifts, and small bank and thrift holding companies will be regulated in the future.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, imposes new capital requirements on bank holding companies; changes the base for FDIC insurance assessments to a bank\u2019s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, rather than upon its deposit base, permanently raises the standard deposit insurance limit to $250,000; and expands the FDIC\u2019s authority to raise insurance premiums. The legislation also calls for the FDIC to raise the ratio of reserves to deposits from 1.15% to 1.35% for deposit insurance purposes by September 30, 2020 and to \u201coffset the effect\u201d of increased assessments on insured depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion. The Dodd-Frank Act also limits interchange fees payable on debit card transactions, establishes the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as an independent entity within the Federal Reserve, which has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards, and contains provisions on mortgage-related matters such as steering incentives, determinations as to a borrower\u2019s ability to repay and prepayment penalties. The Dodd-Frank Act also includes provisions that affect corporate governance and executive compensation at all publicly-traded companies and allows financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts. The legislation also restricts proprietary trading, places restrictions on the owning or sponsoring of hedge funds and private equity funds, and regulates the derivatives activities of banks and their affiliates.\nThese provisions, or any other aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to the financial industry, if enacted or adopted, may impact the profitability of our business activities or change certain of our business practices, including the ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans, and achieve satisfactory interest spreads, and could expose us to additional costs, including increased compliance costs. These changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations in order to comply, and could therefore also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual funds, hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. There can be no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings.\nWe have procedures in place to mitigate the impact of a default among our counterparties. We request collateral for most credit exposures with other financial institutions and monitor these on a regular basis. Nonetheless, market volatility could impact the valuation of collateral held by us and result in losses.\nOur ability to raise financing is dependent in part on market confidence. In times when market confidence is affected by events related to well-known financial institutions, risk aversion among participants may increase substantially and make it more difficult for us to borrow in the credit or capital markets.\nWe are subject to risk related to our own credit rating.\nThe Corporation\u2019s banking subsidiaries currently do not use borrowings that are rated by the major rating agencies, as these banking subsidiaries are funded primarily with deposits and secured borrowings. At December 31, 2015, the banking subsidiaries had $20 million in deposits that were subject to rating triggers.\nSome of the Corporation\u2019s derivative instruments include financial covenants tied to the bank\u2019s well-capitalized status and certain formal regulatory actions. These agreements could require exposure collateralization, early termination or both. The fair value of derivative instruments in a liability position subject to financial covenants approximated $4 million at December 31, 2015, with the Corporation providing collateral totaling $10 million to cover the net liability position with counterparties on these derivative instruments.\nIn addition, certain mortgage servicing and custodial agreements that BPPR has with third parties include rating covenants. In the event of a credit rating downgrade, the third parties have the right to require the institution to engage a substitute cash custodian for escrow deposits and/or increase collateral levels securing the recourse obligations. Also, the Corporation services residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions. Certain contractual agreements require the Corporation to post collateral to secure such recourse obligations if the institution\u2019s required credit ratings are not maintained. Collateral pledged by the Corporation to secure recourse obligations amounted to approximately $81 million at December 31, 2015. The Corporation could be required to post additional collateral under the agreements. Management expects that it would be able to meet additional collateral requirements if and when needed. The requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of escrow deposits could reduce the Corporation\u2019s liquidity resources and impact its operating results.\nOur credit ratings were reduced substantially in 2009, and our senior unsecured ratings are now \u201cnon-investment grade\u201d with the three major rating agencies. This may make it more difficult for the Corporation and its subsidiaries to borrow in the capital markets and at a higher cost.\nWe are subject to default risk in our loan portfolio.\nWe are subject to the risk of loss from loan defaults and foreclosures with respect to the loans originated or acquired. We establish provisions for loan losses, which lead to reductions in the income from operations, in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level which is deemed appropriate by management based upon an assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio in accordance with established procedures and guidelines. This process, which is critical to our financial results and condition, requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of economic and market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay the loans. There can be no assurance that management has accurately estimated the level of future loan losses or that Popular will not have to increase the provision for loan losses in the future as a result of future increases in non-performing loans or for other reasons beyond our control. Any such increases in our\nprovisions for loan losses or any loan losses in excess of our provisions for loan losses would have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and result of operations. We will continue to evaluate our provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses and may be required to increase such amounts.\nThe Government of Puerto Rico\u2019s current fiscal crisis has affected and could continue to affect the value of our loans to the Government and our portfolio of Puerto Rico Government securities.\nWe have direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government, its public corporations and municipalities that amounted to $669 million, of which approximately $578 million is outstanding, at December 31, 2015. Of the amount outstanding, $502 million consists of loans and $76 million are securities. Obligations from various municipalities in Puerto Rico for which, in most cases, the good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power of the applicable municipality has been pledged to their repayment, amounted to $502 million at December 31, 2015. Although the obligations of Puerto Rico\u2019s municipalities are not included in the debt restructuring proposed by the Government, the municipalities could nonetheless be affected by general economic conditions if the Government of Puerto Rico is unable to manage its fiscal crisis. Furthermore, as part of various measures to address its limited liquidity and fiscal crisis, the Government may take measures that have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the municipalities.\nWe also have indirect exposure to loans or securities that are payable by non-governmental entities, but which carry a government guarantee to cover any shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower default, which amounted to $394 million at December 31, 2015. These included $316 million in residential mortgage loans that are guaranteed by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority. These mortgage loans are secured by the underlying properties and the guarantees serve to cover shortfalls in collateral in the event of a borrower default. Also, the Corporation had $50 million in Puerto Rico pass-through housing bonds backed by FNMA, GNMA or residential loans CMO\u2019s, and $28 million of commercial real estate notes.\nIn February 2014, the three principal rating agencies (Moody\u2019s, S&P and Fitch) lowered their ratings on the General Obligation bonds of the Commonwealth and the bonds of several other Commonwealth instrumentalities to non-investment grade ratings. In connection with their rating actions, the rating agencies noted various factors, including high levels of public debt, the lack of a clear economic growth catalysts, recurring fiscal budget deficits, the financial condition of the public sector employee pension plans and, more recently, liquidity concerns regarding the Commonwealth and its ability to access the capital markets. During 2015, the rating agencies further downgraded the debt ratings of the Commonwealth general obligation bonds and of various public instrumentalities to categories that reflect high vulnerability to non-payment and the expectation of the rating agencies of defaults in such obligations.\nFurther deterioration in the fiscal situation, with possible further negative ratings implications, could further adversely affect the value of our Puerto Rico government obligations, resulting in losses to us.\nWe are exposed to credit risk from mortgage loans that have been sold or are being serviced subject to recourse arrangements.\nPopular is generally at risk for mortgage loan defaults from the time it funds a loan until the time the loan is sold or securitized into a mortgage-backed security. In the past, we have retained, through recourse arrangements, part of the credit risk on sales of mortgage loans, and we also service certain mortgage loan portfolios with recourse. At December 31, 2015, we serviced $1.9 billion in residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions, principally loans associated with FNMA and Freddie Mac programs. In the event of any customer default, pursuant to the credit recourse provided, we are required to repurchase the loan or reimburse the third party investor for the incurred loss. The maximum potential amount of future payments that we would be required to make under the recourse arrangements in the event of nonperformance by the borrowers is equivalent to the total outstanding balance of the residential mortgage loans serviced with recourse and interest, if applicable. During 2015, we repurchased approximately $ 59 million in mortgage loans subject to the credit recourse provisions. In the event of nonperformance by the borrower, we have rights to the underlying collateral securing the mortgage loan. As of December 31, 2015, our liability established to cover the estimated credit loss exposure related to loans sold or serviced with credit recourse amounted to $ 59 million. We may suffer losses on these loans when the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage loan are less than the outstanding principal balance of the loan plus any uncollected interest advanced and the costs of holding and disposing of the related property.\nDefective and repurchased loans may harm our business and financial condition.\nIn connection with the sale and securitization of loans, we are required to make a variety of customary representations and warranties regarding Popular and the loans being sold or securitized. Our obligations with respect to these representations and warranties are generally outstanding for the life of the loan, and they relate to, among other things:\n\u2022\ncompliance with laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nunderwriting standards;\n\u2022\nthe accuracy of information in the loan documents and loan file; and\n\u2022\nthe characteristics and enforceability of the loan.\nA loan that does not comply with these representations and warranties may take longer to sell, may impact our ability to obtain third party financing for the loan, and be unsalable or salable only at a significant discount. If such a loan is sold before we detect non-compliance, we may be obligated to repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly, or we may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any loss, either of which could reduce our cash available for operations and liquidity. Management believes that it has established controls to ensure that loans are originated in accordance with the secondary market\u2019s requirements, but mistakes may be made, or certain employees may deliberately violate our lending policies. We seek to minimize repurchases and losses from defective loans by correcting flaws, if possible, and selling or re-selling such loans. We have established specific reserves for probable losses related to repurchases resulting from representations and warranty violations on specific portfolios. At December 31, 2015, Popular\u2019s reserve for estimated losses from representation and warranty arrangements amounted to $ 13 million, which was included as part of other liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial condition. Nonetheless, we do not expect any such losses to be significant, although if they were to occur, they would adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition.\nIncreases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nWith the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, major changes were introduced to the FDIC deposit insurance system. Under the Dodd- Frank Act, the FDIC now has until the end of September 2020 to bring its reserve ratio to the new statutory minimum of 1.35%. New rules amending the deposit insurance assessment regulations under the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act have been adopted, including a final rule designating 2% as the designated reserve ratio and a final rule extending temporary unlimited deposit insurance to non-interest bearing transaction accounts maintained in connection with lawyers\u2019 trust accounts. On February 7, 2011, the FDIC adopted regulations effective for the 2011 second quarter assessment and payable in September 2011, which outline significant changes in the risk-based premiums approach for banks with over $10 billion of assets and creates a \u201cScorecard\u201d system. The \u201cScorecard\u201d system uses a performance score and loss severity score, which aggregate to an initial base assessment rate. The assessment base also changed from deposits to an institution\u2019s average total assets minus its average tangible equity. For 2015, the FDIC deposit insurance expense of Popular totaled $28 million. In October 2015, the FDIC proposed to impose a surcharge on the quarterly assessments of insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. This would result in increased costs for BPPR. Because of the uncertainty as to the outcome of the FDIC\u2019s proposal, we cannot provide any assurance as to the ultimate impact of any surcharges on the amount of deposit insurance expense reported in future periods.\nWe are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures, our level of non-performing assets increase, or our risk profile changes or our capital position is impaired, we may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums than the recently increased levels. Any future increases or special assessments may materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, it may adversely affect our financial condition and future results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $626 million and $52 million of goodwill and amortizable intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet related to our Puerto Rico and United States operations. If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. Under GAAP, we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of the goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in the industry.\nThe goodwill impairment evaluation process requires us to make estimates and assumptions with regards to the fair value of our reporting units. Actual values may differ significantly from these estimates. Such differences could result in future impairment of goodwill that would, in turn, negatively impact our results of operations and the reporting unit where the goodwill is recorded. Critical assumptions that are used as part of these evaluations include:\n\u2022\nselection of comparable publicly traded companies, based on nature of business, location and size;\n\u2022\nselection of comparable acquisition and capital raising transactions;\n\u2022\nthe discount rate applied to future earnings, based on an estimate of the cost of equity;\n\u2022\nthe potential future earnings of the reporting unit; and\n\u2022\nthe market growth and new business assumptions.\nWe conducted our annual evaluation of goodwill during the third quarter of 2015 using July 31, 2015 as the annual evaluation date. This evaluation is a two- step process. For the BPPR reporting unit, the average estimated fair value calculated in Step 1 using all valuation methodologies exceeded BPPR\u2019s equity value by approximately $180 million in the July 31, 2015 annual test. For BPNA reporting unit, the average estimated fair value calculated in Step 1 using all valuation methodologies exceeded BPNA\u2019s equity value by approximately $92 million in the July 31, 2015 annual test. Accordingly, there was no indication of impairment on the goodwill recorded in BPPR or BPNA at July 31, 2015 and there was no need for a Step 2 analysis.\nManagement monitors events or changes in circumstances between annual tests to determine if these events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. There has been a significant decline in the Corporation\u2019s stock price during the fourth quarter of 2015, attributed to macro economic conditions in the global markets as well as the continued weakness in the Puerto Rico economy. This represented a triggering event which required management to conduct a goodwill impairment analysis as of December 31, 2015. The Corporation used the same methodology as for the annual impairment test, including a reconciliation of the aggregate fair values determined for the reporting units to the market capitalization of Popular, Inc.\nFor the BPNA reporting unit, the average estimated fair value calculated in Step 1 using all valuation methodologies was below BPNA\u2019s equity value by approximately $171 million in the December 31, 2015 test. Accordingly, management proceeded to perform the Step 2 analysis. The Corporation performed a valuation of all assets and liabilities of BPNA, including any recognized and unrecognized intangible assets, to determine the fair value of BPNA\u2019s net assets. To complete Step 2, the Corporation subtracted from BPNA\u2019s Step 1 fair value the determined fair value of the net assets to arrive at the implied fair value of goodwill. The results of Step 2 indicated that the implied fair value of goodwill exceeded the goodwill carrying value by $197 million resulting in no goodwill impairment.\nFor the BPPR reporting unit, the average estimated fair value calculated in Step 1 using all valuation methodologies exceeded BPPR\u2019s equity value by approximately $313 million in the December 31, 2015 test. This result indicates there is no indication of impairment on the goodwill recorded in BPPR at December 31, 2015 and there is no need for a Step 2 analysis.\nFurther declines in the Corporation\u2019s stock price, related to macroeconomic conditions in the global market as well as the weakness in the Puerto Rico economy may lead to an impairment of goodwill.\nIf we are required to record a charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements because an impairment of the goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur compensation practices are subject to oversight by applicable regulators.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain key senior leaders, and competition for such senior leaders can be intense in most areas of our business. Our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve Board. We also may be subject to limitations on compensation practices by the FDIC or other regulators, which may or may not affect our competitors.\nThe Federal Reserve Board reviews, as part of its regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation agreements of banking organizations that are not \u201clarge, complex banking organizations\u201d. These reviews are tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization\u2019s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of this supervisory initiative are included in reports of examination. Deficiencies are incorporated into the organization\u2019s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization\u2019s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization\u2019s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. In April 2011, the Federal Reserve Board, other federal banking agencies and the SEC jointly published proposed rules designed to implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act prohibiting incentive compensation arrangements that would encourage inappropriate risk taking at covered financial institutions,\nwhich includes a bank or bank holding company with $1 billion or more of assets, such as Popular, PNA, BPPR and BPNA. Although final rules have not been adopted as of February 2016, officials from the Federal Reserve Board have recently indicated that the U.S. banking regulators are in the process of preparing for public comment a new rule on incentive compensation. It cannot be determined at this time whether or when a final rule will be adopted and whether compliance with such a final rule will substantially affect the manner in which we structure compensation for our executives and other employees.\nThe scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators\u2019 policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the near future. It cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect the ability of Popular and our subsidiaries to hire, retain and motivate key employees. Limitations on our compensation practices could have a negative impact on our ability to attract and retain talented senior leaders in support of our long-term strategy.\nAs a holding company, we depend on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries for liquidity.\nWe are a bank holding company and depend primarily on dividends from our banking and other operating subsidiaries to fund our cash needs. These obligations and needs include capitalizing subsidiaries, repaying maturing debt and paying debt service on outstanding debt. Our banking subsidiaries, BPPR and BPNA, are limited by law in their ability to make dividend payments and other distributions to us based on their earnings and capital position. In addition, based on its current financial condition, BPNA may not declare or pay a dividend without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board and the NYSDFS. A failure by our banking subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow to make dividend payments to us may have a negative impact on our results of operation and financial position. Also, a failure by the bank holding company to access sufficient liquidity resources to meet all projected cash needs in the ordinary course of business may have a detrimental impact on our financial condition and ability to compete in the market.\nActions by the rating agencies or having capital levels below well-capitalized could raise the cost of our obligations, which could affect our ability to borrow or to enter into hedging agreements in the future and may have other adverse effects on our business.\nActions by the rating agencies could raise the cost of our borrowings since lower rated securities are usually required by the market to pay higher rates than obligations of higher credit quality.\nThe market for non-investment grade securities is much smaller and less liquid than for investment grade securities. Therefore, if we were to attempt to issue preferred stock or debt securities into the capital markets, it is possible that there would not be sufficient demand to complete a transaction and the cost could be substantially higher than for more highly rated securities.\nIn addition, changes in our ratings and capital levels below well-capitalized could affect our relationships with some creditors and business counterparties. For example, a portion of our hedging transactions include ratings triggers or well-capitalized language that permit counterparties to either request additional collateral or terminate our agreements with them based on our below investment grade ratings. Although we have been able to meet any additional collateral requirements thus far and expect that we would be able to enter into agreements with substitute counterparties if any of our existing agreements were terminated, changes in our ratings or capital levels below well capitalized could create additional costs for our businesses. In addition, servicing, licensing and custodial agreements that we are party to with third parties include ratings covenants. Servicing rights represent a contractual right and not a beneficial ownership interest in the underlying mortgage loans. Upon failure to maintain the required credit ratings, the third parties could have the right to require Popular to engage a substitute fund custodian and/or increase collateral levels securing the recourse obligations. Popular services residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions. Certain contractual agreements require us to post collateral to secure such recourse obligations if our required credit ratings are not maintained. Collateral pledged by us to secure recourse obligations approximated $81 million at December 31, 2015. We could be required to post additional collateral under the agreements. Management expects that we would be able to meet additional collateral requirements if and when needed. The requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of custodian funds could reduce Popular\u2019s liquidity resources and impact its operating results. The termination of those agreements or the inability to realize servicing income for our businesses could have an adverse effect on those businesses. Other counterparties are also sensitive to the risk of a ratings downgrade and the implications for our businesses and may be less likely to engage in transactions with us, or may only engage in them at a substantially higher cost, if our ratings remain below investment grade.\nWe are subject to regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and if we fail to meet these guidelines our business and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nUnder regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and other regulatory requirements, Popular and our banking subsidiaries must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off balance sheet items, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators regarding components, risk weightings and other factors. If we fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our business and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. If we fail to maintain well-capitalized status under the regulatory framework, or are deemed not well managed under regulatory exam procedures, or if we experience certain regulatory violations, our status as a financial holding company and our related eligibility for a streamlined review process for acquisition proposals, and our ability to offer certain financial products will be compromised and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Act, all financial companies with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, such as Popular, that are supervised by a primary federal financial regulatory agency, are required to perform an annual stress test. This stress test supports the regulator\u2019s analysis of the adequacy of a banking organization\u2019s capital and is required as part of Popular\u2019s capital management and review. The stress test is performed utilizing a variety of hypothetical stressed economic scenarios dictated by the Federal Reserve Board. If we are deemed to have inadequate capital under the hypothetical scenarios, then our regulator could prohibit us from taking certain capital actions, such as paying dividends, or require us to increase our regulatory capital, including the issuance of common stock that would dilute the ownership of existing shareholders.\nThe Basel III Capital Rules approved on July 9, 2013 by the U.S. federal banking agencies substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries. The Basel III Capital Rules revised the definitions and the components of regulatory capital, as well as modified certain asset risk weights and other matters affecting the numerator and denominator in a banking institutions\u2019 regulatory capital ratios thus implementing a new more complex methodology to calculate regulatory capital ratios. The Basel III Capital Rules became effective on January 1, 2015, subject to a phase-in period for certain provisions. The need to maintain more capital than has been historically required and calculated under revised standards could limit our business activities, including lending, and our ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. It could also depress our return on equity, thereby making it more difficult to earn our cost of capital. Moreover, although these new requirements are being phased-in over time, U.S. federal banking agencies have been taking into account future expectations regarding the ability of banks to meet these new requirements, including under stress conditions, in approving actions that represent uses of capital, such as dividends and acquisitions.\nDue to the importance and complexity of the stress test process and new capital rules calculations under Basel III, we have dedicated additional resources to comply with these requirements, however no assurance can be provided that these resources will be deemed sufficient or that we will be deemed to have adequate capital under the hypothetical economic stress scenarios which would affect our ability to take certain capital actions in the future.\nCertain of the provisions contained in our Certificate of Incorporation have the effect of making it more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board of Directors less responsive to stockholder control.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the members of the Board of Directors are divided into three classes as nearly equal as possible. At each annual meeting of stockholders, one-third of the members of the Board of Directors will be elected for a three-year term, and the other directors will remain in office until their three-year terms expire. Therefore, control of the Board of Directors cannot be changed in one year, and at least two annual meetings must be held before a majority of the members of the Board of Directors can be changed. Our certificate of incorporation also provides that a director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed by the stockholders only for cause by a vote of at least two -thirds of the combined voting power of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors. These provisions have the effect of making it more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board of Directors less responsive to stockholder control. These provisions also may tend to discourage attempts by third parties to acquire Popular because of the additional time and expense involved and a greater possibility of failure, and, as a result, may adversely affect the price that a potential purchaser would be willing to pay for the capital stock, thereby reducing the amount a stockholder might realize in, for example, a tender offer for our capital stock.\nThe resolution of significant pending litigation, if unfavorable, could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects.\nWe face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory\naction against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. For further information relating to our legal risk, see Note 30, \u201cCommitments & Contingencies\u201d, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe and our subsidiaries and affiliates, as well as EVERTEC, conduct business with financial institutions and/or card payment networks operating in countries whose nationals, including some of our customers\u2019 customers, engage in transactions in countries that are the targets of U.S. economic sanctions and embargoes. If we or our subsidiaries or affiliates or EVERTEC are found to have failed to comply with applicable U.S. sanctions laws and regulations in these instances, we could be exposed to fines, sanctions and other penalties or other governmental investigations.\nWe and our subsidiaries and affiliates, as well as EVERTEC, conduct business with financial institutions and/or card payment networks operating in countries whose nationals, including some of our customers\u2019 customers, engage in transactions in countries that are the target of U.S. economic sanctions and embargoes. As U.S. - based entities, we and our subsidiaries and affiliates, as well as EVERTEC, are obligated to comply with the economic sanctions regulations administered by OFAC. These regulations prohibit U.S.- based entities from entering into or facilitating unlicensed transactions with, for the benefit of, or in some cases involving the property and property interests of, persons, governments or countries designated by the U.S. government under one or more sanctions regimes and also prohibit transactions that provide a benefit that is received in a country designated under one or more sanctions regimes. Failure to comply with U.S. sanctions and embargoes may result in material fines, sanctions or other penalties being imposed on us. In addition, various state and municipal governments, universities and other investors maintain prohibitions or restrictions on investments in companies that do business involving sanctioned countries or entities, and this could adversely affect the market for our securities. For these reasons, we have established risk-based policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with applicable U.S. laws and regulations. EVERTEC has also done this. These policies and procedures employ software to screen transactions for evidence of sanctioned-country and persons involvement. Consistent with a risk-based approach and the difficulties in identifying all transactions of our customers\u2019 customers that may involve a sanctioned country, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us from violating applicable U.S. laws and regulations in transactions in which we engage, and such violations could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time we have identified and voluntarily self-disclosed to OFAC transactions that were not timely identified and blocked by our policies and procedures for screening transactions that might violate the economic sanctions regulations administered by OFAC. Although OFAC\u2019s response to our recent voluntary self-disclosures of these apparent violations has been to issue cautionary letters to us, there can be no assurances that our failures to comply with U.S. sanctions and embargoes will not result in material fines, sanctions or other penalties being imposed on us.\nWe have agreed to indemnify EVERTEC for certain claims or damages related to the economic sanctions regulations administered by OFAC. We cannot predict the timing, total costs or ultimate outcome of any OFAC review, or to what extent, if at all, we could be subject to indemnification claims, fines, sanctions or other penalties.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE FDIC-ASSISTED TRANSACTION\nRisks Related to the Westernbank FDIC-assisted Transaction.\nOn April 30, 2010, we entered into an FDIC-assisted transaction involving Westernbank, which could present additional risks to our business. In that transaction, BPPR acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Westernbank from the FDIC. Although this transaction provides for FDIC assistance to BPPR to mitigate certain risks, such as sharing exposure to loan losses (80% of the losses for a specified period in substantially all the acquired portfolio will be borne by the FDIC) and providing indemnification against certain liabilities of the former Westernbank, we are still subject to some of the same risks we would face in acquiring another bank in a negotiated transaction. Such risks include risks associated with maintaining customer relationships and failure to realize the anticipated acquisition benefits in the amounts and within the timeframes we expect. The loss sharing agreement applicable to commercial and other assets had a term of five years, which ended on June 30, 2015.\nThe success of the Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction will depend on a number of uncertain factors.\nThe success of the FDIC-assisted transaction will depend on a number of factors, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nour ability to limit the outflow of deposits held by our new customers in the acquired branches and to successfully retain and manage interest-earning assets (i.e., loans) acquired in the FDIC-assisted transaction;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract new deposits and to generate new interest-earning assets in the areas previously served by the former Westernbank branches;\n\u2022\nour ability to control the incremental non-interest expense from the former Westernbank branches and other units in a manner that enables us to maintain a favorable overall efficiency ratio;\n\u2022\nour ability to collect on the loans acquired and satisfy the standard requirements imposed in the loss sharing agreements; and\n\u2022\nour ability to earn acceptable levels of interest and non-interest income, including fee income, from the acquired branches.\nThe Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction increased BPPR\u2019s commercial real estate and construction loan portfolio, which have a greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans.\nWith the acquisition of most of the former Westernbank\u2019s loan portfolio, the commercial real estate loan and construction loan portfolios represent a larger portion of BPPR\u2019s total loan portfolio than prior to the FDIC-assisted transaction. This type of lending is generally considered to have more complex credit risks than traditional single-family residential or consumer lending, because the principal is concentrated in a limited number of loans with repayment dependent on the successful operation or completion of the related real estate or construction project. Consequently, these loans are more sensitive to the current adverse conditions in the real estate market and the general economy. These loans are generally less predictable, more difficult to evaluate and monitor, and their collateral may be more difficult to dispose of in a market decline. Furthermore, since these loans are to Puerto Rico based borrowers, Popular\u2019s credit exposure concentration in Puerto Rico increased as a result of the acquisition. Although, the negative economic aspects of these risks were substantially reduced as a result of the FDIC loss sharing agreements, changes in national and local economic conditions could lead to higher loan charge-offs in connection with the FDIC-assisted transaction all of which would not be totally supported by the loss sharing agreements with the FDIC.\nWe acquired significant portfolios of loans in the FDIC-assisted transaction. Although these loan portfolios were initially accounted for at fair value, there is no assurance that there will not be additional charge-offs to this portfolio. The fluctuations in national, regional and local economic conditions, including those related to local residential, commercial real estate and construction markets, may increase the level of charge-offs that we make to our loan portfolio, and consequently, reduce our net income, and may also increase the level of charge-offs on the loan portfolio that we have acquired and correspondingly reduce our net income. These fluctuations are not predictable, cannot be controlled and may have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition even if other favorable events occur.\nAlthough we entered into loss sharing agreements with the FDIC which provide that 80% of losses related to specified loan portfolios that we acquired in connection with the FDIC-assisted transaction will be borne by the FDIC, we are not protected for all losses resulting from charge-offs with respect to those specified loan portfolios. Additionally, the loss sharing agreements have limited terms, and the one applicable to commercial loans expired on June 30, 2015. Therefore, any charge-off of related losses that we experience after the term of the loss sharing agreements will not be reimbursed by the FDIC and will negatively impact our results of operations. The loss sharing agreements also impose standard requirements on us which must be satisfied in order to retain loss share protections. The FDIC has the right to refuse or delay payment for loan losses if the loss sharing agreements are not managed in accordance with their terms.\nOur decisions regarding the fair value of assets acquired could be inaccurate and our estimated loss share indemnification asset in the Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction may be inaccurate, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects.\nManagement made various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of acquired loan portfolios, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of secured loans. In the Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction, we recorded a loss share indemnification asset that we consider\nadequate to absorb future losses which may occur in the acquired loan portfolio. In determining the size of the loss share indemnification asset, we analyze the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, volume and classification of loans, volume and trends in delinquencies and nonaccruals, local economic conditions, and other pertinent information. If our assumptions are incorrect, our actual losses could be higher than estimated and increased loss reserves may be needed to respond to different economic conditions or adverse developments in the acquired loan portfolio. Any increase in future loan losses could have a negative effect on our operating results. However, in the event expected losses from the Westernbank portfolio were to increase more than originally expected prior to the expiration of the applicable loss share periods, the related increase in loss reserves would be largely offset by higher than expected indemnity payments from the FDIC. To the extent that estimated losses on the Westernbank portfolio are not realized before the expiration of the loss sharing agreements (June 30, 2015 for the commercial loss share agreement and June 30, 2020 for the single-family loss share agreement), such losses would not be subject to reimbursement from the FDIC and, accordingly, would require us to make a material adjustment to the value of our loss share indemnification asset and the related true up payment obligation to the FDIC, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results for the period in which such adjustment is taken.\nRefer to Note 14 of the accompanying financial statements for additional information on the Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction, including the accounting for the indemnification asset assets and true up payment obligation. Also, refer to Note 12 for information on the accounting for the acquired loan portfolio.\nOur ability to obtain reimbursement under the loss sharing agreements on covered assets depends on our compliance with the terms of the loss sharing agreements.\nThe loss share agreements contain specific terms and conditions regarding the management of the covered assets that BPPR must follow to receive reimbursement on losses from the FDIC. Under the loss share agreements, BPPR must:\n\u2022\nmanage and administer the covered assets and collect and effect charge-offs and recoveries with respect to such covered assets in a manner consistent with its usual and prudent business and banking practices and, with respect to single family shared-loss loans, the procedures (including collection procedures) customarily employed by BPPR in servicing and administering mortgage loans for its own account and the servicing procedures established by FNMA or FHLMC, as in effect from time to time, and in accordance with accepted mortgage servicing practices of prudent lending institutions;\n\u2022\nexercise its best judgment in managing, administering and collecting amounts on covered assets and effecting charge-offs with respect to the covered assets;\n\u2022\nuse commercially reasonable efforts to maximize recoveries with respect to losses on single family shared-loss assets and best efforts to maximize collections with respect to commercial shared-loss assets;\n\u2022\nretain sufficient staff to perform the duties under the loss share agreements;\n\u2022\nadopt and implement accounting, reporting, record-keeping and similar systems with respect to the commercial shared-loss assets;\n\u2022\ncomply with the terms of the modification guidelines approved by the FDIC or another federal agency for any single-family shared loss loan;\n\u2022\nprovide notice with respect to proposed transactions pursuant to which a third party or affiliate will manage, administer or collect any commercial shared-loss assets; and\n\u2022\nfile monthly and quarterly certificates with the FDIC specifying the amount of losses, charge-offs and recoveries.\nUnder the loss share agreements, BPPR is also required to maintain books and records sufficient to ensure and document compliance with the terms of the loss share agreements.\nUnder the terms of the loss share agreements, BPPR is also required to deliver certain certificates regarding compliance with the terms of each of the loss share agreements and the computations required there under. The required terms of the agreements are extensive and failure to comply with any of the guidelines could result in a specific asset or group of assets permanently losing their loss sharing coverage. BPPR believes that it has complied with such terms and conditions. The loss share\nagreement applicable to the commercial late stage real-estate-collateral-dependent loans described below provides for loss sharing by the FDIC through the quarter ending June 30, 2015 and for reimbursement to the FDIC through the quarter ending June 30, 2018.\nFor the quarters ended June 30, 2010 through March 31, 2012, BPPR received reimbursement for loss-share claims submitted to the FDIC, including charge-offs for certain commercial late stage real-estate-collateral-dependent loans and OREO calculated in accordance with BPPR\u2019s charge-off policy for non-covered assets. When BPPR submitted its shared-loss claim in connection with the June 30, 2012 quarter, however, the FDIC refused to reimburse BPPR for a portion of the claim because of a difference related to the methodology for the computation of charge-offs for certain commercial late stage real-estate-collateral-dependent loans and OREO. In accordance with the terms of the commercial loss share agreement, BPPR applied a methodology for charge-offs for late stage real-estate-collateral-dependent loans that conforms to its regulatory supervisory criteria and is calculated in accordance with BPPR\u2019s charge-off policy for non-covered assets. The FDIC stated that it believed that BPPR should use a different methodology for those charge-offs. Notwithstanding the FDIC\u2019s refusal to reimburse BPPR for certain shared-loss claims, BPPR had continued to calculate shared-loss claims for quarters subsequent to June 30, 2012 in accordance with its charge-off policy for non-covered assets.\nBPPR\u2019s loss share agreements with the FDIC specify that disputes can be submitted to arbitration before a review board under the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. On July 31, 2013, BPPR filed a statement of claim with the American Arbitration Association requesting that a review board determine certain matters relating to the loss-share claims under its commercial loss share agreement with the FDIC, including that the review board award BPPR the amounts owed under its unpaid quarterly certificates. The statement of claim also included requests for reimbursement of certain valuation adjustments for discounts to appraised values, costs to sell troubled assets and other items. The review board was comprised of one arbitrator appointed by BPPR, one arbitrator appointed by the FDIC and a third arbitrator selected by agreement of those arbitrators.\nOn October 17, 2014, BPPR and the FDIC settled all claims and counterclaims that had been submitted to the review board. The settlement provides for an agreed valuation methodology for reimbursement of charge-offs for late stage real-estate-collateral-dependent loans and resulting OREO. BPPR applied this valuation methodology to charge-offs claimed on late stage real-estate-collateral-dependent loans and resulting OREO during the remaining term of the commercial loss-sharing agreement which expired on June 30, 2015.\nOn November 25, 2014, the FDIC notified BPPR that it (a) would not reimburse BPPR under the commercial loss share agreement for a $66.6 million loss claim on eight related real estate loans that BPPR restructured and consolidated (collectively, the \u201cDisputed Asset\u201d), and (b) would no longer treat the Disputed Asset as a \u201cShared-Loss Asset\u201d under the commercial loss share agreement. The FDIC alleged that BPPR\u2019s restructure and modification of the underlying loans did not constitute a \u201cPermitted Amendment\u201d under the commercial loss share agreement, thereby causing the bank to breach Article III of the commercial loss share agreement. BPPR disagrees with the FDIC\u2019s determinations relating to the Disputed Asset, and accordingly, on December 19, 2014, delivered to the FDIC a notice of dispute under the commercial loss share agreement.\nOn March 19, 2015, BPPR filed a statement of claim with the American Arbitration Association requesting that a review board determine BPPR and the FDIC\u2019s disputes concerning the Disputed Asset. The statement of claim requests a declaration that the Disputed Asset is a \u201cShared-Loss Asset\u201d under the commercial loss share agreement, a declaration that the restructuring is a \u201cPermitted Amendment\u201d under the commercial loss share agreement, and an order that the FDIC reimburse the bank for approximately $53.3 million for the Charge-Off of the Disputed Asset, plus interest at the applicable rate. On April 1, 2015, the FDIC notified BPPR that it was clawing back approximately $1.7 million in reimbursable expenses relating to the Disputed Asset that the FDIC had previously paid to BPPR. Thus, on April 13, 2015, BPPR notified the American Arbitration Association and the FDIC of an increase in the amount of its damages by approximately $1.7 million. The review board in the arbitration concerning the Disputed Asset is comprised of one arbitrator appointed by BPPR, one arbitrator appointed by the FDIC and a third arbitrator selected by agreement of those arbitrators. The arbitration hearing has been scheduled for August 2016.\nIn addition, in November and December 2014, BPPR proposed separate portfolio sales of Shared-Loss Assets to the FDIC. The FDIC refused to consent to either sale, stating that those sales did not represent best efforts to maximize collections on Shared-Loss Assets under the commercial loss share agreement. In March 2015, BPPR proposed a third portfolio sale to the FDIC, and in May 2015, BPPR proposed a fourth portfolio sale to the FDIC.\nBPPR disagrees with the FDIC\u2019s characterization of the November and December 2014 portfolio sale proposals and with the FDIC\u2019s interpretation of the commercial loss share agreement provision governing portfolio sales. Accordingly, on March 13, 2015, BPPR delivered to the FDIC a notice of dispute under the commercial loss share agreement. On June 8, 2015, BPPR filed a statement of claim with the American Arbitration Association requesting that a review board resolve the disputes concerning those proposed portfolio sales. On June 15, 2015, BPPR amended its statement of claim to include a claim for the FDIC-R\u2019s refusal to timely concur in the third sale proposed in March 2015. On June 29, 2015, the FDIC informed BPPR that it would reimburse the bank for losses arising from the primary portfolio of the third proposed sale, but only subject to conditions to which BPPR objected. The FDIC also informed BPPR that it would not concur in the sale of the remainder (the \u201csecondary portfolio\u201d) of the third proposed sale or in the fourth proposed sale. On September 4, 2015, BPPR filed a second amended statement of claim concerning the FDIC\u2019s refusal to concur in the third and fourth portfolio sales as proposed by BPPR. On November 25, 2015, BPPR conducted an auction sale of the loans in the primary portfolio of the third proposed sale and intends to submit a claim for reimbursement of the losses arising from that sale. The review board in the arbitration concerning the proposed portfolio sales is comprised of one arbitrator appointed by BPPR, one arbitrator appointed by the FDIC and a third arbitrator selected by agreement of those arbitrators. The arbitration hearing is scheduled to be held in the fall of 2016.\nOn November 12, 2015, the FDIC notified BPPR that it (a) would deny certain claims included in BPPR\u2019s Second Quarter 2015 Quarterly Certificate and (b) withhold payment of approximately $5.5 million attributed to the $6.9 million in losses claimed under the denied claims. In support of its denial, the FDIC alleged that BPPR did not comply with its obligation under the commercial loss share agreement, including compliance with certain provisions of GAAP, acting in accordance with prudent banking practices, managing Shared-Loss Assets in the same manner as BPPR\u2019s non-Shared-Loss Assets, and using best efforts to maximize collections on the Shared-Loss Assets. BPPR disagrees with the FDIC\u2019s allegations relating to the denied claims included in BPPR\u2019s Second Quarter 2015 Quarterly Certificate, and accordingly, on January 27, 2016 delivered to the FDIC a notice of dispute under the commercial loss share agreement.\nThe shared-loss arrangement described above expired on June 30, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, BPPR had unreimbursed loss claims related to the commercial loss-sharing arrangement amounting to $234 million, reflected in the FDIC indemnification asset as a receivable from the FDIC, which include approximately $85 million related to losses claimed during the second quarter of 2015 as described above and approximately $149 million which are subject to the arbitration proceedings described above. This last figure may continue to increase to the extent that the assets that are the subject of the portfolio sales arbitration further decline in value. Until these disputes are finally resolved, the terms of the commercial loss share agreement will remain in effect with respect to any such items under dispute. No assurance can be given that we will receive reimbursement from the FDIC with respect to the foregoing items, which could require us to make a material adjustment to the value of our loss share asset and the related true up payment obligation to the FDIC and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results for the period in which such adjustment is taken.\nThe loss sharing agreement applicable to single-family residential mortgage loans provides for FDIC loss sharing and BPPR reimbursement to the FDIC for ten years (ending on June 30, 2020), and the loss sharing agreement applicable to commercial and other assets provides for FDIC loss sharing and BPPR reimbursement to the FDIC for five years (ending on June 30, 2015), with additional recovery sharing for three years thereafter. As of December 31, 2015, the carrying value of covered loans approximated $646 million, mainly comprised of single-family residential mortgage loans. To the extent that estimated losses on covered loans are not realized before the expiration of the applicable loss sharing agreement, such losses would not be subject to reimbursement from the FDIC and, accordingly, would require us to make a material adjustment in the value of our loss share asset and the related true up payment obligation to the FDIC and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results for the period in which such adjustment is taken.\nRISKS RELATED TO ACQUISITION OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND DEPOSITS OF DORAL BANK FROM THE FDIC AS RECEIVER\nOur acquisition of certain assets and deposits of Doral Bank from the FDIC as receiver could magnify certain of the risks our business already faces and could present new risks.\nOn February 27, 2015, BPPR, in an alliance with co-bidders, including BPNA, acquired certain assets and all deposits (other than certain brokered deposits) of Doral Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver. See \u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Acquisition of Certain Assets and Deposits of Doral Bank from the FDIC as Receiver\u201d for a description of the transaction. The transaction could magnify certain of the risks our business already faces that are described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and could present new risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nrisks associated with weak economic conditions in the economy and in the real estate markets in our geographic footprint, which adversely affect real estate prices, the job market, consumer confidence and spending habits, which may affect, among other things, the continued status of the loans we acquired as performing assets, charge-offs and provision expense;\n\u2022\nrisk associated with conditions taxi industry, including regulatory and competitive environment in New York City, which may affect Doral Bank\u2019s taxi portfolio;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with maintaining customer relationships, including managing any potential customer confusion caused by the alliance structure;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with the limited amount of diligence able to be conducted by a buyer in an FDIC transaction;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates and market liquidity which may reduce interest margins; and\n\u2022\nchanges in market rates and prices that may adversely impact the value of financial assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nfailure to realize the anticipated acquisition benefits in the amounts and within the timeframes we expect, including failure to meet our expectation that the transaction is accretive within the first 12 months.\nManagement made various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of acquired loan portfolios, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of secured loans. In estimating the extent of the losses, we analyze the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, volume and classification of loans, volume and trends in delinquencies and nonaccruals, local economic conditions, and other pertinent information. If our assumptions are incorrect, our actual losses could be higher than estimated and increased loss reserves may be needed to respond to different economic conditions or adverse developments in the acquired loan portfolio. Any increase in future loan losses could have a negative effect on our operating results.\nRISKS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES\nPotential issuance of additional shares of our Common Stock could further dilute existing holders of our Common Stock.\nThe potential issuance of additional shares of our Common Stock or common equivalent securities in future equity offerings would dilute the ownership interest of our existing common stockholders.\nDividends on our Common Stock and Preferred Stock may be suspended and stockholders may not receive funds in connection with their investment in our Common Stock or Preferred Stock without selling their shares.\nHolders of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. During 2009, we suspended dividend payments on our Common Stock and Preferred Stock. We resumed payment of dividends on our Preferred Stock in December 2010 and on our Common Stock in October 2015. There can be no assurance that any dividends will be declared on the Preferred Stock or Common Stock in any future periods.\nThis could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock. Also, we are a bank holding company and our ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain Federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board regarding capital adequacy and dividends. Moreover, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have issued policy statements stating that the bank holding companies and insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. In the current financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve Board has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged dividend pay-out ratios that are at the 100% or higher level unless both asset quality and capital are very strong.\nIn addition, the terms of our outstanding junior subordinated debt securities held by each trust that has issued trust preferred securities, prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our capital stock, including our Common Stock and Preferred Stock, or from purchasing, acquiring, or making a liquidation payment on such stock, if we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing.\nAccordingly, shareholders may have to sell some or all of their shares of our Common Stock or Preferred Stock in order to generate cash flow from their investment. Shareholders may not realize a gain on their investment when they sell the Common Stock or Preferred Stock and may lose the entire amount of their investment.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONS\nCyber-attacks, system risks and data protection breaches could present significant reputational, legal and regulatory costs.\nPopular is under continuous threat of cyber-attacks especially as we continue to expand customer services via the internet and other remote service channels. The most significant cyber-attack risks that we may face are e-fraud, denial-of-service and computer intrusion that might result in loss of sensitive customer data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals breach and extract funds from customer or bank accounts. Denial-of-service disrupts services available to our customers through our on-line banking system. Computer intrusion attempts might result in the breach of sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers, and could present significant reputational, legal and/or regulatory costs to Popular if successful. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of the threats from organized cybercriminals and hackers, and our plans to continue to provide e-banking and mobile banking services to our customers. We have not, to date, experienced any material losses as a result of cyber-attacks.\nIf personal, non-public, confidential or proprietary information of customers in our possession were to be mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird parties provide key components of our business operations such as data processing, information security, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, failure of a vendor to notify us of a reportable event, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor\u2019s ability to serve us. Replacing these third party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations.\nHurricanes and other weather-related events, as well as man-made disasters, could cause a disruption in our operations or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nA significant portion of our operations are located in a region susceptible to hurricanes. Such weather events can cause disruption to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our overall results of operations. We maintain hurricane insurance, including coverage for lost profits and extra expense; however, there is no insurance against the disruption to the markets that we serve that a catastrophic hurricane could produce. Further, a hurricane in any of our market areas could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to timely repay their loans and may adversely impact the value of any collateral held by us. Man-made disasters and other events connected with the regions in which we operate could have similar effects. The severity and impact of future hurricanes and other weather-related events are difficult to predict and may be exacerbated by global climate change. The effects of future hurricanes and other weather-related events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFor further information of other risks faced by Popular please refer to the Management\u2019s Discussion & Analysis section of the Annual Report.", "PERMNO": 16505, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BPOP"}
