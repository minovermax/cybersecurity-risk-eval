{"cik": "1556739", "company": "DEX MEDIA, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below. The occurrence of one or more of these events could significantly and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. The risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, are not necessarily the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those that we currently deem to be immaterial may materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nRisks Related to Our Business and our Financial Condition and Capital Structure\nWe have substantial indebtedness that could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt and significant debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2014, we had total outstanding debt with a face value of $2,599 million. Our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to make payments on our indebtedness. In addition, we may not be able to obtain financing or refinance our existing indebtedness on satisfactory terms or at all. Our substantial indebtedness could have other important consequences and significant effects on our business and prospects. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nIncrease our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n\u2022\nRequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nLimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nRestrict us from pursuing business opportunities;\n\u2022\nMake it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations, including payments on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nPlace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nLimit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other general corporate purposes.\nAny of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and ability to satisfy our outstanding debt obligations.\nThe senior secured credit facilities and senior subordinated notes of the Company may restrict our future operations, including our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.\nThe senior secured credit facilities and senior subordinated notes of the Company impose significant operating and financial restrictions upon us and may limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nIncur liens or other encumbrances;\n\u2022\nMake acquisitions, loans and investments;\n\u2022\nSell or otherwise dispose of assets;\n\u2022\nIncur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nPay dividends, make distributions and pay certain indebtedness;\n\u2022\nEnter into sale and leaseback transactions; and\n\u2022\nEnter into swap transactions and certain affiliate transactions.\nIn addition, our debt covenants require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. There can be no assurance that we\nwill be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from our senior secured creditors and/or amend the covenants.\nOur failure to comply with the covenants or to maintain the required financial ratios contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default under such indebtedness, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Additionally, our default under one agreement covering our indebtedness may trigger cross-defaults under other agreements covering our indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default or cross-default under any of the agreements governing our indebtedness, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be due and payable and exercise other remedies. In the event our lenders accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness, we would not have sufficient cash to repay that indebtedness, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate as a going concern. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the agreements governing our indebtedness, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness that may not be successful.\nOur ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund working capital needs and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nIf our business does not generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity thereof, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, we may not be able to affect any of these actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate as a going concern.\nWe could recognize impairment charges for our intangible assets or goodwill.\nAt December 31, 2014, the net carrying value of our goodwill was $315 million and intangible assets were $794 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded an impairment charge of $458 million consisting of a non-cash impairment charge of $74 million related to the write down of goodwill, and a non-cash impairment charge of $384 million related to the write down of intangible assets.\nSignificant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business resulting in further declines in advertising sales and operating results, further declines in the value of the Company\u2019s debt and equity securities, unexpected or planned changes in the use of assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in future impairments to goodwill and intangible assets, and we may be required to assess the recoverability of goodwill and the useful lives of our intangible assets and other long-lived assets.\nThese factors, including changes to assumptions used in our impairment analysis as a result of these factors, could result in future impairment charges, and/or a reduction of remaining useful lives associated with our intangible assets and other long-lived assets resulting in an acceleration of amortization expense. Future impairment charges could significantly affect our results of operations in the periods recognized.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or file our periodic reports\nin a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nWe are subject to the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, particularly Section 404, and the applicable SEC rules and regulations that require an annual report of our management on our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports in a timely manner. In connection with the audit of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014, we concluded that there was a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting associated with ineffective general computing controls for certain information systems that are used for accounts receivable and revenue recognition. For further detail regarding these deficiencies and our remediation efforts to address the material weakness, see Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. These ineffective general computing controls were related to weak system access and change management controls. In addition, certain review controls were not performed at a sufficient level of precision to detect if these systems were producing complete and accurate information.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. However, management has concluded that this material weakness did not produce a material misstatement to our financial statements or related disclosures included in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nManagement will take action to remediate this material weakness in 2015 by designing and implementing effective general computing controls associated with system access and change management. In addition, management will design and implement effective review controls to ensure the completeness and accuracy of system generated information. However, we cannot assure you that these efforts will remediate our material weaknesses in a timely manner, or at all, or prevent restatements of our financial statements in the future. If we are unable to successfully remediate our material weakness or identify any future material weaknesses, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports, and our stock price may decline as a result.\nIf we fail to remediate our material weakness or fail to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting, any new or recurring material weakness could impair our ability to prevent material misstatements in our financial statements, which could cause our business to suffer.\nWe may not realize the benefits that we expect from our business transformation program.\nOn December 11, 2014 the Company announced an organizational restructuring program designed to reorganize and refocus the Company. The successful implementation of the program presents significant organizational design and infrastructure challenges. In addition, the program may not advance our business strategy as expected. As a result, we may not be able to implement the program as planned, including realizing, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits from our program. Events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits. Any failure to implement the program in accordance with our expectations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur business and financial condition would be adversely affected by a prolonged economic downturn and other external events.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is derived from the sale of advertising. Expenditures by advertising clients are sensitive to economic conditions and tend to decline in a recession or other periods of economic uncertainty. Any decline of this type could materially affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur business was subject to the impact of previous adverse economic conditions, including customer attrition, declines in overall advertising spending by our customers, and the significant impact of the weak local business conditions on consumer spending in our client's markets. Our total operating revenue was negatively affected by the previous economic downturn. Future economic conditions or other events that could impact purchasing patterns could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe continuing decline in the use of print yellow pages continues to adversely affect our business.\nOverall references to print yellow page directories in the United States have declined from 14.5 billion in 2005 to 4.7 billion in 2013 according to a Local Search Association (formerly known as the Yellow Pages Association) Industry Usage Study issued\nin March 2014. This decline is primarily attributable to increased use of Internet search providers, as well as the proliferation of very large retail stores for which consumers and businesses may not reference the yellow pages. We expect the decline in usage will continue to negatively affect advertising sales associated with our traditional print business. A significant further decline in usage of our print directories could impair our ability to maintain or increase advertising prices and cause businesses to reduce or discontinue purchasing advertising in our yellow page directories. Either or both of these factors could adversely affect our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. These trends have resulted in print advertising sales declining in 2014, and we expect these trends to continue in 2015 and beyond.\nWe face widespread competition from other print directory publishers and other traditional and new media. This competition may reduce our market share or materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe directory advertising industry in the United States is highly competitive. Some of the incumbent publishers with which we compete are or may become larger than we are and have or may obtain greater financial resources than we have. Although we may have limited market overlap with incumbent publishers, relative to the size of our overall footprint, we may not be able to compete effectively with these publishers for advertising sales in these limited markets. In addition, independent publishers may commit more resources to certain markets than we are able to commit, thus limiting our ability to compete effectively in these areas.\nWe also compete for advertising sales with other traditional media, including newspapers, magazines, radio, direct mail, telemarketing, billboards and television. Many of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources than we have. The market share of these competitors may increase and our market share may decrease.\nWe also compete for advertising sales with new media. The Internet continues to be increasingly accessible as a local media for businesses of all sizes. We face competition from search engines and portals, such as Google, Yahoo! and Bing, among others, some of which have entered into commercial agreements with us and other major directory publishers. Internet search engines and service providers including but not limited to Google, Yahoo!, Bing, Facebook and Twitter also have significantly greater technological and financial resources than we do, and their accumulated customer information allows them to offer targeted advertising on a scale greater than ours. Further, the use of the Internet, including the use of wireless devices, has resulted in new technologies and services that compete with traditional local media. Through DexKnows.com and Superpages.com, we compete with the Internet yellow page directories of other publishers, such as Yellowpages.com, as well as other Internet sites that provide classified directory information, such as Citysearch.com. We may not be able to compete effectively for advertising with these other companies, some of which have greater resources than we do. Our digital strategy may be adversely affected if major search engines build local sales forces or otherwise begin to more effectively market to small and medium sized local businesses.\nIncreased competition in local telephone markets could reduce the benefits of using the local telephone service providers\u2019 brand name.\nAdvances in communications technology (including wireless devices and voice over Internet protocol) and demographic factors (including shifts from wireline telephone communications to wireless or other communications technologies) continue to erode the market position of the local telephone service providers. The use of traditional local telephone service providers is declining. We believe the loss of market share by local telephone service providers in any particular local service area decreases the value of their brand name in those particular local telephone markets. As a result, we may not fully realize the benefits of our commercial arrangements with the local telephone service providers.\nIf we fail to anticipate or respond effectively to changes in technology and consumer preferences, our competitive position could be harmed.\nThe local search advertising industry is subject to changes arising from developments in technology, including information distribution methods and users\u2019 technological preferences. The use of the Internet and wireless devices by consumers as a means to transact commerce may result in new technologies being developed and services being provided that could compete with our services. Internet search engines and service providers such as Google, Yahoo!, Bing, Facebook and Twitter, among others, are placing a high priority on local commercial search initiatives and also have significantly greater technological and financial resources than we do, and their accumulated customer information allows them to offer targeted advertising on a greater scale than ours. As a result of these factors, our growth and future financial performance may depend on our ability to develop and market new products and services, to negotiate satisfactory strategic arrangements with national search companies and utilize new distribution channels, while enhancing existing products, services and distribution channels, to incorporate the latest technological advances and accommodate changing user preferences, including the use of the Internet and wireless devices. We may not be able to develop and market new services. In addition, if we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to\nchanges in technology and user preferences or are unable to finance the capital expenditures necessary to respond to such changes, it could adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nA breach of our information technology systems could harm our business and our customers.\nA breach of cyber/data security that impairs our information technology infrastructure could disrupt normal business operations and affect our ability to control our assets, access customer information, and limit communication with third parties. Any loss of confidential or proprietary data through a breach could materially and adversely affect our reputation, expose us to legal claims, impair our ability to execute on business strategies and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur reliance on technology could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMost of our business activities rely to a significant degree on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems and those of others. Any failure of existing or future systems could impair our ability to collect, process and store data and perform the day-to-day management of our business. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur computer and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources. A natural disaster or other unanticipated problems that lead to the corruption or loss of data at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur reliance on, and extension of credit to, small and medium sized local businesses could adversely affect our business.\nAs of December 31, 2014, approximately 86% of our advertising revenues were derived from the sale of our marketing solutions to local businesses, which are generally small and medium sized businesses. In the ordinary course of our business, we extend credit to these customers in the form of a trade receivable for advertising purchases. Local businesses, however, tend to have fewer financial resources and higher failure rates than large businesses, especially during a downturn in the general economy. The proliferation of very large retail stores may continue to adversely affect local businesses. We believe these limitations are significant contributing factors to having customers not renew their advertising. If customers fail to pay within specified credit terms, we may cancel their advertising in future directories, which could further impact our ability to collect past due amounts, as well as adversely impact our advertising sales and revenue trends. In addition, full or partial collection of delinquent accounts can take an extended period of time. Consequently, we could be adversely affected by our dependence on and our extension of credit to local businesses in the form of trade receivables.\nOur dependence on third party providers for printing, publishing and distribution services could materially affect us.\nWe depend on third parties to print, publish and distribute our directories. In connection with these services, we rely on the systems and services of our third party service providers, their ability to perform key functions on our behalf in a timely manner and in accordance with agreed levels of service, and their ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel to perform services on our behalf. There are a limited number of these providers with sufficient scale to meet our needs. A failure in the systems of one of our key third party service providers, or their inability to perform in accordance with the terms of our contracts or to retain sufficient qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nIf we were to lose the services of any of our key third party service providers, we would be required to hire and train sufficient personnel to perform these services or to find an alternative service provider. In some cases it would be impracticable for us to perform these functions, including the printing of our directories. In the event we were required to perform any of the services that we currently outsource, it is unlikely that we would be able to perform them without incurring additional costs.\nWe have agreements with several major Internet search engines and portals. The termination of one or more of these agreements could adversely affect our business.\nWe have expanded our Internet distribution by establishing relationships with several other Internet yellow page directory providers, portals, search engines and individual websites, which makes our content easier for search engines to access and provides a greater response to general searches on the Internet. Under the terms of the agreements with these Internet providers, we place our clients\u2019 advertisements on major search engines, which give us access to a higher volume of traffic than we could generate on our own, without relinquishing the client relationship. The search engines benefit from our local sales force and full\nservice capabilities for attracting and serving advertisers that might not otherwise transact business with search engines. The termination of one or more of our agreements with major search engines could adversely affect our business.\nIncreases in the price or decreases in the availability of paper could materially adversely affect our costs of operations.\nPaper is the principal raw material we use to produce our print directories. The price of paper is set each year based on total tonnage by supplier, paper basis weights, production capacity and market price.\nWe do not engage in hedging activities to limit our exposure to increases in paper prices. If we cannot secure access to paper in the necessary amounts or at reasonable prices, or if paper costs increase substantially, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur sales of advertising to national accounts are dependent upon third parties that we do not control.\nApproximately 14% of our advertising revenue is derived from the sale of advertising to national or large regional companies, including rental car companies, insurance companies and pizza delivery companies. These companies typically purchase advertisements for placement in multiple geographic regions. Substantially all of the revenue from these large advertisers is derived through certified marketing representatives (\"CMRs\"). CMRs are independent third parties that act as agents for national companies and design their advertisements, arrange for the placement of those advertisements in our markets and provide billing services. Our relationships with these national advertisers depend significantly on the performance of the CMRs, which we do not control. If some or all of the CMRs with whom we have existing relationships were unable or unwilling to transact business with us on acceptable terms or at all, this inability or unwillingness could materially adversely affect our business. In addition, any decline in the performance of the CMRs could harm our ability to generate revenue from national accounts and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nTurnover among our sales force or key management could adversely affect our business.\nThe success of our business is dependent on the leadership of our key personnel. The loss of a significant number of experienced key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Our success also depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified sales personnel in each of the regions in which we operate. We currently expend significant resources and management time in identifying and training our local marketing consultants and sales managers. Our ability to attract and retain qualified sales personnel will depend, however, on numerous factors, including factors outside our control, such as conditions in the local employment markets in which we operate.\nFurthermore, our success depends on the continued services of key personnel, including our experienced senior management team as well as our regional sales management personnel. If we fail to retain the necessary key personnel, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nA portion of our employees are union-represented. Our business could be adversely affected by future labor negotiations and our ability to maintain good relations with our unionized employees.\nAs of December 31, 2014, approximately 1,000, or 29%, of our employees were represented by unions. In addition, the employees of some of our key suppliers are represented by unions. Work stoppages or slowdowns involving our union-represented employees, or those of our suppliers, could significantly disrupt our operations and increase operating costs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe inability to negotiate acceptable terms with the unions could also result in increased operating costs from higher wages or benefits paid to union employees or replacement workers. A greater percentage of our work force could also become represented by unions. If a union decides to strike, and others choose to honor its picket line, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe loss of important intellectual property rights could adversely affect our results of operations and future prospects.\nVarious trademarks and other intellectual property rights are key to our business. We rely upon a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws as well as contractual arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights. We may be required to bring lawsuits against third parties to protect our intellectual property rights. Similarly, we may be party to proceedings by third parties challenging our rights. Lawsuits brought by us may not be successful, or we may be found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others. As the commercial use of the Internet further expands, it may be more\ndifficult to protect our trade names, including DexKnows.com and Superpages.com, from domain name infringement or to prevent others from using Internet domain names that associate their businesses with ours. In the past, we have received claims of material infringement of intellectual property rights. Related lawsuits, regardless of the outcome, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, the loss of important trademarks or other intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect upon our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nIncreased regulation regarding information technology could lead to increased costs.\nAs the Internet continues to develop, the provision of Internet services and the commercial use of the Internet and Internet-related applications may become subject to greater regulation. Regulation of the Internet and Internet-related services is still developing, both by new laws and government regulation, and also by industry self-regulation. If our regulatory environment becomes more restrictive, including increased Internet regulation, our profitability could decrease.\nLaws and regulations directed at limiting or restricting the distribution of our print directories or shifting the costs and responsibilities of waste management related to our print directories could adversely affect our business.\nA number of states and municipalities are considering, and a limited number of municipalities have enacted, legislation or regulations that would limit or restrict our ability to distribute our print directories in the markets we serve. The most restrictive laws or regulations would prohibit us from distributing our print directories unless residents affirmatively \u201copt in\u201d to receive our print directories. Other, less restrictive, laws or regulations would require us to allow residents to \u201copt out\u201d of receiving our print directories. In addition, some states and municipalities are considering legislation or regulations that would shift the costs and responsibilities of waste management for discarded directories from municipalities to the producers of the directories. These laws and regulations will likely, if and where adopted, increase our costs, reduce the number of directories that are distributed, and negatively impact our ability to market our advertising to new and existing clients. If these or similar laws and regulations are widely adopted, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nLegal actions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nVarious lawsuits and other claims typical for a business of our size and nature are pending against us. In addition, from time to time, we receive communications from government or regulatory agencies concerning investigations or allegations of noncompliance with laws or regulations in jurisdictions in which we operate. Any potential judgments, fines or penalties relating to these matters, may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe are also exposed to other claims and litigation relating to our business, as well as methods of collection, processing and use of personal data. Our clients and users of client data collected and processed by us could also file claims against us if our data were found to be inaccurate, or if personal data stored by us were improperly accessed and disseminated by unauthorized persons. These claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nRisks Related to Agreements with Local Telephone Service Providers\nThe bankruptcy of any of our telecommunication partners could adversely affect us.\nIn the event that any of our telecommunications partners sought protection under bankruptcy laws, our agreements with such partners could be materially adversely impacted. In addition, our telecommunication partners may be unable in such circumstance to provide services to us under our contracts with them. Consequently, the bankruptcy of any of our telecommunication partners could have an adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nRegulatory obligations requiring local telephone service providers to publish white page directories in their markets may change over time, which may increase our future operating costs.\nRegulations established by state public utility commissions typically require local telephone service providers to publish and distribute white page directories of certain residences and businesses that order or receive local telephone service from the local telephone service providers. These regulations also require a local telephone service provider, in specified cases, to include information relating to the provision of telephone service provided by the local telephone service provider in the service area,\nas well as information relating to local and state governmental agencies. The costs of publishing, printing and distributing the white page directories are included in our operating expenses.\nUnder the terms of our publishing agreements with the local telephone service providers, we are required to perform their regulatory obligation to publish white page directories in the markets in which we are the directory publisher. If any additional legal requirements are imposed with respect to this obligation, we would be obligated to comply with these requirements even if they were to increase our operating costs. Our results of operations relative to competing directory publishers that do not have those obligations could be adversely affected due to these potential compliance costs.\nOur inability to enforce the non-competition agreements with the local telephone service providers may impair the value of our business.\nWe entered into non-competition agreements with certain local telephone service providers pursuant to which they each agreed not to publish tangible or digital (excluding Internet) media directories consisting principally of wireline listings and classified advertisements of subscribers in the markets in which we are the publisher of their directories. However, under applicable law, a covenant not to compete is only enforceable to the extent it is necessary to protect a legitimate business interest of the party seeking enforcement; if it does not unreasonably restrain the party against whom enforcement is sought; and if it is not contrary to the public interest.\nEnforceability of non-competition covenants may be uncertain. If a court were to determine that the non-competition agreement is unenforceable (in full or in part), the restricted parties could compete directly against us in the previously restricted markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock and Shareholders\nOur common stock could be subject to future dilution and, as a result, could decline in value.\nThe ownership percentage represented by common stock could be subject to dilution in the event that common stock is issued pursuant to the Company\u2019s long-term incentive plans, including issuances upon the exercise of options, and any other shares of common stock that are issued. In the future, similar to all companies, additional equity financings or other share issuances by us could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Sales by existing holders of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market, the perception that additional sales could occur, or other factors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends with respect to our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends or other distributions with respect to our common stock for the foreseeable future. In addition, covenants in our credit facilities restrict us from paying cash dividends to our shareholders.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control that may be favored by some shareholders.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or other change of control transaction that shareholders may consider favorable. These provisions may also make it more difficult for our shareholders to change our Board of Directors and senior management. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include a limited right of shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders; rules regulating how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at annual meetings of shareholders; and authorization for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series, without shareholder approval. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our Board of Directors. This provision of Delaware law may discourage takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for shares of our common stock.\nIn addition, several of our agreements with local telephone service providers require their consent to any assignment by us of our rights and obligations under the agreements. The consent rights in these agreements might discourage, delay or prevent a transaction that a shareholder may consider favorable.", "PERMNO": 93240, "SIC": 7310, "TIC": "DXMMQ"}
