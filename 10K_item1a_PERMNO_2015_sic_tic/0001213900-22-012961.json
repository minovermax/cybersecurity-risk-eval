RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following material risk factors and other information in this report. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects for growth could be seriously impacted. As a result, the trading price, if any, of our Common Stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisk Factors Related to the Commodities Trading Business\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to manage the commodities trading business effectively.\nOperating the commodities trading business is a significant challenge and there is no assurance that we will be able to manage the integration successfully. If we are unable to efficiently integrate these businesses, the attention of our management could be diverted from our existing operations and the ability of the management teams at these business units to meet operational and financial expectations could be adversely impacted, which could impair our ability to execute our business plans. Failure to successfully integrate the new commodities trading business or to realize the expected benefits of entry into the business may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nInvestment in our new line of business could disrupt the Company\u2019s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated.\nWe have deployed a significant amount of proceeds from our financings in our new commodities business line, Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng. New ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. In evaluating such endeavors, we are required to make difficult judgments regarding the value of business strategies, opportunities, technologies and other assets, and the risks and cost of potential liabilities. Furthermore, these investments involve certain other risks and uncertainties, including the risks involved with entering new competitive categories or regions, the difficulty in integrating the new business, the challenges in achieving strategic objectives and other benefits expected from our investment, the diversion of our attention and resources from our operations and other initiatives, the potential impairment of acquired assets and liabilities and the performance of underlying products, capabilities or technologies.\nWe may not be able to ensure the successful implementation of our strategy to diversify our businesses.\nWe have entered into the commodities trading business. Such initiatives involve various risks including but not limited to the investment costs in establishing a distribution network within the PRC, leasing warehouses, offices and other working capital requirements. There is no assurance that such future plans can be successfully implemented as the successful execution of such future plans will depend on several factors, some of which are not within our control, such as retaining and recruiting qualified and skilled staff, and the continued demand for our products by our customers. Failure to implement any part of our future plans or executing such plan costs effectively, may lead to a material adverse change in our operating environment or affect our ability to respond to market or industry changes, which may, in turn, adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe expect that we will require additional debt and equity capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges and/or unforeseen circumstances. If such capital is not available to us, or is not available on favorable terms, our business, operating results and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe expect that we will require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges and/or unforeseen circumstances, including to increase our marketing expenditures in order to improve our brand awareness, build our non-ferrous metal inventory, develop new customers, enhance our operating infrastructure and acquire complementary technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity, debt or other types of financings to secure additional funds. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any debt financing that we secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities.\nVolatility in the credit markets may also have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt financing. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of our Common Stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to pursue our business objectives and to respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly limited, and our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends substantially upon the continued retention of our senior management.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of certain members of our senior management, including Ms. Renmei Ouyang, our Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Tianshi Yang, our Chief Financial Officer. These officers play an integral role in determining our strategic direction and for executing our growth strategy and are important to our brand and culture. The loss of the services of any of these executives without qualified replacement could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects, as we may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace them on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, any such departure could be viewed negatively by investors and analysts, which could cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline.\nOur business depends on adequate supply and availability of nonferrous metal commodities.\nOur planned business requires nonferrous metal commodities that are sourced from third party suppliers. We are affected by industry supply conditions, which generally involve risks beyond our control, including costs of these materials, transportation costs and market demand. As a result, we may not be able to obtain an adequate supply of quality nonferrous metal commodities in a timely or cost-effective manner, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue and profits from our supply chain management services from a small number of clients, and adverse industry trends or the loss of one or more of any of those clients could significantly damage our business.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from our supply chain management services to a small number of clients. Our business and future growth will continue to depend in large part on the industry trend towards outsourcing supply chain management and other business processes. If these trends do not continue or decline, demand for our supply chain management services will decline, and our financial results could suffer.\nIn addition, the loss of a significant amount of business or program with any key client could cause our revenue and or profits to decline and our financial results could suffer.\nThe supply chain management services segment of our business is expected to continue to derive the vast majority of its net revenue and or profits from sales to a small number of key clients. In general, we do not have any agreements which obligate any client to buy a minimum amount of services from us, or to designate us as its sole supplier of any particular services. If any of our key clients fail to respond successfully to market shifts, we would be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that our revenue and or profits from key clients will not decline in future periods.\nA decline in our key business sectors or a reduction in consumer demand generally could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA large portion of our supply chain management services revenue comes from clients in the energy, material and industrial sectors, which is intensely competitive, very volatile, and subject to rapid changes and fluctuations in the overall economic conditions. Declines in the overall performance of the energy, material and industrial sectors have in the past and could in the future, adversely affect the demand for our supply chain management services and reduce our revenue and profitability from these clients. In addition, industry changes, such as the transition of more collateral materials from physical form to digital form and changes in marketing channels, could lessen the demand for certain of our services we currently handle. To the extent recent uncertainty in the economy or other factors result in decreased demand for our clients\u2019 products, we may experience a reduction in volumes of client products that we handle which could have a material adverse effect on our supply chain management services business, financial position and operating results.\nWe operate in a business that is cyclical and where demand can be volatile, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe operate in a business that is cyclical and where demand can be volatile, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The timing and magnitude of the cycles in the business in which we operate are difficult to predict. Purchase prices for the raw materials we purchase, and selling prices for our products are volatile and beyond our control. While we attempt to respond to changing raw material costs through adjustments to the sales price of our products, our ability to do so is limited by competitive and other market factors. A significant reduction in selling prices for our products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and adversely impact our ability to recover purchase costs from end customers. A decline in market prices for our products between the date of the sales order and shipment of the product may impact the customer\u2019s ability to obtain letters of credit to cover the full sales amount. A decline in selling prices for our products coupled with customers failing to meet their contractual obligations may also result in a net realizable value adjustment to the average cost of inventory to reflect the lower of cost or fair market value. Additionally, changing prices could potentially impact the volume of raw materials available to us, the volume of ore and processed metal sold by us and inventory levels. The cyclical nature of our businesses tends to reflect and be amplified by changes in general economic conditions, both domestically and internationally.\nWe expect that we will require additional debt and equity capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges and/or unforeseen circumstances. If such capital is not available to us, or is not available on favorable terms, our business, operating results and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe expect that we will require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges and/or unforeseen circumstances, including to increase our marketing expenditures in order to improve our brand awareness, develop new products or services or further improve existing services, enhance our operating infrastructure and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity, debt or other types of financings to secure additional funds. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any debt financing that we secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities.\nVolatility in the credit markets may also have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt financing. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of our Common Stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to pursue our business objectives and to respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly limited, and our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.\nRisk Factors Related to Our General Operations\nThe current geographic concentration where we provide services creates an exposure to local economies, regional downturns or severe weather or catastrophic occurrences that may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently conduct our commodities trading business in Shenzhen. We currently hold all our commodities inventory at our warehouse in Foshan. While we have insurance to cover certain losses on those commodities, events such as theft, fire, flood, or hail could adversely impact our business.\nIn addition, our business is currently more susceptible to regional conditions than the operations of more geographically diversified competitors, and we are vulnerable to economic downturns in those regions. Any unforeseen events or circumstances that negatively affect these areas could materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability. These factors include, among other things, changes in demographics and population. In addition, severe weather conditions, acts of God and other catastrophic occurrences in the area in which we operate or from which we obtain inventory may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Such conditions may result in physical damage to our properties and loss of inventory. Any of these factors may disrupt our business and materially adversely affect our financial condition and result of operations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully replicate our business model and achieve levels of success as we enter new geographic markets.\nOur failure to maintain a reputation of integrity and to otherwise maintain and enhance our brand could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business model is based on our ability to provide customers with commodities trading that we believe will save them time and money. If we fail to build and maintain a positive reputation, or if an event occurs that damages this reputation, it could adversely affect consumer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Even the perception of a decrease in the quality of our brand could negatively impact results.\nComplaints or negative publicity about our business practices, marketing and advertising campaigns, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the integrity of the data that we provide to users, and other aspects of our business, especially on industry-specific blogs and social media websites, and irrespective of their validity, could diminish consumer confidence in our services and adversely affect our brand. The growing use of social media increases the speed with which information and opinions can be shared and, thus, the speed with which reputation can be affected. If we fail to correct or mitigate misinformation or negative information, including information spread through social media or traditional media channels, about us, the vehicles we offer, our customer experience, or any aspect of our brand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property, technology and confidential information could harm our business and operating results.\nOur business depends on our intellectual property, technology and confidential information, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property, technology and confidential information by requiring certain of our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality agreements and certain third parties to enter into nondisclosure agreements. In addition, these agreements may not effectively prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property or technology and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property, or technology. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our website features, software and functionality or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary. Changes in the law or adverse court rulings may also negatively affect our ability to prevent others from using our technology.\nWe may be subject to claims asserting that our employees, consultants or advisors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their current or former employees or claims asserting ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nAlthough we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and advisors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these individuals or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such individual\u2019s current or former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIn addition, while we intend to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. The assignment of intellectual property may not be self-executing or the assignment agreement may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nWe may in the future be subject to intellectual property disputes, which are costly to defend and could harm our business and operating results.\nWe may, from time to time, face allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. We may be unaware of the intellectual property rights that others may claim cover some or all of our technology or services. Patent and other intellectual property litigation may be protracted and expensive, the results are difficult to predict and may require us to stop offering some features, purchase licenses or modify our products and features while we develop non-infringing substitutes or may result in significant settlement costs.\nEven if these matters do not result in litigation, are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, these matters, and the time and resources necessary to litigate or resolve them, could harm our business, our operating results and our reputation.\nWe may be subject to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. If the outcomes of these proceedings are adverse to us, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to various litigation matters from time to time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law could be asserted against us by individuals, either individually or through class actions, by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations, and proceedings or by other entities. These claims could be asserted under a variety of laws, including but not limited to consumer finance laws, consumer protection laws, intellectual property laws, privacy laws, labor and employment laws, securities laws and employee benefit laws. These actions could expose us to adverse publicity and to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs, injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties, including but not limited to suspension or revocation of licenses to conduct business.\nIn the event we are not able to get refund from Harrison Fund, we will suffer significant losses.\nIn May 2019, the Company invested an aggregate of $1,000,000 to purchase financial products from Harrison Fund, LLC (\u201cHarrison Fund\u201d), a private equity fund, for investment return. On April 6, 2020, we filed a law suit against Harrison Fund in California seeking the full refund of the $1,000,000 investment because we identified problematic information in Harrison Fund\u2019s brochure. Based on the current stage of the proceedings in this case, the outcome of this legal proceeding, including the anticipated legal costs, remains uncertain. Therefore, we recorded a full investment impairment loss of $1,000,000, which was reflected in the consolidated statements of operation and comprehensive income (loss). We may incur significant legal fees, settlements or damages awards resulting from this or other civil litigation. If this matter is not resolved in our favor, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nFailure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which generally prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have implemented these policies through our Code of Conduct. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in China. While we make every effort to comply with FCPA and our company Code of Conduct, we can make no assurance that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that will likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and we cannot provide assurances that these weaknesses will be effectively remediated or that additional material weaknesses will not occur in the future. If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and which may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nAs discussed in \u201cPart II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures,\u201d our management has identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which were not remediated as of December 31, 2021. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the registrant\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, we are re-assessing the design of our controls and modifying processes. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully remediate our existing material weaknesses or that our internal control over financial reporting will not suffer in the future from other material weaknesses, thus making us unable to prevent or detect on a timely basis material misstatement in our periodic reports with the SEC. If we fail to remediate these material weaknesses or otherwise maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, the existence of one or more internal control deficiencies could result in errors in our financial statements, and substantial costs and resources may be required to rectify internal control deficiencies. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, we may have difficulty in filing timely periodic reports with the SEC, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, the market price of our stock could decline significantly, we may be unable to obtain additional financing to operate and expand our business, and our business and financial condition could be materially harmed. In addition, any failure to remediate the existing material weaknesses or a failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, subject us to potential litigation and regulatory inquiry and cause us to incur additional costs in future periods relating to the implementation of remedial measures.\nMatters relating to or arising from the restatements, Audit Committee investigation and the associated material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting, including adverse publicity, have caused us to incur significant legal, accounting and other professional fees and other costs, have exposed us to greater risks associated with other civil litigation, regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions, have diverted resources and attention that would otherwise be directed toward our operations and implementation of our business strategy and may impact our ability to attract and retain customers, employees and vendors, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Corporate Structure\nThe failure to comply with PRC regulations relating to mergers and acquisitions of domestic enterprises by offshore special purpose vehicles may subject us to severe fines or penalties and create other regulatory uncertainties regarding our corporate structure.\nOn August 8, 2006, MOFCOM, joined by the CSRC, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, the SAT, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (the \u201cSAIC\u201d), and SAFE, jointly promulgated regulations entitled the Provisions Regarding Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors (the \u201cM&A Rules\u201d), which took effect as of September 8, 2006, and as amended on June 22, 2009. This regulation, among other things, has certain provisions that require offshore special purpose vehicles formed for the purpose of acquiring PRC domestic companies and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC individuals and companies, to obtain the approval of MOFCOM prior to engaging in such acquisitions and to obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to publicly listing their securities on an overseas stock market. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published on its official website a notice specifying the documents and materials that are required to be submitted for obtaining CSRC approval.\nThe application of the M&A Rules with respect to our corporate structure remains unclear, with no current consensus existing among leading PRC law firms regarding the scope and applicability of the M&A Rules. We believe that the MOFCOM and CSRC approvals under the M&A Rules were not required in the context of our share exchange transaction because at such time the share exchange was a foreign related transaction governed by foreign laws, not subject to the jurisdiction of PRC laws and regulations. However, we cannot be certain that the relevant PRC government agencies, including the CSRC and MOFCOM, would reach the same conclusion, and we cannot be certain that MOFCOM or the CSRC will not deem that the transactions effected by the share exchange circumvented the M&A Rules, and other rules and notices, or that prior MOFCOM or CSRC approval is required for overseas financing. Further, we cannot rule out the possibility that the relevant PRC government agencies, including MOFCOM, would deem that the M&A Rules required us or our entities in China to obtain approval from MOFCOM or other PRC regulatory agencies in connection with Hao Limo\u2019s control of Beijing Tianxing through contractual arrangements.\nIf the CSRC, MOFCOM, or another PRC regulatory agency subsequently determines that CSRC, MOFCOM or other approval was required for the share exchange transaction and/or the VIE arrangements between Hao Limo and Beijing Tianxing, or if prior CSRC approval for overseas financings is required and not obtained, we may face severe regulatory actions or other sanctions from MOFCOM, the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies. In such event, these regulatory agencies may impose fines or other penalties on our operations in the PRC, limit our operating privileges in the PRC, delay or restrict the repatriation of the proceeds from overseas financings into the PRC, restrict or prohibit payment or remittance of dividends to us or take other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects, as well as the trading price of our Common Stock. The CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies may also take actions requiring us, or making it advisable for us, to delay or cancel overseas financings, to restructure our current corporate structure, or to seek regulatory approvals that may be difficult or costly to obtain.\nThe M&A Rules, along with certain foreign exchange regulations discussed below, will be interpreted or implemented by the relevant government authorities in connection with our future offshore financings or acquisitions, and we cannot predict how they will affect our acquisition strategy. For example, Beijing Tianxing\u2019s ability to remit its profits to us, or to engage in foreign-currency-denominated borrowings, may be conditioned upon compliance with the SAFE registration requirements by such Chinese domestic residents, over whom we may have no control.\nRegulations relating to offshore investment activities by PRC residents may limit our ability to acquire PRC companies and could adversely affect our business.\nIn July 2014, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration over the Overseas Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment by Domestic Residents via Special Purpose Vehicles, or Circular 37, which replaced Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents\u2019 Corporate Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Offshore Special Purpose Vehicles, or Circular 75. Circular 37 requires PRC residents to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, referred to in Circular 37 as a \u201cspecial purpose vehicle\u201d for the purpose of holding domestic or offshore assets or interests. Circular 37 further requires amendment to a PRC resident\u2019s registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as an increase or decrease in the capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. Under these regulations, PRC residents\u2019 failure to comply with specified registration procedures may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant PRC entity, including the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore parent, as well as restrictions on capital inflows from the offshore entity to the PRC entity, including restrictions on its ability to contribute additional capital to its PRC subsidiaries. Further, failure to comply with the SAFE registration requirements could result in penalties under PRC law for evasion of foreign exchange regulations.\nAs Circular 37 is newly-issued, it is unclear how these regulations will be interpreted and implemented. In addition, different local SAFE branches may have different views and procedures as to the interpretation and implementation of the SAFE regulations, and it may be difficult for our ultimate shareholders or beneficial owners who are PRC residents to provide sufficient supporting documents required by the SAFE or to complete the required registration with the SAFE in a timely manner, or at all. Any failure by any of our shareholders who is a PRC resident, or is controlled by a PRC resident, to comply with relevant requirements under these regulations could subject us to fines or sanctions imposed by the PRC government.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nIf We have not been in compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s requirements for continued listing and our common stock may be delisted from trading on Nasdaq, which would have a material effect on us and our stockholders.\nIf We were delinquent in the filing of our periodic reports with the SEC, we will not be in compliance with listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires timely filing of periodic financial reports with the SEC. Under Nasdaq\u2019s listing rules, we would be permitted to submit to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules. However there can be no guarantee that Nasdaq will accept our compliance plan, grant us the extension or that we will be able to file by the extended compliance period, in which case our common stock may be subject to delisting by Nasdaq. If our common stock is delisted, there can no assurance whether or when it would be listed for trading on Nasdaq or any other exchange. If our common stock is delisted, the market price of our shares will likely decline and become more volatile, and our stockholders may find that their ability to trade in our stock will be adversely affected. Furthermore, institutions whose charters do not allow them to hold securities in unlisted companies might sell our shares, which could have a further adverse effect on the price of our stock.\nThe delayed filing of some of our periodic reports has made us currently ineligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 to register the offer and sale of securities, which could adversely affect our ability to raise future capital or complete acquisitions.\nAs a result of the delayed filing of some of our periodic reports with the SEC, we will not be eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on Form S-3 until 12 months after the delinquent filings have been made. Should we wish to register the offer and sale of our securities to the public prior to the time we are eligible to use Form S-3, both our transaction costs and the amount of time required to complete the transaction could increase, making it more difficult to execute any such transaction successfully and potentially harming our financial condition.\nAs a result of the delayed filings, we are also in breach of the common stock purchase agreement with White Lion Capital, LLC as the prospectus supplement dated January 19, 2021 registering up to 15,800,000 shares of our common stock is no longer eligible for use. Pursuant to the terms of the common stock purchase agreement, White Lion Capital, LLC will be entitled to injunctive relief as well as specific performance due to our breach of the agreement. Claim from White Lion may result in legal expenses, diversion of management attention, as well as possible damages which may negatively affect our financial condition.\nWe do not expect to declare or pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not expect to declare or pay dividends in the foreseeable future, as we anticipate that we will invest future earnings in the development and growth of our business. Therefore, holders of our Common Stock will not receive any return on their investment unless they sell their securities, and holders may be unable to sell their securities on favorable terms or at all.\nFuture issuances of our Common Stock or securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, our Common Stock (\u201cSecurities\u201d), or the expiration of lock-up agreements that restrict the issuance of new Common Stock or the trading of outstanding Common Stock, could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline and would result in the dilution of your holdings.\nFuture issuances of our Securities, or the expiration of lock-up agreements that restrict the issuance of new Common Stock or the trading of outstanding Common Stock, could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline. We cannot predict the effect, if any, of future issuances of our Securities, or the future expirations of lock-up agreements, on the price of our Common Stock. In all events, future issuances of our Common Stock would result in the dilution of your holdings. In addition, the perception that new issuances of our Securities could occur, or the perception that locked-up parties will sell their securities when the lock-ups expire, could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. In addition to any adverse effects that may arise upon the expiration of these lock-up agreements, the lock-up provisions in these agreements may be waived, at any time and without notice. If the restrictions under the lock-up agreements are waived, our Common Stock may become available for resale, subject to applicable law, including without notice, which could reduce the market price for our Common Stock.\nThe Company has outstanding warrants having a \u201ccashless exercise\u201d feature and may cause dilution to existing stockholders.\nAs part of its Registered Direct Offerings in 2019, the Company issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2,760,000 shares of common stock. The warrants have a cashless exercise feature giving the holders the option of exercising the warrants on a cashless basis if there is no effective registration statement covering the common stock issuable upon exercise of these warrants. If the warrant shares are issued in such a cashless exercise, the warrant shares will take on the characteristics of the warrants being exercised, and the holding period of the warrant shares being issued may be tacked on to the holding period of the warrants in accordance with Section 3(a)(9).\nThe Company would not receive any proceeds from the exercise of warrants issued to the holder in such a cashless exercise, causing dilution to existing stockholders with no corresponding influx of capital. This may affect our ability to raise additional equity capital.\nOur Common Stock may be thinly traded and our stockholders may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if they need to sell their shares to raise money or otherwise desire to liquidate their shares.\nOur Common Stock may be \u201cthinly-traded\u201d, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our Common Stock at or near bid prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation may be attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company which is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and might be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we became more seasoned. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. Broad or active public trading market for our Common Stock may not develop or be sustained.\nThe market price for our Common Stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as:\n\u25cf the perception of U.S. investors and regulators of U.S. listed Chinese companies;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts;\n\u25cf negative publicity, studies or reports;\n\u25cf changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other microcredit companies;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf addition or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf fluctuations of exchange rates between RMB and the U.S. dollar; and\n\u25cf general economic or political conditions in China.\nIn addition, the securities market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nVolatility in our Common Stock price may subject us to securities litigation.\nThe market for our Common Stock may have, when compared to seasoned issuers, significant price volatility and we expect that our share price may continue to be more volatile than that of a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may, in the future, be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nProvisions in our By-laws and Delaware laws might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our Common Stock.\nProvisions of our by-laws and Delaware laws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our Common Stock. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions include:\n\u25cf the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings;\n\u25cf the ability of our board of directors to make, alter or repeal our by-laws; and\n\u25cf the ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless such transactions are approved by our board of directors. The existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your Common Stock in an acquisition.\nThe elimination of monetary liability against our directors, officers and employees under our certificate of incorporation and the existence of indemnification of our directors, officers and employees under Delaware law may result in substantial expenditures by us and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers and employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation contains provisions which eliminate the liability of our directors for monetary damages to us and our stockholders to the maximum extent permitted under the corporate laws of Delaware. We may also provide contractual indemnification obligations under agreements with our directors, officers and employees. These indemnification obligations could result in our incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors, officers and employees, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resultant costs may also discourage us from bringing a lawsuit against directors, officers and employees for breach of their fiduciary duties, and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our shareholders against our directors, officers and employees even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit the Company and our shareholders.\nIf we fail to meet the requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock could be delisted from trading.\nOur common stock is currently listed for quotation on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We are required to meet specified financial requirements in order to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nThe minimum bid price per share of us common shares has been below $1.00 for a period of 30 consecutive business days and we therefore no longer meet the minimum bid price requirements set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). We haven\u2019t until February 28, 2022 to regain compliance, we must prove to be eligible for an additional 180 calendar days that we meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for Nasdaq except for Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). On March 1, 2022, we have received notice from Nasdaq indicating that, while we have not regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, the Staff of Nasdaq has determined that the Company is eligible for an additional 180 calendar day period, or until August 29, 2022, to regain compliance. If we don\u2019 t regain compliance until August 29, 2022, Nasdaq will provide notice that our common stock will be subject to delisting from trading.\nWe are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our Common Stock.\nWe will be required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for fiscal 2014, the first fiscal year beginning after our initial public offering. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting and, after we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d a statement that our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an opinion on our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe are in the early stages of the costly and challenging process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404. We may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective.\nIf we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if, when required, our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our Common Stock to decline, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC.\nWe will be required to disclose changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis.\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by global public health epidemics, including the strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19.\nIn light of the uncertain and rapidly evolving situation relating to the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19), we have taken temporary precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, our customers, and the communities in which we participate, which could negatively impact our business. To this end, we are evaluating alternative working arrangements, including requiring all employees to work remotely, and we have suspended all non-essential travel for our employees and limiting in-person work-related meetings.\nIn addition, with the extended Chinese business shutdowns that resulted from the outbreak of COVID-19, we may experience delays or the inability to service our customers on a timely basis in our commodities trading business. The disruptions to our supply chain and business operations, or to our suppliers\u2019 or customers\u2019 supply chains and business operations, could include disruptions from the closure of our interruptions in the supply of commodities, personnel absences, and delivery and storage of commodities, any of which could have adverse ripple effects on our commodities trading business. If we need to close any of our facilities or a critical number of our employees become too ill to work, our ability to provide our products and services to our customers could be materially adversely affected in a rapid manner. Similarly, if our customers experience adverse business consequences due to COVID-19, or any other pandemic, demand for our products and services could also be materially adversely affected in a rapid manner. Global health concerns, such as COVID-19, could also result in social, economic, and labor instability in the localities in which we or our suppliers and customers operate within China.\nWhile the potential economic impact brought by and the duration of COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, a widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock. While it is too early to tell whether COVID-19 will have a material effect on our business over time, we continue to monitor the situation as it unfolds. The extent to which COVID-19 affects our results will depend on many factors and future developments, including new information about COVID-19 and any new government regulations which may emerge to contain the virus, among others.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in China\nChanges in China\u2019s economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nSubstantially all of our assets and operations are located in the PRC. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be influenced to a significant degree by political, economic and social conditions in the PRC generally. The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the level of government involvement, development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. Although the Chinese government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets, and the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in the PRC is still owned by the government. In addition, the Chinese government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. The Chinese government also exercises significant control over the PRC\u2019s economic growth through allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.\nWhile the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth over past decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. Any adverse changes in economic conditions in the PRC, in the policies of the Chinese government or in the laws and regulations in the PRC could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of the PRC. Such developments could adversely affect our business and operating results, lead to a reduction in demand for our services and adversely affect our competitive position. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations. In addition, in the past the Chinese government has implemented certain measures, including interest rate adjustment, to control the pace of economic growth. These measures may cause decreased economic activity in the PRC, which may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nUncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could adversely affect us.\nThe PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike the common law system, prior court decisions under the civil law system may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value.\nIn 1979, the PRC government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and regulations governing economic matters generally. The overall effect of legislation over the past three decades has significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in the PRC. However, the PRC has not developed a fully integrated legal system, and recently enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in the PRC. In particular, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve uncertainties. Since PRC administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory provisions and contractual terms, it may be difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy. These uncertainties may affect our judgment on the relevance of legal requirements and our ability to enforce our contractual rights or tort claims. In addition, these regulatory uncertainties may be exploited through unmerited or frivolous legal actions or threats in attempts to extract payments or benefits from us.\nFurthermore, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all and may have a retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of any of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation. In addition, any administrative and court proceedings in the PRC may be protracted, resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.\nFluctuations in exchange rates could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment.\nThe value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions and the foreign exchange policy adopted by the PRC government. It is difficult to predict how long such appreciation of RMB against the U.S. dollar may last and when and how the relationship between the RMB and the U.S. dollar may change again. All of our revenues and substantially all of our costs are denominated in Renminbi. We rely on dividends paid by our operating subsidiaries in China for our cash needs. Any significant revaluation of Renminbi may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position reported in Renminbi when translated into U.S. dollars, and the value of, and any dividends payable on, the common stock in U.S. dollars. To the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the Renminbi amount we would receive. Conversely, if we decide to convert our Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on our common stock or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount.\nU.S. regulatory bodies may be limited in their ability to conduct investigations or inspections of our operations in China.\nAny disclosure of documents or information located in China by foreign agencies may be subject to jurisdiction constraints and must comply with China\u2019s state secrecy laws, which broadly define the scope of \u201cstate secrets\u201d to include matters involving economic interests and technologies. There is no guarantee that requests from U.S. federal or state regulators or agencies to investigate or inspect our operations will be honored by us, by entities who provide services to us or with whom we associate, without violating PRC legal requirements, especially as those entities are located in China. Furthermore, under the current PRC laws, an on-site inspection of our facilities by any of these regulators may be limited or prohibited.", "PERMNO": 14093, "SIC": 6159, "TIC": "GLG"}
