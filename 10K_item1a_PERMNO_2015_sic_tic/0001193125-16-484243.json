{"cik": "1022646", "company": "ULTRA PETROLEUM CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe have significant indebtedness. Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If we are unable to comply with the financial and non-financial covenants governing our indebtedness or obtain waivers of any defaults that occur with respect to our indebtedness, or amend, replace or refinance any or all of the agreements governing our indebtedness and/or otherwise secure additional capital, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nAt February 29, 2016, we had the following obligations outstanding under our Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 5), our 2018 Notes (as defined in Note 5), our 2024 Notes (as defined in Note 5), and our Senior Notes (maturity dates exclude the effect of the default provisions described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements):\n\u2022\n$999.0 million due October 2016 under the Credit Agreement;\n\u2022\n$450.0 million due December 2018 with respect to the 2018 Notes;\n\u2022\n$850.0 million due October 2024 with respect to the 2024 Notes; and\n\u2022\n$1.46 billion due between March 2016 and October 2025 with respect to the Senior Notes (see Note 5 for maturity details).\nOur indebtedness affects our operations in several ways, including;\n\u2022\na significant portion of our cash flows from operating activities must be used to service our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nthe covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness limit or in the future may limit our ability to borrow additional funds, pay dividends on our common stock, make certain investments and affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry;\n\u2022\nwe may be at a competitive disadvantage as compared to similar companies that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nfuture financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes may have higher costs and more restrictive covenants or may not be available at all.\nIn addition, the terms of our indebtedness, including the covenants and the dates on which principal and interest payments on our indebtedness are due, increases the risk that we will be unable to continue as a going concern. To continue as a going concern over the next twelve months, we must make payments on our debt as they come due and comply with the covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness or, if we fail to do so, to (i) negotiate and obtain waivers of or forbearances with respect to any defaults that occur with respect to our indebtedness, (ii) amend, replace, refinance or restructure any or all of the agreements governing our indebtedness, including our Credit Agreement, the Master Note Purchase Agreement (as defined in Note 5) related to the Senior Notes, and/or the indentures related to our 2018 Notes and our 2024 Notes, and/or (iii) otherwise secure additional capital. However, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in accomplishing any of these plans, and if we were unable to do so or to otherwise obtain sufficient liquidity to repay the outstanding indebtedness and to meet our operating needs, it may be necessary for us to seek protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (\u201cChapter 11\u201d) or the Canadian Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, or an involuntary petition for bankruptcy may be filed against us in the U.S. or in Canada.\nThe audit report we received with respect to our year-end 2015 consolidated financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a \u201cgoing concern.\u201d Our Credit Agreement requires us to deliver audited, consolidated financial statements without a \u201cgoing concern\u201d or like qualification or exception. As a result, unless we obtain a waiver of this requirement, subject to a 30-day grace period, we will be in default under our Credit Agreement after we deliver our financial statements to the lenders under the Credit Agreement. Our failure to obtain a waiver of this requirement under the Credit Agreement within the applicable grace period could result in an acceleration of all of our outstanding debt obligations and the potential termination of the Pinedale Lease Agreement.\nUnder our Credit Agreement, we are required to deliver audited, consolidated financial statements without a \u201cgoing concern\u201d or like qualification or explanation. Because the audit report prepared by our auditors with respect to the financial statements in this Form 10-K includes an explanatory paragraph expressing uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a \u201cgoing concern,\u201d we will be in default under the Credit Agreement on March 15, 2016 when we deliver our financial statements to the lenders under the Credit Agreement. There is a 30-day grace period related to this covenant in the Credit Agreement. We are currently in discussions with these lenders regarding a waiver of this requirement. If we do not obtain a waiver or other suitable relief from the lenders under the Credit Agreement before the expiration of the 30-day grace period, there will exist an event of default under the Credit Agreement.\nIf an event of default occurs under our Credit Agreement, the lenders could accelerate the loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement and deny any additional borrowing requests we might submit pursuant to the Credit Agreement. In addition, if the lenders under our Credit Agreement accelerate the loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement, we will then also be in default under the Master Note Purchase Agreement and the indentures related to our 2018 Notes and our 2024 Notes. If we default under the Master Note Purchase Agreement, the holders of the Senior Notes could accelerate the Senior Notes. Likewise, if we default under the indentures, the holders of the 2018 Notes or the 2024 Notes could accelerate those notes.\nIf our lenders or our noteholders accelerate the payment of amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement, the Senior Notes, the 2018 Notes or the 2024 Notes, respectively, we do not currently have sufficient liquidity to repay such indebtedness and would need additional sources of capital to do so. We could attempt to obtain additional sources of capital from asset sales, public or private issuances of debt, equity or equity-linked securities, debt for equity swaps, or any combination thereof. However, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in obtaining capital from such transactions on acceptable terms, or at all, and if we fail to obtain sufficient additional capital to repay the outstanding indebtedness and provide sufficient liquidity to meet our operating needs, it may be necessary for us to seek protection from creditors under Chapter 11 or the Canadian Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, or an involuntary petition for bankruptcy may be filed against us in the U.S. or in Canada.\nIn addition, if $100.0 million or more of our debt obligations are accelerated, the lessor under our Pinedale Lease Agreement could terminate the Pinedale Lease Agreement. A termination of the Pinedale Lease Agreement would significantly disrupt our ability to produce oil and gas from Pinedale field which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThere are covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness. In many instances, a default under one of the agreements governing our indebtedness can, if not cured or waived, result in a default under certain of our other indebtedness agreements and/or the Pinedale Lease Agreement. A default on our obligations, an acceleration of our indebtedness by our lenders or noteholders, and/or a termination of the Pinedale Lease Agreement, as applicable, would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our securities.\nOur Credit Agreement contains a consolidated leverage covenant, pursuant to which Ultra Resources is required to maintain a maximum ratio of its total funded consolidated debt to its trailing four fiscal quarters\u2019 EBITDAX of 3.5 to 1.0, and a PV-9 covenant, pursuant to which Ultra Resources is required to maintain a minimum ratio of the discounted net present value of its oil and gas properties to its total funded consolidated debt of 1.5 to 1.0. We are required to report whether we are in compliance with the consolidated leverage ratio after the end of each fiscal quarter, and we are required to report whether we are in compliance with the PV-9 ratio by April 1 after the end of each fiscal year.\nBased on our EBITDAX for the trailing four fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the consolidated leverage covenant at December 31, 2015 (the ratio was 3.37 to 1.00 at December 31, 2015). However, based on our estimates of forward commodity prices and our most recent production forecasts, we expect to breach the consolidated leverage ratio covenant for the trailing four fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2016. In addition, based on the net present value of our oil and gas properties and the total funded consolidated debt of the borrower under the Credit Agreement, each at December 31, 2015, we expect to breach the PV-9 ratio when we report whether we are in compliance on April 1, 2016. A violation of this covenant can become an event of default under our debt agreements and result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness.\nThe Master Note Purchase Agreement contains a consolidated leverage covenant similar to the consolidated leverage covenant in our Credit Agreement. Based on our EBITDAX for the trailing four fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with this covenant at December 31, 2015. However, based on our estimates of forward commodity prices and our most recent production forecasts, we expect to breach the consolidated leverage covenant for the trailing four fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2016. A violation of this covenant can become an event of default under our debt agreements and result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness.\nThe indentures related to our 2018 Notes and our 2024 Notes contain an interest charge coverage ratio, pursuant to which we are required to maintain a minimum ratio of our trailing four fiscal quarters\u2019 consolidated EBITDA to our total interest expense of no less than 2.25 to 1.00 as a precondition to our incurring additional indebtedness. Based on our EBITDA for the trailing four fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with this covenant at December 31, 2015. However, if commodity prices stay at or decline from recent levels or if we fail to develop new properties and operate our existing properties profitably or if our interest expense increases due to changes in the agreements governing our indebtedness or due to breaches of the covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness, we may not be able to continue to comply with this covenant during the next twelve months. If we breach this covenant, our ability to incur additional indebtedness will be limited, or we may not be able to incur additional indebtedness at all.\nIf our lenders or our noteholders accelerate the payment of amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement, the Senior Notes, the 2018 Notes or the 2024 Notes, respectively, we do not currently have sufficient liquidity to repay such indebtedness and would need additional sources of capital to do so. We could attempt to\nobtain additional sources of capital from asset sales, public or private issuances of debt, equity or equity-linked securities, debt for equity swaps, or any combination thereof. However, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in obtaining capital from such transactions on acceptable terms, or at all, and if we were unable to obtain sufficient additional capital to repay the outstanding indebtedness and sufficient liquidity to meet our operating needs, it may be necessary for us to seek protection from creditors under Chapter 11 or the Canadian Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, or an involuntary petition for bankruptcy may be filed against us in the U.S. or in Canada.\nIn addition, if $100.0 million or more of our debt obligations are accelerated, the lessor under our Pinedale Lease Agreement could terminate the Pinedale Lease Agreement. A termination of the Pinedale Lease Agreement would significantly disrupt our ability to produce oil and gas from Pinedale field which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe have no borrowing capacity under our Credit Agreement. Unless we are able to successfully restructure our existing indebtedness, obtain waivers or forbearance from our existing lenders or otherwise raise significant capital, it is unlikely that we will be able to meet our obligations as they become due, and we may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nOver the periods presented in the accompanying financial statements, our growth has been funded through a combination of borrowings under the agreements governing our indebtedness, the sale of assets and cash flows from operating activities. We currently have limited access to additional capital. We recently borrowed $266.0 million under our Credit Agreement, which represented substantially all of the remaining undrawn amount under the Credit Agreement.\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. As a result of losses incurred and our current negative working capital, there is no assurance that the carrying amounts of assets will be realized or that liabilities will be settled for the amounts recorded. Unless we are able to successfully restructure our existing indebtedness, obtain waivers or forbearance from our existing lenders or otherwise raise significant additional capital, it is unlikely that we will be able to meet our obligations as they become due, and we may not be able to continue as a going concern. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to restructure our existing indebtedness, obtain further waivers or forbearance from our existing lenders or otherwise raise significant additional capital.\nIf we cannot obtain sufficient capital when needed, we will not be able to continue with our historical business strategy.\nOur business strategy has historically included maintaining a portfolio of properties that provide long-term, profitable growth through development in areas that support sustainable, lower-risk, repeatable, high-return drilling projects. In the future, we may not be able to obtain financing in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms when needed, which could adversely affect our operating results and prospects. If we cannot raise the capital required to implement our historical business strategy, we may be required to curtail operations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations could be adversely affected if we fail to maintain required bonds.\nFederal and state laws require bonds or cash deposits to secure our obligations with respect to various parts of our operations. Our failure to maintain, or inability to acquire, bonds that are required by state and federal law would have a material adverse effect on us. That failure could result from a variety of factors including: our failure to comply with rules and regulations of Federal and state governmental agencies, including the United States Bureau of Land Management, the lack of availability of bonding, higher expense or unfavorable market terms of new bonds; and the exercise by third-party bond issuers of their right to refuse to renew the bonds. If we fail to maintain required bonds, our production may significantly decrease, which would significantly decrease our already constrained cash flow.\nWe may fail to comply with the standards for the continued listing of our common stock for trading on the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d). If we fail to comply with these continued listing standards, our common shares may be delisted from the NYSE which could result in reductions to the price of our common stock and would make it more difficult to trade our common stock.\nSince August 2007, our common stock has been listed for trading on the NYSE. The continued listing of our common shares on the NYSE is subject to our compliance with a number of listing standards. To maintain compliance with these continued listing standards, we are required to maintain an average closing per share price of $1.00 or more over a consecutive 30 trading-day period. During the last two weeks of February 2016, our common stock, as reported on the NYSE, traded below $1.00 per share.\nIn addition to the above stock price criteria, we are considered to be below compliance if our average market capitalization over a consecutive 30 trading-day period is less than $50,000,000 and, at the same time our stockholders\u2019 equity is less than $50,000,000. Since the beginning of 2016, our market capitalization, as reported on the NYSE, has on occasion been below $50,000,000, and our stockholders\u2019 equity at December 31, 2015 is below $50,000,000.\nFor each of the above standards, the NYSE Listed Company Manual sets out rules and processes to cure non-compliance. For instance, upon approval from the NYSE, an issuer has 6 months to cure the listing standard related to stock price. Similarly, an issuer has 18 months to cure the listing standard related to global market capitalization.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to meet the continued listing standards of the NYSE. The delisting of our common shares from the NYSE could result in even further reductions in our share price, would substantially limit the liquidity of our common shares, and could materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital or pursue strategic restructuring, refinancing or other transactions on acceptable terms, or at all. Delisting from the NYSE could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by institutional investors.\nAlthough we have substantial net operating losses and substantial federal income tax net operating loss carry-forwards, our ability to utilize our federal income tax net operating loss carry-forwards to offset any taxable income may be materially limited.\nAs noted in the financial statements included with this Form 10-K, we have substantial net operating losses. As a result, we also have substantial federal income tax net operating loss carry-forwards that we could utilize to offset taxable income in the future. An \u201cownership change\u201d of the Company, as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, would limit, possibly substantially, the amount of our federal income tax net operating loss carry-forwards we can utilize to offset taxable income in any future taxable year. It is possible we will experience or have experienced one or more such ownership changes, whether because our equity interests are publicly-traded or in connection with our efforts to restructure our indebtedness. An ownership change would establish an annual limitation on the amount of federal income tax net operating loss carry-forwards existing prior to the change that we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any future taxable year to an amount generally equal to the value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate. Because the value of our stock can fluctuate materially, it is possible an ownership change would materially limit our ability to utilize our substantial federal income tax net operating loss carry-forwards in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to utilize our federal income tax net operating loss carry-forwards to offset future taxable income.\nLiquidity concerns could result in a downgrade in our debt ratings which could restrict our access to, and negatively impact the terms of, current or future financings or trade credit.\nOur ability to obtain financings and trade credit and the terms of any financings or trade credit is, in part, dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies. We cannot provide\nassurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities, liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix and commodity pricing levels. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access financings or trade credit, increase our borrowing costs and potentially require us to post letters of credit for certain obligations.\nWe cannot control the future price of oil and natural gas and sustained periods of low prices could hurt our profitability and financial condition and could impair our ability to grow our business or to perform the obligations in our agreements, including the agreements governing our indebtedness.\nSustained periods of low commodity prices will adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Our revenues, profitability, liquidity, ability to raise capital for our business, future growth, ability to operate, develop and explore our properties, and the carrying value of our properties depend heavily on prevailing prices for oil and natural gas.\nNatural gas comprised approximately 93% of our total production for the year ended December 31, 2015 and represented 92% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2015. Historically, natural gas prices have been highly volatile, including in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States where the vast majority of our natural gas is produced. Prices have been affected by actions of federal, state and local governments and agencies, foreign governments, national and international economic and political conditions, levels of consumer demand, weather conditions, domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas, proximity and capacity of gas pipelines and other transportation facilities, the price and availability of equipment, materials and personnel to conduct operations, and the price and availability of alternative fuels. These external factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it difficult to estimate future prices of natural gas. Any substantial or extended decline in the price of natural gas will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, including reduced cash flow and borrowing capacity, and lower proved reserves. Price volatility also makes it difficult to budget for and project the return on potential acquisitions and development and exploration projects, and sustained lower gas prices have caused and may, in the future continue to cause, us or the operators of properties in which we have ownership interests to curtail projects and limit or suspend drilling, completion or even production activities.\nCrude oil comprised approximately 7.3% of our total production for the year ended December 31, 2015 and represented 5% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2015. Crude oil prices declined substantially during 2015 and have remained very low during the first months of 2016. In the future, crude oil prices may remain at current levels or fall to lower levels. If crude oil prices remain at current levels or fall to lower levels, this will adversely affect our crude oil operations and our financial condition. Most of the production from our Uinta Basin properties is crude oil. At current oil prices, it is not profitable for us to drill and complete new wells on our Uinta Basin properties.\nIn addition, because we are significantly leveraged, a substantial decrease in our revenue due to low commodity prices is currently impairing and may in the future continue to impair our ability to satisfy payment obligations on our indebtedness and reduce funds available for operations and future business opportunities.\nA substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments.\nThe price we receive for our oil and natural gas heavily influences our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. Oil and natural gas are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile. The spot natural gas prices during 2015 ranged from a high of $3.30 to a low of\n$1.54 per MMBtu and the spot oil prices during 2015 ranged from a high of $61.43 to a low of $34.73 per Bbl. Thus far in 2016, commodity prices have continued to be depressed and volatile, with spot natural gas prices ranging from a high of $2.53 to a low of $1.81 per MMBtu and the spot oil prices ranging from a high of $36.76 to a low of $26.21 per Bbl through February 24, 2016. These markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future.\nThe prices we receive for our production and the levels of our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include the following:\n\u2022\nworldwide and regional economic conditions impacting the global supply and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries;\n\u2022\nthe price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions in or affecting other oil and natural gas-producing countries;\n\u2022\nthe level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production;\n\u2022\nthe level of global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022\nlocalized supply and demand fundamentals and transportation availability;\n\u2022\nweather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022\ndomestic, local and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;\n\u2022\nspeculation as to the future price of oil and natural gas and the speculative trading of oil and natural gas futures contracts;\n\u2022\nprice and availability of competitors\u2019 supplies of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption; and\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels.\nSubstantially all of our production is currently sold at market based prices. Lower oil and natural gas prices will reduce our cash flows, borrowing ability and the present value of our reserves. Lower oil and natural gas prices will reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically. Substantial decreases in oil and natural gas prices could render uneconomic a significant portion of our identified drilling locations, and, like this year, may cause us to make significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or to be unable to claim proved undeveloped reserves at all. If oil and natural gas prices remain at current levels or experience a substantial or extended decline from current levels, our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures will be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may seek protection from our creditors under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or the Canadian Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, or an involuntary petition for bankruptcy may be filed against us in the U.S. or in Canada, any of which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, would have a material adverse impact on the trading price of our securities, and could place our shareholders at significant risk of losing all of their investment in our shares.\nWe have engaged financial and legal advisors to assist us in, among other things, analyzing various strategic alternatives to address our liquidity and capital structure, including strategic and refinancing alternatives to restructure our indebtedness in private transactions. However, if our attempts are unsuccessful or we are unable to complete such a restructuring on satisfactory terms, we may choose to pursue a filing under Chapter 11 or under the equivalent provisions of the Canadian Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.\nSeeking bankruptcy court protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. So long as a Chapter 11 proceeding continues, our senior management would be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort dealing with the reorganization instead of focusing on our business operations. Bankruptcy court protection also may make it more difficult to retain management and other key personnel necessary to the success and growth of our business. In addition, during the period of time we are involved in a bankruptcy proceeding, our customers and suppliers might lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our business successfully and may seek to establish alternative commercial relationships.\nAdditionally, all of our indebtedness is senior to the existing common stock in our capital structure. As a result, we believe that seeking bankruptcy court protection under a Chapter 11 proceeding (or the Canadian equivalent) could cause the shares of our existing common stock to be canceled, result in a limited recovery, if any, for shareholders of our common stock, and would place shareholders of our common stock at significant risk of losing all of their investment in our shares.\nOur substantial indebtedness, liquidity issues and potential to seek restructuring transactions may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOur substantial indebtedness, liquidity issues and efforts to negotiate restructuring transactions may result in uncertainty about our business and cause, among other things:\n\u2022\nthird parties to lose confidence in our ability to explore and produce oil and natural gas, resulting in a significant decline in our revenues, profitability and cash flow;\n\u2022\ndifficulty retaining, attracting or replacing key employees;\n\u2022\nemployees to be distracted from performance of their duties or more easily attracted to other career opportunities; and\n\u2022\nour suppliers, vendors, hedge counterparties and service providers to renegotiate the terms of our agreements, terminate their relationship with us or require financial assurances from us.\nThese events may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nDuring 2015 we recorded a $3.1 billion non-cash write-down of the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties as a result of ceiling test limitations. If oil and natural gas prices stay at current levels or decrease further, we may be required to record additional write-downs of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties in the future.\nWe follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties. A separate cost center is maintained for expenditures applicable to each country in which we conduct exploration and/or production activities. Under the full cost method, the net book value of properties on a country-by-country basis, less related deferred income taxes, may not exceed a calculated \u201cceiling.\u201d The ceiling is the estimated after tax future net revenues from proved oil and gas properties, discounted at 10% per year. Discounted future net revenues are estimated using oil and natural gas spot prices based on the average price during the preceding 12-month period determined as an un-weighted, arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, except for changes which are fixed and determinable by existing contracts. The net book value is compared to the ceiling on a quarterly basis. The excess, if any, of the net book value above the ceiling is required to be written off as an expense. Under SEC full cost accounting rules, any write-off recorded may not be reversed even if higher oil and natural gas prices increase the ceiling applicable to future periods. Future price decreases could result in reductions in the carrying value of such assets and an equivalent charge to earnings.\nFor instance, during 2015, we recorded a $3.1 billion non-cash write-down of the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties as a result of ceiling test limitations, which is reflected with the ceiling test and\nother impairments in our Consolidated Statements of Operations accompanying this report. Further impairments of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties may occur if commodity prices remain at current levels or continue to fall in the future. For example, not taking into account subsequent drilling results, production, changes in oil and natural gas prices, and changes in future development and operating costs, if the commodity price used to calculate our discounted future net revenues had been 10% lower than the price we used to perform our ceiling test calculation at December 31, 2015, the write-down we recorded would have been approximately $400.0 million larger.\nOur reserve estimates may turn out to be incorrect if the assumptions upon which these estimates are based are inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and projected future rates of production and timing of development expenditures, including many factors beyond our control. The reserve data and standardized measures set forth herein represent only estimates. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates of different engineers often vary. In addition, drilling, testing and production data acquired subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising such estimates. Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs that are ultimately recovered. Further, the estimated future net revenues from proved reserves and the present value thereof are based upon certain assumptions, including geologic success, the timing and identification of future drilling locations, commodity prices, future production levels, costs and the ability to finance future development that may not prove correct over time. Predictions of future production levels, development schedules (particularly with regard to non-operated properties), commodity prices and future operating costs are subject to great uncertainty, and the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they are based.\nThe present value of net proved reserves included in this report should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the present value, discounted at 10%, of the pre-tax future net cash flows attributable to our net proved reserves on the average oil and natural gas prices during the 12-month period before the ending date of the period covered by this report determined as an un-weighted, arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, adjusted for quality and transportation fees. The costs to produce the reserves remain constant at the costs prevailing on the date of the estimate. Actual current and future commodity prices and costs may be materially higher or lower, and higher future costs and/or lower future commodity prices may impact whether development of our reserves in the future occurs as scheduled or at all. In addition, the 10% discount factor, which the SEC requires us to use in calculating our discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes, may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital from time to time and/or the risks associated with our business.\nCompetitive industry conditions may negatively affect our ability to conduct operations.\nWe compete with numerous other companies in virtually all facets of our business. Our competitors in development, exploration, acquisitions and production include major integrated oil and natural gas companies as well as numerous independents, including many that have significantly greater resources. Therefore, competitors may be able to pay more for desirable leases and evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties or prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. We also compete for the materials, equipment and services that are necessary for the exploration, development and operation of our properties. Our ability to increase reserves in the future will be dependent on our ability to select and acquire suitable prospects for future exploration and development.\nFactors that affect our ability to compete in the marketplace include:\n\u2022\nour access to the capital necessary to drill and complete wells and acquire properties;\n\u2022\nour ability to acquire and analyze seismic, geological and other information relating to a property;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain the personnel necessary to properly evaluate seismic and other information relating to a property;\n\u2022\nour ability to procure materials, equipment and services required to explore, develop and operate our properties;\n\u2022\nour ability to comply with administrative, regulatory and other governmental requirements; and\n\u2022\nour ability to access pipelines, and the locations of facilities used to produce and transport oil and natural gas production.\nFactors beyond our control affect our ability to effectively market production and may ultimately affect our financial results.\nThe ability to market oil and natural gas depends on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nthe extent of domestic production and imports of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe availability of pipeline, rail and refinery capacity, including facilities owned and operated by third parties;\n\u2022\nthe availability of a market for our oil and natural gas production;\n\u2022\nthe availability of satisfactory transportation arrangements for our oil and natural gas production;\n\u2022\nthe proximity of natural gas production to natural gas pipelines;\n\u2022\nthe effects of inclement weather;\n\u2022\nthe demand for oil and natural gas by utilities and other end users;\n\u2022\nthe availability of alternative fuel sources;\n\u2022\nstate and federal regulations of oil and natural gas marketing and transportation; and\n\u2022\nfederal regulation of natural gas sold or transported in interstate commerce.\nBecause of these factors and other factors beyond our control, we may be unable to market all of the oil and natural gas that we produce or obtain favorable prices for such production.\nAny derivative transactions we enter into may limit our gains and expose us to other risks.\nWe may enter into financial derivative transactions from time to time to manage our exposure to commodity price risks. These transactions limit our potential gains if commodity prices rise above the levels established by our derivative transactions. These transactions may also expose us to other risks of financial losses, for example, if our production is less than we anticipated at the time we entered into a derivative instrument or if a counterparty to our derivative instruments fails to perform its obligations under a derivatives transaction.\nLegislation and regulations related to derivative contracts could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.\nTitle VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) establishes federal oversight and regulation of over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives and requires the U.S.\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d) and the SEC to enact further regulations affecting derivative contracts, including the derivative contracts we use to hedge our exposure to price volatility through the OTC market.\nAlthough the CFTC and the SEC have issued final regulations in certain areas, final rules in other areas and the scope of relevant definitions and/or exemptions still remain to be finalized. In one of its rulemaking proceedings still pending under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC issued on November 5, 2013, a proposed rule imposing position limits for certain futures and option contracts in various commodities (including natural gas) and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Certain specified types of hedging transactions are exempt from these position limits, provided that such hedging transactions satisfy the CFTC\u2019s requirements for \u201cbona fide hedging\u201d transactions or positions. Similarly, the CFTC has issued a proposed rule on margin requirements for swap transactions, which proposes an exemption for commercial end-users, entering into uncleared swaps in order to hedge commercial risks affecting their business, from any requirement to post margin to secure such swap transactions. In addition, the CFTC has issued a final rule authorizing an exception for commercial end-users using swaps to hedge their commercial risks from the otherwise applicable mandatory obligation under the Dodd-Frank Act to clear all swap transactions through a registered derivatives clearing organization and to trade all such swaps on a registered exchange. The Dodd-Frank Act also imposes recordkeeping and reporting obligations on counterparties to swap transactions and other regulatory compliance obligations. All of the above regulations could increase the costs to us of entering into financial derivative transactions to hedge or mitigate our exposure to commodity price volatility and other commercial risks affecting our business.\nWhile it is not possible at this time to predict when the CFTC will issue final rules applicable to position limits or margin requirements, depending on the Company\u2019s ability to satisfy the CFTC\u2019s requirements for the various exemptions available for a commercial end-user using swaps to hedge or mitigate its commercial risks, these rules and regulations may require us to comply with position limits, margin requirements and with certain clearing and trade-execution requirements in connection with our financial derivative activities. The Dodd-Frank Act may require our current counterparties to post additional capital as a result of entering into uncleared financial derivatives with us, which could increase the cost to us of entering into such derivatives. The Dodd-Frank Act may also require our current counterparties to financial derivative transactions to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties, and may cause some entities to cease their current business as hedge providers. These changes could reduce the liquidity of the financial derivatives markets thereby reducing the ability of commercial end-users to have access to financial derivatives to hedge or mitigate their exposure to commodity price volatility. The Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts (including through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available capital for other commercial operations purposes), materially alter the terms of future swaps relative to the terms of our existing bilaterally negotiated financial derivative contracts, and reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against commercial risks we encounter.\nCompliance with environmental and other government regulations could be costly and could negatively impact our production.\nOur operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations, which are continuously being reviewed for amendment and/or expansion, may:\n\u2022\nrequire that we acquire permits before developing our properties;\n\u2022\nrestrict the substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling, completion and production activities;\n\u2022\nlimit or prohibit drilling activities on protected areas such as wetlands or wilderness areas; and\n\u2022\nrequire remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former operations, such as plugging abandoned wells.\nUnder these laws and regulations or under the common law, we could be liable for personal injury and clean-up costs and other environmental, natural resource and property damages, as well as administrative, civil and criminal penalties. We could also be affected by more stringent laws and regulations adopted in the future, including any related to climate change, engine emissions, greenhouse gases and hydraulic fracturing. We maintain limited insurance coverage for sudden and accidental environmental damages, but do not maintain insurance coverage for the full potential liability that could be caused by accidental environmental damages. Accordingly, we may be subject to liability in excess of our insurance coverage or may be required to cease production from properties in the event of environmental damages.\nA significant percentage of our operations are conducted on federal and state lands. These operations are subject to a wide variety of regulations as well as other permits and authorizations which must be obtained from and issued by state and federal agencies. To conduct these operations, we may be required to file applications for permits, seek agency authorizations and comply with various other statutory and regulatory requirements. Complying with any of these requirements may adversely affect our ability to complete our drilling programs at the costs and in the time periods anticipated.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d (\u201cGHGs\u201d) could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and gas we produce.\nMore stringent laws and regulations relating to climate change and GHGs may be adopted and could cause us to incur material expenses to comply with such laws and regulations. In the absence of comprehensive federal legislation on GHG emission control, the EPA attempted to require the permitting of GHG emissions; although the Supreme Court struck down the permitting requirements, it upheld the EPA\u2019s authority to control GHG emissions when a permit is required due to emissions of other pollutants. The EPA also requires the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities and onshore oil and natural gas processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities, which may include facilities we operate. Reporting of GHG emissions from such facilities is required on an annual basis. We will continue to incur costs associated with this reporting obligation.\nIn addition, the United States Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs and many states have already taken legal measures to reduce or measure GHG emission levels, often involving the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs require major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to reduce overall GHG emissions. The cost of these allowances could escalate significantly over time. The adoption and implementation of any legislation or regulatory programs imposing GHG reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce.\nPotential physical effects of climate change could adversely affect our operations and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nIn an interpretative guidance on climate change disclosures, the SEC indicates that climate change could have an effect on the severity of weather (including hurricanes and floods), sea levels, the arability of farmland, and water availability and quality. If such effects were to occur, our exploration and production operations, including the hydraulic fracturing of our wells, have the potential to be adversely affected. Potential adverse effects could include disruption of our production activities, including, for example, damages to our facilities from powerful winds or increases in our costs of operation or reductions in the efficiency of our operations, as well as potentially increased costs for insurance coverages in the aftermath of such effects. Significant physical effects of climate change could also have an indirect effect on our financing and operations by disrupting the transportation or process related services provided by midstream companies, service companies or suppliers with whom we have a business relationship. We may not be able to recover through insurance some or any of the damages, losses or costs that may result from potential physical effects of climate change.\nFederal legislation and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions but is not subject to regulation at the federal level (except for fracturing activity involving the use of diesel). The EPA has commenced a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities and has released a draft report; the final study has not yet been released. A committee of the U.S. House of Representatives is also conducting an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices. In past sessions, legislation was introduced before Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. In addition, some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. Pennsylvania has adopted a variety of regulations limiting how and where fracturing can be performed. Wyoming has adopted regulations requiring producers to provide detailed information about wells they hydraulically fracture in that state. Some states have adopted or are considering adopting regulations requiring disclosure of chemicals in fluids used in hydraulic fracturing or other restrictions on drilling and completion operations, including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells; testing of nearby water wells; restrictions on access to, and usage of, water; and restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations. Any other new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform hydraulic fracturing activities and thereby affect our determination of whether a well is commercially viable. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the federal level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permit requirements or operational restrictions and also to associated permitting delays and potential increases in costs. We have conducted hydraulic fracturing operations on most of our existing wells, and we anticipate conducting hydraulic fracturing operations on substantially all of our future wells. As a result, restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce in commercial quantities and adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nCyber-attacks targeting systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry may adversely impact our operations.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, production and financial activities. We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, and communicate with our employees and third party partners. Unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruptions in our exploration or production operations. Also, computers control nearly all of the oil and gas distribution systems in the United States and abroad, which are necessary to transport our production to market. A cyber-attack directed at oil and gas distribution systems could damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment, delay or prevent delivery of production to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions.\nWhile our operations and financial condition have not been materially and adversely affected by cyber-attacks, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such attacks and resulting losses in the future. Further, as cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber-attacks.\nUnless we are able to replace reserves that we have produced, our cash flows and production will decrease over time.\nOur future success depends on our ability to find, acquire, develop and produce additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Without successful exploration, development or acquisition activities, our reserves and production will decline. We can give no assurance that we will be able to find, develop or acquire additional reserves at acceptable costs.\nWe may not be able to replace our reserves or generate cash flows if we are unable to raise capital. We will be required to make substantial capital expenditures to develop our existing reserves and to discover new oil and gas reserves.\nOur ability to continue exploration and development of our properties and to replace reserves depends upon our ability to comply with our debt covenants, renegotiate our debt agreements, raise significant additional financing, or to seek and obtain other arrangements with industry participants in lieu of raising additional financing. Any arrangements that may be entered into could be expensive to us if such arrangements can be made at all. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital in light of factors such as our financial condition, the market demand for our securities, the general condition of financial markets for independent oil and gas companies (including the markets for debt), oil and natural gas prices and general market conditions. See Item 7 - \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for a discussion of our capital budget. Continued periods of depressed commodity prices or further commodity price decreases could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund capital expenditures. Without the ability to fund capital expenditures, we would be unable to replace reserves and production. There can also be no assurance that we will be able to obtain other satisfactory arrangements to allow further exploration and development of our properties if we are unable to raise additional capital.\nWe expect to use our cash from operations and cash on hand to fund our capital budget during 2016. See Item 7 - \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for information about our liquidity, available cash on hand, and the status of the Credit Agreement. We recently borrowed substantially all of the funds available to us under the Credit Agreement.\nOur operations may be interrupted by severe weather or drilling restrictions.\nOur operations are conducted primarily in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. We also have properties in the north-central Pennsylvania area of the Appalachian Basin. The weather in these areas can be extreme and can cause interruption in our exploration and production operations. Severe weather can result in damage to our facilities entailing longer operational interruptions and significant capital investment. Likewise, our operations are subject to disruption from winter storms and severe cold, which can limit operations involving fluids and impair access to our facilities.\nWe are exposed to operating hazards and uninsured risks that could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow.\nThe oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating risks, including blowouts, fire, explosion, pipe failure, casing collapse, abnormally pressured formations, and environmental hazards such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, discharges of toxic gases, underground migration and surface spills or mishandling of fracture fluids, including chemical additives. The occurrence of any of these events with respect to any property we own or operate (in whole or in part) could have a material adverse impact on us. We and the operators of our properties maintain insurance in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that management believes to be reasonable. However, insurance coverage is not always economically feasible and is not obtained to cover all types of operational risks. The occurrence of a significant event that is not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThere are risks associated with our drilling activity that could impact our results of operations.\nOur oil and natural gas operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards typically associated with drilling, completion, production and transportation of, oil and natural gas. These risks include the necessity of spending large amounts of money for identification and acquisition of properties and for drilling and completion of wells. In the drilling and completing of wells, failures and losses may occur before any deposits of oil or natural gas are found and produced. The presence of unanticipated pressure or irregularities in formations, blow-outs or accidents may cause such activity to be unsuccessful, resulting in a loss of our investment in such activity and possible liabilities. If oil or natural gas is encountered, there can be no assurance that it can be produced in quantities sufficient to justify the cost of continuing such operations or that it can be marketed satisfactorily.\nOur decision to drill a prospect is subject to a number of factors which may alter our drilling schedule or our plans to drill at all.\nA prospect is an area in which our geoscientists have identified what they believe, based on available seismic and geological information, to be indications of hydrocarbons. Our prospects are in various stages of review. Whether or not we ultimately drill our prospects depends on many factors, including but not limited to: the availability and cost of capital; receipt of additional seismic data or reprocessing of existing data; material changes in current of future expected oil or natural gas prices; the costs and availability of drilling and completion equipment; the success or failure of wells drilled in similar formations or which would use the same production facilities and equipment; changes in the estimates of costs to drill or complete wells; decisions of our joint working interest owners; and regulatory, permitting and other governmental requirements. It is possible these factors and others may cause us to alter our drilling schedule or determine that a prospect should not be pursued at all.\nWe have limited control over activities conducted on properties we do not operate.\nWe own interests in properties that are operated by third parties. The success, timing and costs of drilling, completion, and other development activities on our non-operated properties depend on a number of factors that are beyond our control. Because we have only a limited ability to influence and control the operations of our non-operated properties, we can give no assurances that we will realize our targeted returns with respect to those properties.\nOur business depends on gathering and transportation facilities owned by others. Any limitation in the availability of those facilities would interfere with our ability to market the oil and natural gas that we produce.\nThe marketability of our oil and natural gas production will depend in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering and pipeline systems owned by third parties. The amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced and sold is subject to curtailment in certain circumstances, such as pipeline interruptions due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, excessive pressure, physical damage to the gathering or transportation system, or lack of contracted capacity on such systems. The curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months. In many cases, we are provided only with limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration. Any significant curtailment in gathering system or pipeline capacity, or significant delay in the construction of necessary gathering and transportation facilities, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIn addition, if $100.0 million or more of our debt obligations are accelerated, the lessor under our Pinedale Lease Agreement could terminate the Pinedale Lease Agreement. A termination of the Pinedale Lease Agreement would significantly disrupt our ability to produce oil and gas from Pinedale field which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe may fail to fully identify problems with any properties we acquire.\nWe acquired a portion of our acreage position in Wyoming, Pennsylvania, and Utah through property acquisitions and acreage trades, and we may acquire additional acreage in these or other regions in the future. Although we conduct a review of properties we acquire which we believe is consistent with industry practices, we can give no assurance that we have identified or will identify all existing or potential problems associated with such properties or that we will be able to mitigate any problems we do identify.\nOur acquisitions may perform worse than we expected or prove to be worth less than what we paid because of uncertain factors and matters beyond our control. In addition, our acquisitions could expose us to potentially significant liabilities.\nWhen we make acquisitions of oil and gas properties, we make assumptions about many uncertain factors, including estimates of recoverable reserves, expected timing of recovering acquired reserves, future commodity prices, expected development and operating costs, and other matters, many of which are beyond our control. Assumptions about uncertain factors may be wrong, and the properties we acquire may perform worse than we expect, materially and adversely affecting our operations and financial condition.\nIn prior years, including as recently as 2014, transportation and refining capacity for the black wax crude oil produced from our properties in the Uinta Basin was limited. Although production in the Uinta Basin, including from our properties, is down substantially since 2014, if production of black wax crude oil from the Uinta Basin returns to levels achieved by the industry in 2014 and early 2015, our ability to sell our production and the profitability of our operations in the basin may be materially adversely impacted.\nIn December 2013, we acquired oil and gas properties located in the Uinta Basin, Utah. The crude oil these properties produce is known as black wax crude oil because it has high paraffin content. Due to this high paraffin content, transportation options are limited and more expensive than options available to other grades of crude oil. Most of the black wax crude oil produced in the Uinta Basin, including most of our black wax crude oil production, is transported by truck to refiners in the Salt Lake City, Utah area. The remainder of the production is transported by rail to markets outside of the Salt Lake City area. Future changes in regulations affecting transportation of crude oil by rail could increase the costs to the Company, and decrease the availability, of crude oil transportation by rail.\nDuring 2014, market conditions and the unavailability of satisfactory transportation arrangements for this black wax crude oil hindered our access to markets, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing profitable sales outlets for our Utah production in the future. The availability of a ready market depends on a number of factors, including the general demand for and supply of oil and the proximity of alternative reserves to pipelines, rail transportation and terminal facilities. Our ability to market our black wax crude production in the future will depend in substantial part on the availability and capacity of trucking and rail systems servicing the Uinta Basin and refineries capable of handling high paraffin crude, all of which are owned and operated by third parties. We may be required to shut in wells for a lack of a market or because of inadequacy or unavailability of such markets or related transportation. Decreased access to oil markets or access to such markets on unacceptable terms could result in increased costs, decreased margins, decreased production, or other factors which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and operating cash flows.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis report contains or incorporates by reference forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
