RISK FACTORS\nRisks related to Occidental\u2019s business and operations\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our business and the ultimate effect on our operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility in the financial markets. In addition, the pandemic has resulted in travel restrictions, business closures and the institution of quarantining and other restrictions on movement in many communities. As a result, there has been a significant reduction in demand for and prices of crude oil, NGL and natural gas. If the reduced demand for and prices of crude oil, NGL and natural gas persist for a prolonged period, our operations, financial condition, cash flows, level of expenditures and the quantity of estimated proved reserves that may be attributed to our properties may be materially and adversely affected. Our operations also may be adversely affected if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic. We have implemented workplace restrictions in our offices and work sites for health and safety reasons and continue to monitor national, state and local government directives where we have operations and/or offices. Further, our business plan, including our financing and liquidity plan, includes, among other things, planned divestitures. If general economic conditions or conditions in the energy industry persist at current levels for an extended period of time, we may not be able to complete these transactions on favorable terms, in a timely manner or at all. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic may also materially adversely affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not currently known to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks to our operations. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition and operating results, it may also have the effect of heightening the other risks described herein.\nVolatile global and local commodity pricing strongly affect Occidental\u2019s results of operations.\nOccidental\u2019s financial results correlate closely to the prices it obtains for its products, particularly oil and, to a lesser extent, NGL and its chemical products and natural gas.\nPrices for oil, NGL and natural gas fluctuate widely. Historically, the markets for oil, NGL and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. If the prices of oil, NGL or natural gas continue to be volatile or decline, Occidental\u2019s operations, financial condition, cash flows, level of expenditures and the quantity of estimated proved reserves that may be attributed to our properties may be materially and adversely affected. Prices are set by global and local market forces which are not in Occidental\u2019s control. These factors include, among others:\n\u25a0Worldwide and domestic supplies of, and demand for, oil, NGL, natural gas and refined products;\n\u25a0The cost of exploring for, developing, producing, refining and marketing oil, NGL, natural gas and refined products;\n\u25a0Operational impacts such as production disruptions, technological advances and regional market conditions, including available transportation capacity and infrastructure constraints in producing areas;\n\u25a0Changes in weather patterns and climate;\n\u25a0The impacts of the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other non-OPEC member-producing nations that may agree to and maintain production levels;\n\u25a0The worldwide military and political environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or outbreak of armed hostilities or acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u25a0The price and availability of alternative and competing fuels;\n\u25a0Technological advances affecting energy consumption and supply;\n\u25a0Domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;\n\u25a0Shareholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to restrict the exploration, development and production of oil, NGL and natural gas;\n\u25a0Additional or increased nationalization and expropriation activities by foreign governments;\n\u25a0The impact and uncertainty of world health events, including the COVID-19 pandemic;\nOXY 2020 FORM 10-K\nRISK FACTORS\n\u25a0Volatility in commodity markets;\n\u25a0The effect of energy conservation efforts; and\n\u25a0Global inventory levels and general economic conditions.\nThe long-term effects of these and other conditions on the prices of oil, NGL, natural gas and refined products are uncertain and there can be no assurance that the demand or pricing for Occidental\u2019s products will follow historic patterns or recover meaningfully in the near-term. Prolonged or substantial decline, or sustained market uncertainty, in these commodity prices may have the following effects on Occidental\u2019s business:\n\u25a0Adversely affect Occidental\u2019s financial condition, liquidity, ability to reduce debt, pay dividends and finance planned capital expenditures, ability to repurchase shares and results of operations;\n\u25a0Reduce the amount of oil, NGL and natural gas that Occidental can produce economically;\n\u25a0Cause Occidental to delay or postpone some of its capital projects;\n\u25a0Reduce Occidental\u2019s revenues, operating income or cash flows;\n\u25a0Reduce the amounts of Occidental\u2019s estimated proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves;\n\u25a0Reduce the carrying value of Occidental\u2019s oil and natural gas properties due to recognizing impairments of proved properties, unproved properties and exploration assets;\n\u25a0Reduce the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil, NGL and natural gas reserves;\n\u25a0Limit Occidental\u2019s access to, or increase the cost of, sources of capital such as equity and long-term debt; and\n\u25a0Adversely affect the ability of Occidental\u2019s partners to fund their working interest capital requirements.\nGenerally, Occidental\u2019s historical practice has been to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities. In 2019, Occidental entered into 2020 Brent-priced 3-way collars combined with 2021 call options on the same volume to manage its near-term exposure to cash flow variability from oil price risks in 2020. The 2021 call options were sold to enhance the upside retention in 2020. In 2020, management elected to hedge a portion of Occidental\u2019s expected 2021 natural gas production to enhance cash flow stability. In the future, management may continue to hedge some of the risk of oil, NGL and natural gas price fluctuations. Commodity price risk management activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from price increases and may expose us to regulatory, counterparty credit and other risks.\nThe prices obtained for Occidental\u2019s chemical products correlate to the health of the United States and global economies, as well as chemical industry expansion and contraction cycles. Occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals, which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations.\nOccidental may experience delays, cost overruns, losses or other unrealized expectations in development efforts and exploration activities.\nOil, NGL and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil, NGL and natural gas production. In its development and exploration activities, Occidental bears the risks of:\n\u25a0Equipment failures;\n\u25a0Construction delays;\n\u25a0Escalating costs or competition for services, materials, supplies or labor;\n\u25a0Property or border disputes;\n\u25a0Disappointing drilling results or reservoir performance;\n\u25a0Title problems and other associated risks that may affect its ability to profitably grow production, replace reserves and achieve its targeted returns;\n\u25a0Actions by third-party operators of our properties;\n\u25a0Delays and costs of drilling wells on lands subject to complex development terms and circumstances; and\n\u25a0Oil, NGL and natural gas gathering, transportation and processing availability, restrictions or limitations.\nExploration is inherently risky and is subject to delays, misinterpretation of geologic or engineering data, unexpected geologic conditions or finding reserves of disappointing quality or quantity, which may result in significant losses.\nGovernmental actions and political instability may affect Occidental\u2019s results of operations.\nOccidental\u2019s businesses are subject to the actions and decisions of many federal, state, local and foreign governments and political interests. As a result, Occidental faces risks of:\n\u25a0New or amended laws and regulations, or new or different applications or interpretations of existing laws and regulations, including those related to drilling, manufacturing or production processes (including flaring, well stimulation techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and acidization), pipelines, labor and employment, taxes, royalty rates, permitted production rates, entitlements, import, export and use of raw materials, equipment or products, use\nOXY 2020 FORM 10-K\nRISK FACTORS\nor increased use of land, water and other natural resources, safety, the manufacturing of chemicals, asset integrity management, the marketing or export of commodities, security and environmental protection, all of which may restrict or prohibit activities of Occidental or its contractors, increase Occidental\u2019s costs or reduce demand for Occidental\u2019s products. In addition, violation of certain governmental laws and regulations may result in strict, joint and several liability and the imposition of significant civil and criminal fines and penalties;\n\u25a0Refusal of, or delay in, the extension or grant of exploration, development or production contracts; and\n\u25a0Development delays and cost overruns due to approval delays for, or denial of, drilling, construction, environmental and other regulatory approvals, permits and authorizations.\nThe following are examples of actions and decisions recently taken by federal and state governments that impact Occidental\u2019s businesses:\nIn January 2021, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) adopted new regulations that impose siting requirements or \u201csetbacks\u201d on certain oil and gas drilling locations based on the distance of a proposed well pad to occupied structures. Pursuant to the regulations, well pads cannot be located within 500 feet of an occupied structure without the consent of the property owner. As part of the permitting process, the COGCC will consider a series of siting requirements for all drilling locations located between 500 feet and 2,000 feet of an occupied structure. Alternatively, the operator may seek a waiver from each owner and tenant within the designated distance. While Occidental is currently evaluating the impact of these regulations on its business, at this time, Occidental does not anticipate significant near-term changes to our development program in the DJ Basin based on these regulations. However, as a result, certain of Occidental\u2019s proved undeveloped (PUD) reserves have been derecognized as they no longer meet the regulatory certainty criteria to be considered proved reserves. Occidental\u2019s ability to reestablish previously derecognized PUD reserves, as well as establishing new PUD locations, will depend upon Occidental establishing a history of obtaining drilling permits under the new regulations and thus meeting the SEC\u2019s \u201creasonably certain\u201d threshold for adding PUD reserves. Occidental currently believes it will be able to successfully navigate the new setback guidelines.\nAn executive order was issued in January 2021, Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, that mandated an indefinite pause on new oil and gas leasing on federal lands, onshore and offshore, while a comprehensive review of oil and gas permitting and leasing process is conducted by the U.S. Department of the Interior. In conducting this review, the Secretary of the Interior is required to consider whether to adjust royalties associated with oil and gas resources extracted from public lands and offshore waters to account for corresponding climate costs.\nIn addition, effective January 20, 2021, the Department of the Interior issued an order temporarily elevating the decision-making approval previously delegated to the Department of the Interior\u2019s agencies and bureaus, including the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), to issue any onshore and offshore fossil fuel authorization for, including but not limited to a lease, amendment to a lease, affirmative extension of a lease, contract or other agreement or permit to drill to the leadership of the Department of the Interior. Occidental is continuing to evaluate the overall impact of these new regulatory issuances on its oil and gas operations on federal leases.\nIn addition, Occidental has experienced and may continue to experience adverse consequences, such as risk of loss or production limitations, because certain of its international operations are located in countries affected by political instability, nationalizations, corruption, armed conflict, terrorism, insurgency, civil unrest, security problems, labor unrest, OPEC production restrictions, equipment import restrictions and sanctions. Exposure to such risks may increase if a greater percentage of Occidental\u2019s future oil and gas production or revenue comes from international sources.\nOccidental\u2019s oil and gas business operates in highly competitive environments, which affect, among other things, its ability to make acquisitions to grow production and replace reserves.\nResults of operations, reserves replacement and growth in oil and gas production depend, in part, on Occidental\u2019s ability to profitably acquire additional reserves. Occidental has many competitors (including national oil companies), some of which: (i) are larger and better funded; (ii) may be willing to accept greater risks; (iii) have greater access to capital; (iv) have substantially larger staffs; or (v) have special competencies. Competition for reserves may make it more difficult to find attractive investment opportunities or require delay of reserve replacement efforts. Further, during periods of low product prices, any cash conservation efforts may delay production growth and reserve replacement efforts. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry. Our failure to acquire properties, grow production, replace reserves and attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.\nIn addition, Occidental\u2019s acquisition activities carry risks that it may: (i) not fully realize anticipated benefits due to less-than-expected reserves or production or changed circumstances, such as declines in oil, NGL and natural gas prices; (ii) bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties; (iii) experience share price declines based on the market\u2019s evaluation of the activity; or (iv) be subject to liabilities that are greater than anticipated.\nOXY 2020 FORM 10-K\nRISK FACTORS\nOccidental\u2019s oil and gas reserves are estimates based on professional judgments and may be subject to revision.\nReported oil and gas reserves are an estimate based on periodic review of reservoir characteristics and recoverability, including production decline rates, operating performance and economic feasibility at the prevailing commodity prices, assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices, future operating costs and capital expenditures, workover and remedial costs, assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies, the quantity, quality and interpretation of relevant data, taxes and availability of funds. The procedures and methods for estimating the reserves by our internal engineers were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants; however, there are inherent uncertainties in estimating reserves. Actual production, revenues, expenditures, oil, NGL and natural gas prices and taxes with respect to our reserves may vary from estimates and the variance may be material. If Occidental were required to make significant negative reserve revisions, its results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the discounted cash flows included in this Form 10-K should not be construed as the fair value of the reserves attributable to our properties. The estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year in accordance with SEC regulations. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from SEC regulation-compliant prices and costs used for purposes of estimating future discounted net cash flows from proved reserves. Also, actual future net cash flows may differ from these discounted net cash flows due to the amount and timing of actual production, availability of financing for capital expenditures necessary to develop our undeveloped reserves, supply and demand for oil, NGL and natural gas, increases or decreases in consumption of oil, NGL and natural gas and changes in governmental regulations or taxation.\nClimate change and further regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may adversely affect Occidental\u2019s operations or results.\nContinuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional and local legislation and regulatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In December 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA began adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act. The current administration has identified climate change as a priority and has issued new executive orders and regulatory actions prohibiting or restricting oil and gas development activities in certain areas. As an example in January 2021, the actions undertaken by the Department of the Interior to temporarily elevate the decision-making approval process for new fossil fuel leases or permits. In addition, the United States has re-entered the Paris Agreement, which requires countries to periodically review and represent a progression in greenhouse gas emission reduction goals and an executive order was issued, Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis. In the future, the United States may choose to adhere to other international agreements targeting greenhouse gas reductions and there may be new executive orders, regulatory actions and/or legislation targeting greenhouse gas emissions or prohibiting or restricting oil and gas development activities.\nHowever, in the current absence of federal legislation to significantly reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to date, many state governments have established rules aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, some including greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, including refineries and natural gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances.\nThese and other government actions relating to greenhouse gas emissions could require Occidental to incur increased operating and maintenance costs including higher rates charged by service providers, costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emission allowances, pay carbon taxes, or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements or prevent Occidental from conducting oil and gas development activities in certain areas, or they could promote the use of alternative sources of energy and thereby decrease demand for oil, NGL and natural gas and other products that Occidental\u2019s businesses produce. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, oil, NGL, natural gas or other products produced by Occidental\u2019s businesses and lower the value of its reserves. Consequently, government actions designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on Occidental\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and reserves.\nIt is difficult to predict the timing and certainty of such government actions and their ultimate effect on Occidental, which could depend on, among other things, the type and extent of greenhouse gas reductions required, the availability and price of emission allowances or credits, the availability and price of alternative fuel sources, the energy sectors covered and Occidental\u2019s ability to recover the costs incurred through its operating agreements or the pricing of its oil, NGL, natural gas and other products and whether service providers are able to pass increased costs through to Occidental.\nThere also have been efforts in the investment community, including investment advisers and certain sovereign wealth, pension and endowment funds, as well as other stakeholders, promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Such environmental activism and\nOXY 2020 FORM 10-K\nRISK FACTORS\ninitiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution could adversely affect our business activities, operations and ability to access capital. Such initiatives could cause the market value of our securities to decrease, our cost of capital to increase and adversely affect our reputation. Finally, increasing attention to climate change risks has resulted in an increased possibility of governmental investigations and additional private litigation against Occidental without regard to causation or our contribution to the asserted damage, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. Occidental has been named in certain private litigation relating to these matters.\nOccidental has recorded impairments of its proved and unproved oil and gas properties and will continue to assess further impairments in the future.\nWe have recorded impairments of our proved and unproved oil and gas properties resulting from prolonged declines in oil and gas prices and may record such impairments in the future. Past impairments include pre-tax impairment and related charges to both proved and unproved oil and gas properties and a lower of cost or net realizable value adjustment for crude inventory. In 2020, Occidental recognized a pre-tax impairment to its oil and gas proved and unproved properties of $9.2 billion. If there is a worsening of the macroeconomic conditions and if such worsened condition is expected to or does persist for a prolonged period of time, Occidental\u2019s oil and gas properties may be subject to further testing for impairment, which could result in additional non-cash asset impairments. Such impairments could be material to the financial statements.\nOccidental\u2019s businesses may experience catastrophic events.\nThe occurrence of events such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, earthquakes or other acts of nature, well blowouts, pandemics, fires, explosions, pipeline ruptures, chemical releases, oil releases, including maritime releases, releases into navigable waters and groundwater contamination, material or mechanical failure, industrial accidents, physical attacks, abnormally pressured or structured formations and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed may negatively affect Occidental\u2019s businesses and the communities in which it operates. Coastal operations are particularly susceptible to disruption from extreme weather events. Any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us as a result of:\n\u25a0Damage to and destruction of property and equipment, including property and equipment owned by third-parties which our operations rely upon;\n\u25a0Damage to natural resources;\n\u25a0Pollution and other environmental damage, including spillage or mishandling of recovered chemicals or fluids;\n\u25a0Regulatory investigations and penalties;\n\u25a0Loss of well location, acreage, expected production and related reserves;\n\u25a0Suspension or delay of our operations;\n\u25a0Substantial liability claims; and\n\u25a0Repair and remediation costs.\nThird-party insurance may not provide adequate coverage or Occidental may be self-insured with respect to the related losses. In addition, under certain circumstances, we may be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners or operators of properties that we own, lease or operate. As a result, we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities for environmental matters for which we do not have insurance coverage, which could reduce or eliminate funds available for exploration, development or acquisitions or cause us to incur losses.\nOccidental uses CO2 for its EOR operations. Occidental\u2019s production from these operations may decline if Occidental is not able to obtain sufficient amounts of CO2.\nOccidental\u2019s CO2 EOR operations are critical to Occidental\u2019s long-term strategy. Oil production from Occidental\u2019s CO2 EOR projects depends largely on having access to sufficient amounts of naturally occurring or anthropogenic CO2. Occidental\u2019s ability to produce oil from its CO2 EOR projects would be hindered if the supply of CO2 was limited due to, among other things, problems with current CO2 producing wells and facilities, including compression equipment, catastrophic pipeline failure or the ability to economically purchase naturally occurring or anthropogenic CO2. This could have a material adverse effect on Occidental\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Future oil production from its CO2 EOR operations is dependent on the timing, volumes and location of CO2 injections and, in particular, Occidental\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient volumes of CO2. Market conditions may cause the delay or cancellation of the development of naturally occurring CO2 sources or construction of plants that produce anthropogenic CO2 as a byproduct that can be purchased, thus limiting the amount of CO2 available for use in Occidental\u2019s CO2 EOR operations.\nOccidental is exposed to cyber-related risks.\nThe oil and gas industry is increasingly dependent on digital and industrial control technologies to conduct certain exploration, development and production activities. Occidental relies on digital and industrial control systems, related\nOXY 2020 FORM 10-K\nRISK FACTORS\ninfrastructure, technologies and networks to run its business and to control and manage its oil and gas, chemicals, marketing and pipeline operations. Use of the internet, cloud services, mobile communication systems and other public networks exposes Occidental\u2019s business and that of other third parties with whom Occidental does business to cyber attacks. Cyber attacks on businesses have escalated in recent years.\nInformation and industrial control technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by causing delays, impeding processing of transactions and reporting financial results, resulting in the unintentional disclosure of company, partner, customer or employee information or could damage our reputation. A cyber attack involving our information or industrial control systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business associates, could negatively impact our operations in a variety of ways, including but not limited to, the following:\n\u25a0Unauthorized access to seismic data, reserves information, strategic information, or other sensitive or proprietary information could have a negative impact on our ability to compete for oil and natural gas resources;\n\u25a0Data corruption, communication or systems interruption or other operational disruption during drilling activities could result in delays and failure to reach the intended target or cause a drilling incident;\n\u25a0Data corruption, communication or systems interruption or operational disruptions of production-related infrastructure could result in a loss of production or accidental discharge;\n\u25a0A cyber attack on our chemical operations could result in a disruption of the manufacturing and marketing of our products or a potential environmental hazard;\n\u25a0A cyber attack on a vendor or service provider could result in supply chain disruptions, which could delay or halt our construction and development projects;\n\u25a0A cyber attack on third-party gathering, pipeline, processing, terminal or other infrastructure systems could delay or prevent us from transporting, processing and marketing our production;\n\u25a0A cyber attack involving commodities exchanges or financial institutions could slow or halt commodities trading, thus preventing us from marketing our production or engaging in hedging activities;\n\u25a0A cyber attack that halts activities at a power generation facility or refinery using natural gas as feedstock could have a significant impact on the natural gas market;\n\u25a0A cyber attack on a communications network or power grid could cause operational disruption;\n\u25a0A cyber attack on our automated and surveillance systems could cause a loss in production and potential environmental hazards;\n\u25a0A deliberate corruption of our financial or operating data could result in events of non-compliance which could then lead to regulatory fines or penalties; and\n\u25a0A cyber attack resulting in the loss or disclosure of, or damage to, our or any of our customer\u2019s or supplier\u2019s data or confidential information could harm our business by damaging our reputation, subjecting us to potential financial or legal liability and requiring us to incur significant costs, including costs to repair or restore our systems and data or to take other remedial steps.\nEven though Occidental has implemented controls and multiple layers of security to mitigate the risks of a cyber attack that it believes are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such cyber security measures will be sufficient to prevent security breaches of its systems from occurring, and if a breach occurs, it may remain undetected for an extended period of time. Further, Occidental has no control over the comparable systems of the third parties with whom it does business. While Occidental has experienced cyber attacks in the past, Occidental has not suffered any material losses. However, if in the future Occidental\u2019s cyber security measures are compromised or prove insufficient, the potential consequences to Occidental\u2019s businesses and the communities in which it operates could be significant. As cyber attacks continue to evolve in magnitude and sophistication, Occidental may be required to expend additional resources in order to continue to enhance Occidental\u2019s cyber security measures and to investigate and remediate any digital and operational systems, related infrastructure, technologies and network security vulnerabilities, which would increase our costs. A system failure or data security breach, or a series of such failures or breaches, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOccidental\u2019s oil and gas reserve additions may not continue at the same rate and a failure to replace reserves may negatively affect Occidental\u2019s business.\nProducing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Unless Occidental conducts successful exploration or development activities, acquires properties containing proved reserves, or both, proved reserves will generally decline and negatively impact our business. The value of our securities and our ability to raise capital will be adversely impacted if we are not able to replace reserves that are depleted by production or replace our declining production with new production. Occidental expects improved recovery, extensions and discoveries to continue as main sources for reserve additions but factors such as geology, government regulations and permits, the effectiveness of development plans and the ability to make the necessary capital investments or acquire capital are partially or fully outside management\u2019s control and could cause results to differ materially from expectations.\nOXY 2020 FORM 10-K\nRISK FACTORS\nOccidental\u2019s operations and financial results could be significantly negatively impacted by its offshore operations.\nOccidental is vulnerable to risks associated with our offshore operations that could negatively impact our operations and financial results. Occidental conducts offshore operations in the Gulf of Mexico and Ghana. Occidental\u2019s operations and financial results could be significantly impacted by conditions in some of these areas and are also vulnerable to certain unique risks associated with operating offshore, including those relating to the following:\n\u25a0Hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions;\n\u25a0Geological complexities and water depths associated with such operations;\n\u25a0Limited number of partners available to participate in projects;\n\u25a0Oilfield service costs and availability;\n\u25a0Compliance with environmental, safety and other laws and regulations;\n\u25a0Terrorist attacks or piracy;\n\u25a0Remediation and other costs and regulatory changes resulting from oil spills or releases of hazardous materials;\n\u25a0Failure of equipment or facilities; and\n\u25a0Response capabilities for personnel, equipment or environmental incidents.\nIn addition, Occidental conducts some of its exploration in deep waters (greater than 1,000 feet) where operations, support services and decommissioning activities are more difficult and costly than in shallower waters. The deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as international deepwater locations, lack the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters. As a result, deepwater operations may require significant time between a discovery and the time that Occidental can market its production, thereby increasing the risk involved with these operations.\nAdditional domestic and international deepwater drilling laws, regulations and other restrictions, delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration, development, oil spill response and decommissioning plans and other offshore-related developments may have a material adverse effect on Occidental\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nBOEM and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) have imposed more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements for new wells to be drilled in federal waters. In addition, these governmental agencies are continuing to evaluate, develop and implement new, more restrictive regulatory requirements, which could result in additional costs, delays, restrictions or obligations with respect to oil exploration and production operations conducted offshore. For example, the BOEM has considered, and may adopt, supplemental bonding procedures for the decommissioning of offshore wells, platforms, pipelines and other facilities, which may be material. Compliance with these more stringent regulatory requirements and with existing environmental and oil spill regulations, together with any uncertainties or inconsistencies in decisions and rulings by governmental agencies, delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits or exploration, development, oil spill response and decommissioning plans and possible additional regulatory initiatives could result in difficult and more costly actions and adversely affect or delay new drilling and ongoing development efforts.\nOccidental\u2019s indebtedness may make it more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in its business. Further downgrades in Occidental\u2019s credit ratings or future increases in interest rates may negatively impact Occidental\u2019s cost of, and ability to access the capital markets.\nOccidental\u2019s level of indebtedness could increase Occidental\u2019s vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions, economic downturns and adverse developments in its business and/or limit Occidental\u2019s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its business and the industries in which it operates. From time to time, Occidental has relied on access to the capital markets for funding, including in connection with the Acquisition. There can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available to Occidental in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. Occidental\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing or refinancing will be subject to a number of factors, including general economic and market conditions, Occidental\u2019s performance, investor sentiment and its ability to meet existing debt compliance requirements. If Occidental is unable to generate sufficient funds from its operations to satisfy its capital requirements, including its existing debt obligations, or to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, Occidental\u2019s business could be adversely affected. As of December 31, 2020, Occidental\u2019s long-term debt was rated BB by Fitch Ratings, Ba2 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service and BB- by Standard and Poor\u2019s. Any additional downgrade in the credit rating of Occidental could negatively impact its cost of, and ability to access, capital and to effectively execute aspects of its strategy and may require Occidental to provide cash collateral, letters of credit or other forms of security under certain contractual agreements, which would increase Occidental\u2019s operating costs and reduce liquidity. As a result, further downgrades in Occidental\u2019s credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on Occidental\u2019s financial condition, operating results or liquidity.\nOXY 2020 FORM 10-K\nRISK FACTORS\nFurther, a portion of Occidental\u2019s indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates, some of which is tied to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). In July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after the end of 2021. In early December 2020, the administrator for LIBOR proposed, subject to market consultation, to end the publication of one week and two month USD LIBOR after December 2021 and remaining USD LIBOR tenors in mid-2023. At the same time, major U.S. bank regulators called upon banks to cease entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate by the end of 2021 at the latest. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a group of market participants convened under the auspices of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and other U.S. regulators, has recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities, as its recommended alternative benchmark rate to replace USD LIBOR.\nHowever, at this time, it is not known whether or when SOFR or other proposed alternative reference rates will attain market traction as replacements for LIBOR, and the proposal to cease publication of major USD LIBOR tenors by mid-2023 is not yet final. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere. These reforms and other pressures will likely cause LIBOR to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but may include an increase in the cost of Occidental\u2019s variable rate indebtedness, including floating rate notes and interest rate swaps, which may have an adverse effect on Occidental\u2019s financial condition, operating results or cash flows.\nAnadarko\u2019s Tronox settlement may not be deductible for income tax purposes; Occidental may be required to repay the tax refund Anadarko received in 2016 related to the deduction of the Tronox settlement payment, which may have a material adverse effect on Occidental\u2019s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nIn April 2014, Anadarko and Kerr-McGee Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, Kerr-McGee) entered into a settlement agreement for $5.2 billion, resolving all claims that were or could have been asserted in connection with the May 2009 lawsuit filed by Tronox against Anadarko and Kerr-McGee in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. After the settlement became effective in January 2015, Anadarko paid $5.2 billion and deducted this payment on its 2015 federal income tax return. Due to the deduction, Anadarko had a net operating loss carryback for 2015, which resulted in a tentative tax refund of $881 million in 2016.\nThe IRS has audited Anadarko\u2019s tax position regarding the deductibility of the payment and in September 2018 issued a statutory notice of deficiency rejecting Anadarko\u2019s refund claim. Anadarko disagreed and filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court to dispute the disallowance in November 2018. The case was in the IRS appeals process until the second quarter of 2020; however, it has since been returned to the U.S. Tax Court where Occidental expects to continue pursuing resolution. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 740\u2019s guidance on the accounting for uncertain tax positions, as of December 31, 2020, Occidental has recorded no tax benefit on the tentative cash tax refund. If the payment is ultimately determined not to be deductible, Occidental would be required to repay the tentative refund received plus interest totaling approximately $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2020, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and consolidated balance sheets. Occidental\u2019s consolidated financial statements include an uncertain tax position for the tentative cash tax refund ($898 million in federal taxes and $27 million in state taxes) plus accrued interest of approximately $255 million. This amount is not covered by insurance.

The completion of any future divestitures will be subject to customary closing conditions, and certain of the divestitures may be conditioned on the receipt of required government and regulatory approvals. Occidental may not be able to complete its planned divestitures on favorable terms, in a timely manner or at all. Any difficulties with respect to the completion of the planned divestitures could have a material adverse effect on Occidental\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or stock price. See Note 4 - Divestitures and Other Transactions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information about the Total transaction.\nOccidental\u2019s future results could be adversely affected if it is unable to execute new business strategies effectively.\nOccidental\u2019s results of operations depend on the extent to which it can execute new business strategies effectively. Occidental\u2019s strategies, which include reaching net-zero emissions with its operations before 2040, are subject to business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond its control. Additionally, Occidental may be forced to develop or implement new technologies at substantial costs to achieve its strategies. These uncertainties and costs could cause Occidental to not be able to fully implement or realize the anticipated results and benefits of its business strategies.\nOXY 2020 FORM 10-K\nRISK FACTORS", "PERMNO": 34833, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "OXY"}
