{"cik": "825410", "company": "LANDAUER INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-12-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to factors discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, set forth below are certain risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition and cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe rely on a single facility for the primary manufacturing and processing of our dosimetry services and products.\n\ufeff\nThe Company conducts its primary dosimetry manufacturing and laboratory processing operations and performs significant functions for some of its international operations from a single facility in Glenwood, Illinois. If the Company were to lose availability of this facility due to fire, natural disaster or other disruptions, the Company\u2019s operations could be significantly impaired. Despite the Company\u2019s business continuity preparedness efforts, there can be no assurance that such plan could ensure the Company\u2019s ability to rapidly respond to a disaster. Although the Company maintains business interruption insurance, there can be no assurance that the proceeds of such insurance would be sufficient to offset any loss the Company might incur or that the Company would be able to retain its customer base if operations were so disrupted.\n\ufeff\nIncreased IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions and services.\n\ufeff\nIncreased global IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training; comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems; and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information; improper use of our systems and networks; manipulation and destruction of data; defective products; production downtimes; and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness, and operating results.\n\ufeff\nWe rely on a single source for the manufacturing of crystal material, a key component in our OSL technology, and a single vendor for the manufacturing of InLight products.\n\ufeff\nCrystal material is a key component in Landauer\u2019s OSL technology. The Company operates a single crystal manufacturing facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma that currently supplies all OSL crystal radiation measurement material used by the Company. Although multiple sources for raw crystal material exist and inventory levels provide a significant reduction of risk, there can be no assurance that the Company could secure another source to produce finished crystal materials to Landauer\u2019s specification in the event of a disruption at the Stillwater facility. The InLight dosimetry system and its components are manufactured by Panasonic Communications Company (\u201cPanasonic\u201d) under an exclusive agreement. If the Company were to lose availability of its Stillwater facility or materials from Panasonic due to a fire, natural disaster or other disruptions, such loss could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its operations.\n\ufeff\nIf we are not successful in the development or introduction of new technologies and products, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s radiation measurement business is a mature business and the number of workers being monitored for radiation exposure has not grown in recent years. Additionally, economic pressures can adversely affect the value of occupational measurement perceived by customers or increase pricing pressures. The Company believes that the development and introduction of new technologies and products will be essential to help counter these pressures. The development and introduction of new products generally requires substantial and effective research, development and marketing expenditures, some or all of which may be unrecoverable if the new products do not gain market acceptance. New product development itself is inherently risky, as research failures, competitive barriers arising out of the intellectual property rights of others, launch and production difficulties, customer rejection and unexpectedly short product life cycles may occur even after substantial effort and expense on our part. Even in the case of a successful launch of a new product, the ultimate benefit we realize may be uncertain.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn addition, the Company regularly pursues improvements to existing products to maintain its technical position. The adaptability of OSL to new platforms and new formats, the usefulness of older technologies and the introduction of new technologies by the competition all also present various risks to the Company\u2019s business. The failure or lack of market acceptance of a new or updated technology or the inability to respond to market requirements for new technologies could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations or reputation with customers. The cancellation of technology projects or the cessation of use of an existing technology could result in write-downs and charges to the Company\u2019s earnings.\n\ufeff\nWe may fail to adequately protect our customer data.\n\ufeff\nWe may fail to adequately protect our customer data. In the normal course of operations, we collect and maintain confidential data from our customers. Our failure to adequately preserve the security of this data, whether due to technological failures or errors in or deviations from our data maintenance policies and procedures, could result in data loss or corruption. If we fail to adequately maintain and protect our customer data, we could be exposed to government enforcement actions or potential litigation from our customers and could face risk for loss or breach of customer data under state privacy laws or applicable data privacy laws outside the U.S. Additionally, our reputation could be harmed, and we could lose existing and have difficulty attracting new customers, all of which could adversely affect our operating results.\n\ufeff\nIf we are unable to successfully execute business development activities and diversification such as the acquisition and integration of strategic businesses, our on-going business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nA growth strategy of the Company is to explore opportunities to selectively enhance its business through development activities, such as strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. The Company may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates or successfully negotiate, finance or integrate acquisitions. Covenants in the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility may also limit the amount and types of indebtedness that it may incur to finance acquisitions. If the Company is unable to make further acquisitions, it may be unable to realize its growth strategy. Additionally, if the Company is unable to successfully manage acquisition risks, future earnings may be adversely affected. Acquisitions and other business development activities involve various significant challenges and risks, including the following:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nDifficulty in acquiring desired businesses or assets on economically acceptable terms;\n\u00b7\nDifficulty in integrating new employees, business systems and technology;\n\u00b7\nDifficulty in consolidating facilities and infrastructure;\n\u00b7\nPotential need to operate and manage new lines of business;\n\u00b7\nPotential loss of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nDiversion of management\u2019s attention from on-going operations;\n\u00b7\nRealization of satisfactory returns on investments; and\n\u00b7\nDisputes with strategic partners, due to conflicting priorities or conflicts of interest.\n\ufeff\nDevelopment activities could result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, interest and amortization expenses or periodic impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets as well as significant charges related to integration costs. If the Company is unable to successfully integrate and manage businesses that it acquires within expected terms and in a timely manner, its business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nUnforeseen problems with the stabilization and maintenance of our equipment and information systems could interfere with our operations.\n\ufeff\nIn the normal course of its business, the Company must record and process significant amounts of data quickly and accurately and relies on various computer and telecommunications equipment and information technology systems. Any failure of such equipment or systems could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations.\n\ufeff\nCertain of our operations are conducted through joint ventures in which we rely significantly on our joint venture partners.\n\ufeff\nA substantial portion of the Company\u2019s operations are conducted through joint ventures with third parties. In Australia, Brazil, China, and Mexico, the Company has a controlling interest in the related joint ventures. The Company has a 50% equity interest in Nagase-Landauer, Ltd. (\u201cNagase\u201d), a radiation measurement company located in Japan, a 50% equity interest in Epsilon-Landauer Dozimetri, a radiation measurement company located in Turkey, as well as a 49% equity interest in YFH, located in New Mexico. In all of these joint ventures and others, the Company relies significantly on the services and skills of its joint venture partners to manage and conduct the local operations and ensure compliance with local laws and regulations. If the joint venture partners were unable to perform these functions adequately, the Company\u2019s operations in such regions could be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nThere can be no assurances that our operations will generate cash flows in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s ability to make scheduled payments on its existing or future debt obligations and fund operations will depend on its future financial and operating performance. While the Company believes it will continue to have sufficient cash flows to operate its businesses, there can be no assurances that its operations will generate sufficient cash flows to enable it to pay its remaining indebtedness or to fund its other liquidity needs. If the Company cannot make scheduled payments on its debt, the Company will be in default and, as a result, among other things, all outstanding principal and interest under its revolving credit facility will automatically be due and payable which could force the Company to liquidate certain assets or substantially restructure or alter its business operations or debt obligations. Moreover, if the Company is unable to obtain additional capital or if its current sources of financing are reduced or unavailable, the Company may be required to eliminate or reduce the scope of its plans for expansion and growth and this could affect its overall operations.\n\ufeff\nIf we experience decreasing prices for our goods and services and we are unable to reduce our expenses, our results of operations could suffer.\n\ufeff\nThe Company may experience decreasing prices for the goods and services it offers due to customer consolidation, increased influence of hospital group purchasing organizations, and pricing pressure experienced by its customers from managed care organizations, the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other third-party payers, including outside the U.S. Decreasing prices may also be due to increased market power of its customers as the medical industry consolidates and increased competition among dosimetry and physics services providers. If the prices for its goods and services decrease and it is unable to reduce its expenses, the Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nWe may be subject to future impairment losses due to potential declines in the fair value of our assets.\n\ufeff\nAs a result of acquisitions and capital expenditures, the Company has goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets on our balance sheets. The Company tests goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets for impairment on a periodic basis as required and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The events or changes that could require the Company to test its goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets for impairment include a reduction in the Company\u2019s stock price and market capitalization, changes in estimated future cash flows and changes in rates of growth in the Company\u2019s industry or in any of the Company\u2019s reporting units.\n\ufeff\nThe potential for goodwill impairment is increased during a period of economic uncertainty. To the extent the Company acquires a company at a negotiated price based on anticipated future performance, subsequent market\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nconditions may result in the acquired business performing at a lower level than was anticipated at the time of the acquisition. Any of these charges would reduce our operating results and could cause the price of our common stock to decline. A slowing recovery in the U.S., a prolonged recovery or second recession in Europe, and slowing growth in the global economy may result in declining performance that would require the Company to examine its goodwill for potential additional impairment.\n\ufeff\nThe Company will continue to evaluate the carrying value of the remaining goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets, and if it determines in the future that there is a potential further impairment, the Company may be required to record additional losses, which could materially and adversely affect operating results.\n\ufeff\nRestrictions in our revolving credit facility could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe Company has a committed $140.0 million, secured revolving credit facility syndicated with a group of commercial banks that expires on August 2, 2018. The Company reduced the commitment from $175.0 million to $140.0 million in December 2016 based on the Company\u2019s forecast of excess borrowing capacity through August 2, 2018.\n\ufeff\nThe facility also contains certain financial covenants, which were amended in June 2014. The maximum leverage ratio covenant is 3.50 to 1.00 for the remaining loan. The minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant is 1.10 to 1.00 for the remaining loan. The facility\u2019s interest rate is equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) plus a margin of between 1.25% and 2.50% and for the base rate a margin of between 0.25% and 1.50%.\n\ufeff\nIf the Company has significant borrowings under the facility and it violates a covenant or an event of default occurs and the lenders accelerate the maturity of any outstanding borrowings and terminate their commitment to make future loans, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to comply with its financial or other covenants or that any covenant violations will be waived. In addition, if the Company fails to comply with its financial or other covenants, it may need additional financing in order to service or extinguish its indebtedness. In the future, the Company may not be able to obtain financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to it, if at all.\n\ufeff\nOur radiation-measurement and technology-based services business is subject to extensive domestic and foreign government regulations, which could increase our costs, cause us to incur liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\ufeff\nRegulation, present and future, is a constant factor affecting the Company\u2019s business. The radiation measurement industry is subject to federal, state and international governmental regulation. Unknown matters, new laws and regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws or regulations may materially affect the Company\u2019s business or operations in the future and/or could increase the cost of compliance. The equipment commissioning business of LMP, which the Company acquired in November 2009, and the employment of physicists and other healthcare professionals also are subject to federal, state and international governmental regulation and licensing requirements.\n\ufeff\nMany of the Company\u2019s technology-based services must comply with various domestic and international standards that are used by regulatory and accreditation bodies for approving such services and products. The failure of the Company to obtain accreditation for its services and products may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, require the Company to alter its products or procedures or adversely affect the market perception of the effectiveness of its services and products. Changes in these standards and accreditation requirements may also result in the Company having to incur substantial costs to adapt its offerings and procedures to maintain accreditations and approvals. Such adaptations may introduce quality assurance issues during transition that need to be addressed to ensure timely and accurate analyses and data reporting. Additionally, changes affecting radiation protection practices, including new understandings of the hazards of radiation exposure and amended regulations, may impact how the Company\u2019s services are used by its customers and may, in some circumstances, cause the Company to alter its products and delivery of its services.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nProposed new EU medical device regulations, and changed enforcement practices, could adversely affect our marketing of medical devices in the EU.\n\ufeff\nNew EU medical device regulations intended to replace the existing EU legal framework are under consideration and may become applicable to medical devices placed on the EU market. The requirements imposed by the proposed new EU medical device requirements, and related implementing regulations or guidelines, may be more stringent and comprehensive than existing requirements, and, if adopted, could adversely affect our marketing of medical devices in the EU. In addition, notified bodies and government agencies in the EU may change their enforcement practices, both with respect to the existing and proposed new regulations, including by performing unannounced inspections to determine compliance with applicable regulation, and by imposing different or more stringent penalties or sanctions. These and other regulatory and enforcement developments in the EU may also have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.\n\ufeff\nThe current United States and state health reform legislative initiatives, and similar initiatives outside the United States, could adversely affect our operations and business condition.\n\ufeff\nIn both the U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system in ways that might affect the Company\u2019s business. In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. This legislation includes reforms and reductions that could affect Medicare reimbursements and health insurance coverage for certain services and treatments. Effective January 1, 2013, the Health Reform Law also imposed a 2.3% excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices by manufacturers or importers in the U.S., and the new American Health Benefit Insurance Exchanges and their qualified health plans began offering coverage on January 1, 2014. Some states also have pending health reform legislative initiatives. Further, the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, which was created by the Budget Control Act of 2011, concluded its work in November 2011, and issued a statement that it was not able to make a bipartisan agreement, thus triggering the sequestration process. The sequestration process combined with past and potential future government shutdowns have resulted and may result in spending reductions and have and could result in reduced Medicare, Medicaid and other Federal health care reimbursements for the Company\u2019s services and products. Changes in reimbursements and coverages, including risk-sharing arrangements and quality-based reimbursement initiatives, could adversely affect hospitals and other medical services and products providers, which could result in reduced demand for certain services and products offered by the Company, including services offered by its Medical Physics business. Similarly, as the Health Care Reform Law continues to be implemented various states and large insurance companies continue to make decisions about the extent to which they will participate in the programs offered under the law. Reduced participation could also adversely affect hospitals and other medical services and products providers, which could result in reduced demand for certain services and products offered by the Company, including services offered by its Medical Physics business. The Company cannot predict whether or when future healthcare reform initiatives at the Federal or state level or other initiatives affecting its business will be proposed, enacted, implemented or repealed or what impact those initiatives may have on its business, financial condition or results of operations. The Company\u2019s customers and the other entities with which it has a business relationship could react to these initiatives and the uncertainty surrounding these proposals by curtailing or deferring investments, including those for the Company\u2019s services and products.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe applicable healthcare fraud and abuse, privacy, and data security laws and regulations, along with the increased enforcement environment, may lead to an enforcement action targeting the Company, which could adversely affect our business.\n\ufeff\nOur business is subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations including, but not limited to, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, state anti-kickback statutes, the Federal False Claims Act, and state false claims acts, as well as similar regulations outside the U.S. Additionally, to the extent the Company maintains financial relationships with physicians and other healthcare providers, the Company may be subject to Federal and state physician payment sunshine laws and regulations, and similar regulations outside the U.S., which require the Company to track and disclose these financial relationships. These and other laws regulate interactions amongst health care entities and with sources of referrals of business, among other things. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute is a criminal statute that imposes substantial penalties on persons or entities that offer, solicit, pay or receive payments in return for referrals, recommendations, purchases or orders of items or services that are reimbursable by Federal healthcare programs. The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that submits or causes to be submitted a claim to the Federal government that he or she knows (or should know) is false. The Health Reform Law further provides that a claim submitted for items or services, the provision of which resulted from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute, is \u201cfalse\u201d under the False Claims Act and certain other false claims statutes. In addition, many of the Company\u2019s customers must now comply with the TJC\u2019s new Imaging Standards to maintain accreditation, which among other things, is typically needed to bill and receive payment from government and private payors. To the extent that the Company\u2019s Medical Physics or other businesses provide services subject to these Imaging Standards, it may be adversely affected by potential government enforcement actions, or similar adverse actions by its customers, should its services, or those of its customers, fail to meet the Imaging Standards or reimbursement requirements related to such standards.\n\ufeff\nChanges in, or interpretations of, tax rules and regulations may adversely affect our effective tax rates.\n\ufeff\nThe Company is subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and several foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, there could be changes in the valuation of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities; or changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations. The Company is subject to audits in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional tax against us. Although the Company believes our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation, or the effects of a change in tax policy in the U.S. or international jurisdictions where we do business, could have a material effect on our operating results in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\n\ufeff\nAs a portion of our business is conducted outside of the United States, adverse international developments could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe Company conducts business in numerous international markets such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Sweden, Turkey and the United Kingdom. Foreign operations are subject to a number of special risks, including, among others, currency exchange rate fluctuations; disruption in relations; changes in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political, social or economic conditions; political and economic unrest; trade barriers; exchange controls; expropriation; restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to own or operate subsidiaries; the burden of complying with numerous and potentially conflicting laws; and changes in laws and policies, including those governing foreign owned operations.\n\ufeff\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results.\n\ufeff\nThe Company is exposed to market risk, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The financial statements of the Company\u2019s non-U.S. subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S. dollars monthly using the U.S. dollar as the reporting currency. To date, the market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rates has not been material in relation to the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. These risks could increase, however, as the Company expands in international markets.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nSeveral of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources and increased competition could impair sales of our products.\n\ufeff\nThe Company competes on the basis of advanced technologies, competent execution of these technologies, the quality, reliability and price of its services and its prompt and responsive performance. In much of the world, radiation measurement activities are conducted by a combination of private entities and governmental agencies. The Company\u2019s primary radiation measurement and medical physics competitor in the U.S., Global Dosimetry Solutions, a division of Mirion Technologies, is large, has substantial resources, and has been particularly active in recent years in soliciting business from the Company\u2019s customers.\n\ufeff\nOur failure to attract, motivate and retain qualified and key personnel to support our business may have a material adverse effect on our business plans, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s success depends, in large part, upon the talent and efforts of key individuals including highly skilled scientists, physicists and engineers, as well as experienced senior management, sales, marketing and finance personnel. Competition for these individuals is intense and there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in attracting, motivating, or retaining key personnel. The loss of the services of one or more of these senior executives or key employees, or the inability to continue to attract these personnel may have a material effect on its business plans, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s continued ability to compete effectively depends on its ability to attract new skilled employees and to retain and motivate its existing employees.\n\ufeff\nThe Medical Physics business involves the delivery of professional services and is highly labor-intensive. Its success depends largely on its general ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled licensed medical physicists. Further, the Company must successfully maintain the right mix of physicists with relevant experience and skill sets as it expands into new service offerings, and as the market evolves. The loss of a significant number of its physicists, the inability to attract, hire, develop, train and retain additional skilled personnel, or not maintaining the right mix of professionals could have a serious negative effect on the Company, including its ability to manage, staff and successfully complete its existing engagements and obtain new engagements. Qualified physicists are in great demand, and the Company faces significant competition for both senior and junior physicists with the requisite credentials and experience. The Company\u2019s principal competition for talent comes from other outsourced medical physicist firms, hospitals and free-standing radiation therapy centers. Many of these competitors may be able to offer significantly greater compensation and benefits or more attractive lifestyle choices, career paths or geographic locations than those of the Company. Therefore, the Company may not be successful in attracting and retaining the skilled physicists it requires to conduct and expand its operations successfully. Increasing competition for these revenue-generating physicists may also significantly increase the Company\u2019s labor costs, which could negatively affect its margins and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe could be subject to professional liability lawsuits, some of which we may not be fully insured against or reserved for, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nIn recent years, physicians, hospitals and other participants in the healthcare industry have become subject to an increasing number of lawsuits alleging medical malpractice and related legal theories such as negligent hiring, supervision and credentialing, and vicarious liability for acts of their employees or independent contractors. In addition, the level and effect of radiation being administered by certain radiation equipment is also attracting increased scrutiny and giving rise to patient safety claims. Many of these lawsuits involve large claims and substantial defense costs. As the Company increases its presence in the healthcare industry, through the Medical Physics business, it could be exposed to litigation or subject to fines, penalties or suspension of services relating to the compliance with regulatory requirements.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholder Gilead Capital, LP.\n\ufeff\nOn November 22, 2016, Gilead Capital LP (together with its affiliates, \u201cGilead\u201d) filed a Schedule 13D with the SEC, reporting a 5% ownership of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares of Common Stock. On November 28, 2016, Gilead filed a Schedule 13D/A (Amendment No. 1) with the SEC, suggesting that it intended to run a slate of directors in opposition to the Board\u2019s nominees at the 2017 annual meeting of the Company\u2019s stockholders. If Gilead nominates a slate of directors, and does not subsequently withdraw its nominations, a proxy contest is likely to occur and it may require us to incur legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses in addition to those normally expended for a solicitation. The perceived uncertainties as to our future direction also could affect the market price and volatility of our securities.\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 37217, "SIC": 8734, "TIC": "LDR"}
