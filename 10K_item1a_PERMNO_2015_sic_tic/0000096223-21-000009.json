{"cik": "96223", "company": "Jefferies Financial Group Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-01-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business is subject to a number of risks. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report, before you decide whether to purchase our securities. The risks set out below are not the only risks we face. In addition to the specific risks mentioned in this report, we may also be affected by other factors that affect businesses generally such as global or regional changes in economic, business or political conditions, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics, climate change or natural disasters. If any of such risks occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nWe have also set forth certain specific risks associated with certain of our investments. The inclusion or non-inclusion of these risks for specific investments should not be interpreted to mean that a mentioned or non-mentioned investment is more or less important or material than another. Additionally, some of our investments are in securities of issuers that file reports with the SEC. You should also carefully consider the additional risks disclosed by those issuers with the SEC as those risks may also impact your investment in our securities.\nMarket and Liquidity Risks\nOur business is subject to significant credit risk. In the normal course of our businesses, we are involved in the execution, settlement and financing of various customer and principal securities and derivative transactions. These activities are transacted on a cash, margin or delivery-versus-payment basis and are subject to the risk of counterparty or customer nonperformance. Even when transactions are collateralized by the underlying security or other securities, we still face the risks associated with changes in the market value of the collateral through settlement date or during the time when margin is extended and collateral has not been secured or the counterparty defaults before collateral or margin can be adjusted. We may also incur credit risk in our derivative transactions to the extent such transactions result in uncollateralized credit exposure to our counterparties.\nWe seek to control the risk associated with these transactions by establishing and monitoring credit limits and by monitoring collateral and transaction levels daily. We may require counterparties to deposit additional collateral or return collateral pledged. In certain circumstances, we may, under industry regulations, purchase the underlying securities in the market and seek reimbursement for any losses from the counterparty. However, there can be no assurances that our risk controls will be successful.\nA credit rating agency downgrade could significantly impact our businesses. We and Jefferies Group have credit ratings issued by various credit rating agencies. Maintaining our credit ratings is important to our and Jefferies Group's business and financial condition. We advised certain credit rating agencies that we would target specific concentration and liquidity principles, expressed in the form of certain ratios and percentages. A failure to meet these ratios and percentages could trigger a ratings downgrade. We and Jefferies Group intend to access the capital markets and issue debt securities from time to time, and a decrease in our credit ratings or outlook could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position, increase our borrowing costs, decrease demand for our debt securities and increase the expense and difficulty of financing our operations. In addition, in connection with certain over-the-counter derivative contract arrangements and certain other trading arrangements, Jefferies Group or us may be required to provide additional collateral to counterparties, exchanges and clearing organizations in the event of a credit rating downgrade. Such a downgrade could also negatively impact our and Jefferies Group's outstanding debt prices and our stock price. There can be no assurance that our or Jefferies Group's credit ratings will not be downgraded.\nOur principal trading and investments expose us to risk of loss. A considerable portion of our revenues is derived from trading in which we act as principal. We may incur trading losses relating to the purchase, sale or short sale of fixed income, high-yield, international, convertible, and equity securities, loans, derivative contracts and commodities for our own account. In any period, we may experience losses on our inventory positions as a result of the level and volatility of equity, fixed income and commodity prices (including oil prices), lack of trading volume, and illiquidity. From time to time, we may engage in a large block trade in a single security or maintain large position concentrations in a single security, securities of a single issuer, securities of issuers engaged in a specific industry, or securities from issuers located in a particular country or region. In general, because certain of our investments are marked to market on a daily basis, any adverse price movement in these investments could result in a reduction of our revenues and profits. In addition, we may engage in hedging transactions that if not successful, could result in losses.\nWe are exposed to market risk. We are, directly and indirectly, affected by changes in market conditions. Market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions. For example, changes in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest spread, the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for sources of funding, which, in turn, impacts our net interest revenue and earnings. Changes in interest rates could affect the interest earned on assets differently than interest paid on liabilities. In our brokerage operations, a rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread. Conversely, in those operations, a falling interest rate environment generally results in our earning a smaller net interest spread. If we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate risk, changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nMarket risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities, including trading account assets and liabilities, loans, securities, short-term borrowings, corporate debt, and derivatives. Market conditions that change from time to time, thereby exposing us to market risk, include fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, relative exchange rates, and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of an issuer.\nIn addition, disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in our inability to sell, syndicate, or realize the value of security positions, thereby leading to increased concentrations. The inability to reduce our positions in specific securities may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions, but also increase capital requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in or the discontinuance of Interbank Offered Rates (\"IBORs\"), in particular, London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"). Central banks and regulators in a number of major jurisdictions (for example, the U.S., U.K., European Union (\"EU\"), Switzerland and Japan) have convened working groups to find, and implement the transition to, suitable replacements for IBORs. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it will not compel panel banks to contribute to LIBOR after 2021 and possibly prior to then. We currently hold IBOR positions with maturities past 2020. In addition, we rely on vendor applications and data providers that support downstream IBOR data. We are reviewing our positions for a strategic conversion to alternative rates for each currency we deal in. Each jurisdiction has proposed an alternative to LIBOR and other IBORs based on a risk free rate (the Secured Overnight Funding Rate for U.S. Dollars, Sterling Overnight Index Average for Sterling markets, Euro Short Term Rate for Euros and Tokyo Overnight Average Rate for Japanese Yens). It is possible that the discontinuance of the IBORs will result in disruption in the financial markets, suppressed capital markets activities and liquidity, pricing volatility, loss of market share in certain products, adverse tax or accounting impacts, increased compliance, legal and operational costs, increased capital requirements and business continuity issues.\nWe continue to monitor and facilitate the transition from IBOR-referencing products to products referencing alternative reference rates. We have also been monitoring the development of the IBOR Fallbacks Protocol of the International Swaps and\nDerivatives Association, which was published on October 23, 2020, and will enable market participants to incorporate the revisions into their legacy non-cleared derivatives trades with other counterparties as part of IBOR transition.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon those of our individual businesses, and our aggregate investments in particular industries. We are a holding company with investments in businesses and assets in a number of industries. Jefferies Group is our largest investment and we have significant additional investments in the financial services industry. Our business, financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon our various businesses and investments. Any material adverse change in one of our businesses or investments, or in a particular industry in which we operate or invest, may cause material adverse changes to our business, financial condition and results of operations. The more capital we devote to a particular investment or industry may increase the risk that such investment could significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations, possibly in a material adverse way.\nAs a holding company, we depend on dividends, distributions and other payments from our subsidiaries to fund payments on our obligations, including debt obligations. Many of our subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to regulation that restrict dividend payments or reduce the availability of the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to us. In addition, our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and to minimum regulatory capital requirements.\nFrom time to time we may invest in securities that are illiquid or subject to restrictions. From time to time we may invest in securities that are subject to restrictions which prohibit us from selling the subject securities for a period of time. Such agreements may limit our ability to generate liquidity quickly through the disposition of the underlying investment while the agreement is effective.\nEconomic Environment Risks\nThe effects of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") have negatively affected the global economy, the United States economy and the global financial markets, and may disrupt our operations and our clients' operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The ongoing COVID-19 global and national health emergency has caused significant disruption in the international and United States economies and financial markets. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. The spread of COVID-19 has caused illness, quarantines, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in business activity and financial transactions, labor shortages, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability. The United States now has the world's most reported COVID-19 cases, and all 50 states and the District of Columbia have reported cases of infected individuals. Several states, including New York, where we are headquartered, have declared states of emergency. Similar impacts have been experienced in every country in which we do business. Impacts to our business could be widespread and global, and material impacts may be possible, including the following:\n\u2022 Employees contracting COVID-19\n\u2022 Reductions in our operating effectiveness as our employees work from home or disaster-recovery locations\n\u2022 Unavailability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business activities\n\u2022 Unprecedented volatility in global financial markets\n\u2022 Reductions in revenue across our operating businesses\n\u2022 Closure of our offices or the offices of our clients\n\u2022 De-globalization\n\u2022 Potential regulatory scrutiny of our ability to adequately supervise our activities in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements\nWe are taking necessary and recommended precautions to protect the safety and well-being of our employees and customers, including by means of conducting certain business activities and operations remotely. However, no assurance can be given that the steps being taken will be deemed to be adequate or appropriate, nor can we predict the level of disruption which will occur to our employees' ability to provide customer support and service.\nAlthough the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in meaningfully lower stock prices for many companies, as well as the trading prices for our own securities, the markets have not only stabilized but returned to near pre-COVID-19 levels. However, the further spread of the COVID-19 outbreak may materially negatively impact stock and other securities prices and materially disrupt banking and other financial activity generally and in the areas in which we operate. This would likely result in a decline in demand for our products and services, which would negatively impact our liquidity position and our growth strategy. Any one or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our and our consolidated subsidiaries' business, operations, consolidated financial condition, and consolidated results of operations.\nWe may incur losses as a result of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including the emergence of a pandemic, terrorist attacks, extreme weather events or other natural disasters. The occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including the emergence of a pandemic, such as COVID-19, or other widespread health emergency (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency), terrorist attacks, extreme terrestrial or solar weather events or other natural disasters, could create economic and financial disruptions, and could lead to operational difficulties (including travel limitations) that could impair our ability to manage our businesses.\nAbrupt changes in market and general economic conditions have in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our business and profitability and cause volatility in our results of operations. Economic and market conditions have had, and will continue to have, a direct and material impact on our results of operations and financial condition because performance in the financial services industry is heavily influenced by the overall strength of general economic conditions and financial market activity.\nOur investment banking revenue, in the form of advisory services and underwriting, is directly related to general economic conditions and corresponding financial market activity. When the outlook for such economic conditions is uncertain or negative, financial market activity generally tends to decrease, which reduces our investment banking revenues. Reduced expectations of U.S. economic growth or a decline in the global economic outlook could cause financial market activity to decrease and negatively affect our investment banking revenues.\nA sustained and continuing market downturn could lead to or exacerbate declines in the number of securities transactions executed for customers and, therefore, to a decline in the revenues we receive from commissions and spreads. Correspondingly, a reduction of prices of the securities we hold in inventory or as investments would lead to reduced revenues.\nRevenues from our asset management businesses have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by declining securities prices, as well as widely fluctuating securities prices. Because our asset management businesses hold long and short positions in equity and debt securities, changes in the prices of these securities, as well as any decrease in the liquidity of these securities, may materially and adversely affect our revenues from asset management.\nSimilarly, our merchant banking businesses may suffer from the above-mentioned impacts of COVID-19 including employee and customer illnesses and quarantines, cancellations of events and travel, reductions in business activity and financial transactions, labor shortages, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability. As an example, an overall reduction in business activity has led to a decrease in global demand for oil and natural gas thereby causing lower prices for these commodities. Such dramatic price decreases may have a material adverse effect on our investments in Vitesse Energy Finance and JETX Energy.\nIn addition, global economic conditions and global financial markets remain vulnerable to the potential risks posed by certain events, which could include, among other things, political and financial uncertainty in the United States and the European Union, renewed concern about China's economy, complications involving terrorism and armed conflicts around the world, or other challenges to global trade or travel, such as those that have occurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. More generally, because our business is closely correlated to the general economic outlook, a significant deterioration in that outlook or realization of certain events would likely have an immediate and significant negative impact on our business and overall results of operations.\nChanging financial, economic and political conditions could result in decreased revenues, losses or other adverse consequences. These include economic conditions that may be specific to the industries in which our businesses and investments operate, as well as a general economic slowdown, prolonged recession or other market downturn or disruption. Adverse impacts may include the following:\n\u2022A market downturn could lead to a decline in the volume of transactions executed for customers and, therefore, to a decline in revenues we receive from commissions and spreads\n\u2022Adverse changes in the market could lead to decreases in the value of our holdings, both realized and unrealized.\n\u2022Unfavorable conditions or changes in general political, economic or market conditions could reduce the number and size of transactions in which we provide underwriting, financial advisory and other services. Our investment banking revenues, in the form of financial advisory and sales and trading or placement fees, are directly related to the number and size of the transactions in which we participate and could therefore be adversely affected by unfavorable financial, economic or political conditions. In particular, the increasing trend toward sovereign protectionism and deglobalization resulting from the current populist political movement has resulted or could result in decreases in free trade, erosion of traditional international coalitions, the imposition of sanctions and tariffs, governmental closures and no-confidence votes, domestic and international strife, and general market upheaval in response to such results, all of which could negatively impact our business\n\u2022Adverse changes in the securities markets could lead to a reduction in revenues from asset management fees and losses on our capital invested in managed funds. Even in the absence of a market downturn, below-market investment performance by our funds and portfolio managers could reduce asset management revenues and assets under management and result in reputational damage that might make it more difficult to attract new investors\n\u2022Adverse changes in the financial markets could lead to regulatory restrictions that may limit or halt certain of our business activities\n\u2022Limitations on the availability of credit can affect the ability of our businesses and investments to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis, which may adversely affect liquidity and results of operations. Global market and economic conditions have been particularly disrupted and volatile in the last several years and may be in the future. Our cost and availability of funding could be affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads\n\u2022Certain of our current and future businesses and investments may require additional third-party funding to succeed, such as venture capital funding, joint venture funding or other third-party capital. Failure to obtain such third-party funding may cause such business, investment or prospective investment to fail or progress slower than expected which could adversely affect its and our funding, liquidity, operations and profitability. In addition, such failure could also adversely affect our reputation which could adversely affect our business and future business prospects\n\u2022New or increased taxes on compensation payments such as bonuses may adversely affect our profits\n\u2022Should one or more of the competitors of our businesses or investments fail, business prospects and revenue could be negatively impacted due to negative market sentiment causing customers to cease doing business with us and our lenders to cease loaning us money, which could adversely affect our operations, funding and liquidity\n\u2022Unfavorable economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the demand for new loans and the servicing of loans originated by third-parties, which would have an adverse impact on the operations and profitability of some of our financial services businesses and investments\nThe United Kingdom's (\"U.K.\") exit from the EU could adversely affect our businesses and investments. The U.K. left the EU on January 31, 2020, with a transition period until December 31, 2020 during which time the U.K. followed EU rules and a U.K.-EU trade agreement was negotiated governing EU and U.K. relations from January 1, 2021 resulting in a Trade and Cooperation Agreement together with a Political Declaration covering a number of areas including financial services. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement does not include substantive provisions for financial services, in particular it does not allow U.K. investment firms to provide services into the EU under the Passporting regime.\nThe potential impacts related to the delivery of Brexit or the terms of the new economic and security relationship between the U.K. and the EU on the movement of goods, services, people and capital between the U.K. and the EU, customer behavior, economic conditions, interest rates, currency exchange rates, availability of capital or other matters are unclear and could adversely affect our businesses, including our revenues from trading and investment banking activities, particularly in Europe, and our results of operations and financial condition.\nJefferies Group operates substantial parts of its EU businesses from entities based in the U.K. and has taken steps to ensure that it is able to continue to provide services to clients located in the European Economic Area (\"EEA\") jurisdiction without interruption. As such, a Jefferies Group wholly-owned subsidiary, (\"Jefferies GmbH\"), has been established in Germany which is authorized as a MiFID investment firm by BaFin and client relationships have been migrated so that Jefferies GmbH can service EEA institutional clients across Investment Banking, Equities and Fixed Income sectors from its office in Frankfurt and branch offices in Amsterdam, Madrid, Milan, Paris and Stockholm. Due to considerations such as operating expenses, liquidity, leverage and capital, the modified European operating framework will be more complex, less efficient and more costly than would otherwise have been the case.\nOperational Risks\nDamage to our reputation could damage our business. Maintaining our reputation is critical to our attracting and maintaining customers, investors and employees. If we fail to deal with, or appear to fail to deal with, various issues that may give rise to reputational risk, we could significantly harm our business prospects. These issues include, but are not limited to, any of the risks discussed in this Item 1A, appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest, legal and regulatory requirements, ethical issues, money-laundering, cybersecurity and privacy, record keeping, sales and trading practices, failure to sell securities we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels, and the proper identification of the legal, reputational, credit, liquidity and market risks inherent in our products. A failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality, or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly, can result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which can lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs and harm to our reputation. Further, negative publicity regarding us, whether or not true, may also result in harm to our prospects. Our operations in the past have been impacted as some clients either ceased doing business or temporarily slowed down the level of business they do, thereby decreasing our revenue. There is\nno assurance that we will be able to successfully reverse the negative impact of allegations and rumors in the future and our potential failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe may incur losses if our risk management is not effective. We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure. Our risk management processes and procedures are designed to limit our and certain of our subsidiaries' exposure to acceptable levels as we conduct our businesses. We and certain of our subsidiaries apply comprehensive frameworks of limits on a variety of key metrics to constrain the risk profile of our business activities. These limits reflect our risk tolerances for business activity. The frameworks may include inventory position and exposure limits on a gross and net basis, scenario analysis and stress tests, Value-at-Risk, sensitivities, exposure concentrations, aged inventory, amount of Level 3 assets, counterparty exposure, leverage, cash capital, and performance analysis. While we and certain of our subsidiaries employ various risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application, including risk tolerance determinations, cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the specifics and timing of such outcomes. As a result, we may incur losses notwithstanding our risk management processes and procedures.\nThe ability to attract, develop and retain highly skilled and productive employees is critical to the success of our business. Our ability to develop and retain our clients depends on the reputation, judgment, business generation capabilities and skills of our professionals. To compete effectively, we must attract, retain and motivate qualified professionals, including successful financial advisors, investment bankers, trading professionals, portfolio managers and other revenue producing or specialized personnel, in addition to qualified, successful personnel in functional, non-revenue producing roles. Competitive pressures we experience with respect to employees could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nTurnover in the financial services industry is high. The cost of retaining skilled professionals in the financial services industry has escalated considerably. Financial industry employers are increasingly offering guaranteed contracts, upfront payments, and increased compensation. These can be important factors in a current employee's decision to leave us as well as in a prospective employee's decision to join us. As competition for skilled professionals in the industry remains intense, we may have to devote significant resources to attracting and retaining qualified personnel.\nIf we were to lose the services of certain of our professionals, we may not be able to retain valuable relationships and some of our clients could choose to use the services of a competitor instead of our services. If we are unable to retain our professionals or recruit additional professionals, our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected. Further, new business initiatives and efforts to expand existing businesses frequently require that we incur compensation and benefits expense before generating additional revenues.\nMoreover, companies in our industries whose employees accept positions with competitors often claim that those competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices. We may be subject to such claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel who have worked for our competitors. Some of these claims may result in material litigation. We could incur substantial costs in defending against these claims, regardless of their merits. Such claims could also discourage potential employees who work for our competitors from joining us.\nOperational risks may disrupt our business, result in regulatory action against us or limit our growth. Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies, and the transactions we process have become increasingly complex. If any of our financial, accounting or other data processing systems do not operate properly or are disabled or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people or systems, we could suffer an impairment to our liquidity, financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. These systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, including a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more of our buildings. The inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume and complexity of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses.\nCertain of our financial and other data processing systems rely on access to and the functionality of operating systems maintained by third-parties. If the accounting, trading or other data processing systems on which we are dependent are unable to meet increasingly demanding standards for processing and security or, if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, we could be adversely affected. Such consequences may include our inability to effect transactions and manage our exposure to risk.\nIn addition, despite the contingency plans we and certain of our subsidiaries have in place, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which they are\nlocated. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation or other services used by us or third-parties with which we conduct business.\nAny cyber attack, cybersecurity incident, or other information security breach of, or vulnerability in, our technology systems, or those of our clients, partners, counterparties, or other third-party service providers we rely on, could have operational impacts, subject us to significant liability and harm our reputation. Our operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of financial, personal and other information in our computer systems and networks. In recent years, there have been several highly publicized incidents involving financial services companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or other confidential information, as well as cyber attacks involving theft, dissemination and destruction of corporate information or other assets, which in some cases occurred as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third-parties. Cyber attacks can originate from a variety of sources, including third-parties affiliated with foreign governments, organized crime or terrorist organizations. Third-parties may also attempt to place individuals within our firm or induce employees, clients or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information or provide access to our data, and these types of risks may be difficult to detect or prevent.\nLike other financial services firms, we have been the target of attempted cyber attacks and we understand that cybersecurity incidents among financial services firms are on the rise. We are not aware of any material losses relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches. The techniques used in these cyber attacks and cybersecurity incidents are increasingly sophisticated, change frequently and are often not recognized until launched. Although we seek to maintain reasonable security measures, including a suite of authentication and layered information security controls, no security measures are infallible, and we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will always work or that they would detect, mitigate or remediate these risks in a timely manner. Despite our implementation of reasonable security measures and endeavoring to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to human error, natural disasters, power loss, spam attacks, unauthorized access, distributed denial of service attacks, computer viruses and other malicious code, and other events that could result in significant liability and damage to our reputation, and have an ongoing impact on the security and stability of our operations.\nWe also rely on numerous third-party service providers to conduct other aspects of our business operations, and we face similar risks relating to them. While we regularly conduct security assessments on these third-party vendors, we cannot be certain that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyber attack, cybersecurity incident, or other information security breach. In addition, in order to access our products and services, our customers may use computers and other devices that are beyond our security control systems and processes.\nNotwithstanding the precautions we take, if a cyber attack, cybersecurity incident, or other information security breach were to occur, this could jeopardize the information we confidentially maintain, or otherwise cause interruptions in our operations or those of our clients and counterparties, exposing us to liability. As attempted attacks continue to evolve in scope and sophistication, we may be required to expend substantial additional resources to modify or enhance our reasonable security measures, to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to communicate about cyber attacks, cybersecurity incidents, or other information security breaches to our customers, partners, third-party service providers, and counterparties. Though we have insurance against some cyber risks and attacks, we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that exceed our insurance policy limits or are not covered under any of our current insurance policies. A technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements, exposing us to potential disciplinary action by regulators. Successful cyber attacks, cybersecurity incidents, or other information security breaches at other large financial institutions or other market participants, whether or not we are affected, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions that could negatively affect us, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our reasonable security measures or the financial system in general, which could result in a loss of business.\nFurther, in light of the high volume of transactions we process, the large number of our clients, partners and counterparties, and the increasing sophistication of malicious actors, a cyber attack, cybersecurity incident, or other information security breach could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection. We expect that any investigation of a cyber attack, cybersecurity incident, or other information security breach would take substantial amounts of time and resources, and that there may be extensive delays before we obtain full and reliable information. During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm caused by the cyber attack, cybersecurity incident, or other information security breach or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. All of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of such a cyber attack, or cybersecurity incident. In providing services to clients, we manage, utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data, including personal data. As a result, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as U.S. federal, state and international laws governing the protection of personally identifiable information. If any person, including any of our associates, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or employee data, or\notherwise mismanages or misappropriates such data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution. In addition, unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data, whether through system failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients and related revenue. Depending on the circumstances giving rise to the information security breach, this liability may not be subject to a contractual limit or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages.\nEmployee misconduct could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subject us to significant legal liability and reputational harm. There is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, our business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to our clients. If our employees were to improperly use or disclose confidential information provided by our clients, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position, current client relationships and ability to attract future clients. We are also subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our asset management business and our authority over the assets managed by our asset management business. In addition, our financial advisors may act in a fiduciary capacity, providing financial planning, investment advice, and discretionary asset management. The violation of these obligations and standards by any of our employees would adversely affect our clients and us. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective against certain misconduct, including conduct which is difficult to detect. The occurrence of significant employee misconduct could have a material adverse financial effect or cause us significant reputational harm and/or legal and regulatory liability, which in turn could seriously harm our business and our prospects.\nWe may not be able to insure certain risks economically. We cannot be certain that we will be able to insure all risks that we desire to insure economically or that all of our insurers or reinsurers will be financially viable if we make a claim. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits should occur, or if we are required to pay a deductible for an insured loss, results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFuture acquisitions and dispositions of our businesses and investments are possible, changing the components of our assets and liabilities, and if unsuccessful or unfavorable, could reduce the value of our securities. Any future acquisitions or dispositions may result in significant changes in the composition of our assets and liabilities, as well as our business mix and prospects. Consequently, our financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of our securities may be affected by factors different from those affecting our financial condition, results of operations and trading price at the present time.\nOur investment in Berkadia may not prove to be successful and may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. At November 30, 2020, we had an approximately $301.2 million investment in Berkadia. Many factors, most of which are outside of our control, can affect Berkadia's business, including loan losses in excess of reserves, a change in the relationships with U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises or federal agencies, a significant loss of customers, and other factors that directly and indirectly effect the results of operations, including the sales and profitability of Berkadia, and consequently may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nIf Berkadia suffered significant losses and was unable to repay its commercial paper borrowings, we would be exposed to loss pursuant to a reimbursement obligation to Berkshire Hathaway. Berkadia obtains funds generated by commercial paper sales of an affiliate of Berkadia. All of the proceeds from the commercial paper sales are used by Berkadia to fund new mortgage loans, servicer advances, investments and other working capital requirements. Repayment of the commercial paper is supported by a $1.5 billion surety policy issued by a Berkshire Hathaway insurance subsidiary and a Berkshire Hathaway corporate guaranty, and we have agreed to reimburse Berkshire Hathaway for one-half of any losses incurred thereunder. If Berkadia suffers significant losses and is unable to repay its commercial paper borrowings, we would suffer losses to the extent of our reimbursement obligation to Berkshire Hathaway. As of November 30, 2020, the aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding was $1.47 billion.\nLegal, Legislation and Regulation Risks\nNew legislation and regulation may significantly affect our businesses and investments. Significant new legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry is regularly proposed and sometimes adopted. These legislative and regulatory initiatives affect not only us, but also our competitors and certain of our clients. These changes could have an effect on our revenue and profitability, limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, impact the value of assets that we hold, require us to change certain business practices, impose additional costs on us and otherwise adversely affect our business. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that legislation and regulation will not eventually have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In the U.S., such initiatives frequently arise in the aftermath of elections that change the party of the president or the majority party in the House and/or Senate.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\") and the rules and regulations adopted by the CFTC and the SEC have introduced a comprehensive regulatory regime for swaps and SBS and parties that deal in such derivatives (although some rules, including the SEC rules for SBS, have compliance dates that will occur in the future). Two of our subsidiaries are provisionally registered as swap dealers with the CFTC and are members of the NFA. We may also be required in the future to register one or more additional subsidiaries as SBS dealers with the SEC. Certain swaps have been made subject to mandatory clearing and exchange trading and additional swaps and SBS may become subject to such requirements in the future. Pursuant to regulations adopted by the CFTC and bank regulators, swap dealers are required to post and collect variation margin in connection with the trading of uncleared swaps. We have already incurred significant compliance and operational costs as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act swap business conduct and mandatory variation margin rules, and when the compliance dates for all the final rules contemplated by Title VII have been implemented, our swap dealer entities will also be subject to mandatory capital requirements that will likely have an effect on our business. Although there is uncertainty about the full impact of these changes, we expect we will continue to be subject to a complex regulatory framework that will require significant monitoring and compliance expenditures. Negative effects could result from an expansive extraterritorial application of the Dodd-Frank Act and/or insufficient international coordination with respect to adoption of rules for derivatives and other financial reforms in other jurisdictions.\nThe European Market Infrastructure Regulation (\"EMIR\") relating to derivatives entered into force during August 2012 and introduced certain requirements in respect of derivative contracts including: (i) the mandatory clearing of OTC derivative contracts declared subject to the clearing obligation; (ii) risk mitigation techniques in respect of uncleared OTC derivative contracts, including the mandatory margining of uncleared OTC derivative contracts; and (iii) reporting and record keeping requirements in respect of all derivative contracts. EMIR's requirements apply to \"financial counterparties\" such as EU authorized investment firms, credit institutions, insurance companies, undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities and alternative investment funds, and \"non-financial counterparties\" (being an EU entity which is not a financial counterparty). Members of our group who are EU entities or subsidiaries and, when transacting with in-scope EU counterparties, members of our group who are non-EU regulated entities or subsidiaries may be subject to additional obligations and/or costs that may not otherwise have applied. Amendments to EMIR entered into force during 2019 to make the rules more streamlined and proportionate. From January 1, 2021, following the end of the transition period agreed between the EU and the U.K., EMIR will no longer apply under U.K. law; it will be replaced by \"U.K. EMIR\", being EMIR as it forms part of U.K. domestic law by virtue of Section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. U.K. EMIR is therefore expected, at least initially, to impose substantially similar requirements on in-scope U.K. counterparties as those imposed on in-scope EU counterparties under EMIR.\nThe Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation and a revision of the Market in Financial Instruments Directive (collectively referred to as \"MiFID II\") imposes certain restrictions as to the trading of shares and derivatives including market structure-related, reporting, investor protection-related and organizational requirements, requirements on pre- and post-trade transparency, requirements to use certain venues when trading financial instruments (which includes shares and certain derivative instruments), requirements affecting the way investment managers can obtain research, powers of regulators to impose position limits and provisions on regulatory sanctions. The European Commission (\"EC\") has been reviewing MiFID II throughout 2020 and is expected to publish a legislative proposal for changes to MiFID II. The extent of the changes that will be proposed under the MiFID II review is not known; however, subject to certain conditions and exceptions we may be unable to trade shares or derivatives with in-scope counterparties other than as provided by MiFID II and we may also be unable to trade shares or derivatives with, or as, in-scope counterparties under the U.K.'s \"onshored\" version of MiFID II.\nThe EU capital and liquidity legislation for banks and investment firms implemented many of the finalized Basel III capital and liquidity standards, including in relation to the leverage ratio, market risk capital, and a net stable funding ratio. These changes will begin to take effect from June 2021.\nIncreasing regulatory focus on privacy and security issues and expanding laws could impact our businesses and investments and expose us to increased liability. The General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), which went into effect in the EU in May 2018, imposes obligations including, among other things:\n\u2022accountability and transparency requirements, which require companies to demonstrate and record compliance with the GDPR and to provide more detailed information to data subjects regarding the processing of their personal data obligations to consider data protection when any new products or services are developed and to limit the amount of personal data processed\n\u2022compliance with the data protection rights of data subjects including a right of access to or correction of personal data and a right of erasure of personal data\n\u2022the prompt reporting of personal data breaches to the relevant data supervisory authority without undue delay unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the data subject's rights and freedoms\nThe GDPR also includes restrictions on the transfers of personal data from the European Union to jurisdictions that have not been deemed to provide essentially equivalent data protection safeguards through national laws outside of certain legal transfer mechanisms. The GDPR imposes significant fines for serious non-compliance of up to the higher of 4% of an organization's annual worldwide turnover or \u20ac20 million. Data subjects also have a right to compensation as a result of infringement of the GDPR for financial or non-financial losses.\nObligations under the GDPR and implementing member state legislation continue to evolve through legislation and regulatory guidance. In addition to other privacy legislation that is in effect in other regions, numerous proposals regarding privacy and data protection are pending before U.S. and non-U.S. legislative and regulatory bodies. The adopted form of such developing legislation and regulation will determine the level of any resources which we will need to invest to ensure compliance.\nExtensive regulation of our businesses limits our activities, and, if we violate these regulations, we may be subject to significant penalties. We are subject to extensive laws, rules and regulations in the countries in which we operate. Firms that engage in providing financial services must comply with the laws, rules and regulations imposed by national and state governments and regulatory and self-regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over such activities. Such laws, rules and regulations cover many aspects of providing financial services.\nRegulators supervise certain of Jefferies Group's business activities to monitor compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. In addition, if there are instances in which our regulators question our compliance with laws, rules, or regulations, they may investigate the facts and circumstances to determine whether we have complied. At any moment in time, we may be subject to one or more such investigations or similar reviews. At this time, all such investigations and similar reviews are insignificant in scope and immaterial to us. However, there can be no assurance that, in the future, the operations of our businesses will not violate such laws, rules, or regulations, or that such investigations and similar reviews will not result in significant or material adverse regulatory requirements, regulatory enforcement actions, fines or other adverse impact to the operation of our business.\nAdditionally, violations of laws, rules and regulations could subject us to one or more of the following events: civil and criminal liability; sanctions, which could include the revocation of our subsidiaries' registrations as investment advisors or broker-dealers; the revocation of the licenses of our financial advisors; censures; fines; or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nCertain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory financial capital holding requirements, such as the Net Capital Rule, that could impact various capital allocation decisions or limit the operations of our broker-dealers. In particular, compliance with the Net Capital Rule may restrict our broker-dealers' ability to engage in capital-intensive activities such as underwriting and trading, and may also limit their ability to make loans, advances, dividends and other payments.\nAdditional legislation, changes in rules, changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, conflicts and inconsistencies among rules and regulations, or the entering into businesses that subject us to new rules and regulations may directly affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We continue to monitor the impact of new U.S. and international regulation on our businesses.\nLegal liability may harm our business. Many aspects of our businesses involve substantial risks of liability, and in the normal course of business, we have been named as a defendant or codefendant in lawsuits involving primarily claims for damages. The risks associated with potential legal liabilities often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The expansion of our businesses, including increases in the number and size of investment banking transactions and our expansion into new areas impose greater risks of liability. Substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial effect or cause us significant reputational harm, which in turn could seriously harm our business and our prospects.\nA change in tax laws in key jurisdictions could materially increase our tax expense. We are subject to tax in the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions. Changes to income tax laws and regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, or in the interpretation of such laws, or the introduction of new taxes, could significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operating activities and otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIf our tax filing positions were to be challenged by federal, state and local, or foreign tax jurisdictions, we may not be wholly successful in defending our tax filing positions. We record reserves for unrecognized tax benefits based on our assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining tax filing positions. Management exercises significant judgment when assessing the probability of successfully sustaining tax filing positions, and in determining whether a contingent tax liability should be\nrecorded and, if so, estimating the amount. If our tax filing positions are successfully challenged, payments could be required that are in excess of reserved amounts or we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of our net deferred tax asset, either of which result could be significant to our financial condition or results of operations.\nMerchant Banking Risks\nOur estimates of the fair values of holdings of certain merchant banking investments, which we will cease to provide, may differ from what can be realized and how these investments are reflected in our financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). In our January 2021 and June 2020 earnings releases, we disclosed certain estimated fair values of our merchant banking investments, some of which are consolidated. These estimates may differ from how these investments are reflected in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Factors to consider in connection with reviewing these estimates of fair value include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022These estimates are forward-looking statements and should be read in connection with our Cautionary Statement for Forward-Looking Information\n\u2022Although we believe these estimates to be fair and reasonable, these estimates may differ materially from realized values or future estimates\n\u2022Our fair values are, indeed, estimates only and are subject to change\n\u2022Management does not necessarily use these estimates in making business decisions regarding the operation of our business or any decision relating to these investments\n\u2022These estimates may constitute non-GAAP financial measures and should be read in connection with disclosures relating to our use of non-GAAP financial measures\n\u2022We have decided to stop providing these estimates. In our January 4, 2021 earnings release, we stated that, going forward, we would be discontinuing this disclosure as we believe the wind-down of the portfolio diminishes the value of this information, which requires meaningful management time and expenditure to produce\nThe performance of our oil and gas production and development investments, Vitesse Energy Finance and JETX Energy, is impacted by uncertainties specific to the oil and gas industry which we cannot control and may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. At November 30, 2020, we had an approximately $526.6 million investment in Vitesse Energy Finance and JETX Energy. The oil and gas industry, by its nature, involves a high degree of risk. The value of these investments may be impacted by changes in the prices of oil, gas and natural gas liquids, which are affected by local, regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand and which have a history of significant price volatility. These investments are also exposed to changes in regulations affecting the industry, which could increase our cost of compliance, increase taxes or reduce or delay business opportunities. In addition, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in the estimation of future oil and gas production and future income streams associated with production. As a result, actual results could materially differ from those we currently anticipate and our ability to profitably grow these investments could be adversely affected.\nOur investment in real estate may not prove to be successful and may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. At November 30, 2020, we had an approximately $531.6 million investment in real estate businesses, including HomeFed. Many factors, most of which are outside of our control, can affect HomeFed's business, including the state of the housing market in general and other factors that directly or indirectly affect the results of operations, including the sales and profitability of HomeFed, and consequently may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur investment in Linkem may not prove to be successful and may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. At November 30, 2020, we had an approximately $199.0 million investment in Linkem. Many factors, most of which are outside of our control, can affect Linkem's business, including the state of the Italian economy and capital markets in general, competition in the Italian telecommunications markets and other factors that directly and indirectly affect the results of operations, including the sales and profitability of Linkem, and consequently may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur investment in FXCM may not prove to be successful and may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. At November 30, 2020, we had an approximately $133.4 million investment in FXCM. Many factors, most of which are outside of our control, can affect FXCM's business, including the state of international market and economic conditions which impact trading volume and currency volatility, changes in regulatory requirements and other factors that directly or indirectly affect the results of operations, including the sales and profitability of FXCM, and consequently may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur investment in Idaho Timber may not prove to be successful and may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. At November 30, 2020, we had an approximately $85.6 million investment in Idaho Timber. Many factors, most of which are outside of our control, can affect Idaho Timber's business, including demand for its products, prices and availability of raw materials and other factors that directly and indirectly affect the results of operations, including the sales and profitability of Idaho Timber, and consequently may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.", "PERMNO": 20415, "SIC": 6211, "TIC": "JEF"}
