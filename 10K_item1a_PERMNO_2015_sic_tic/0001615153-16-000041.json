RISK FACTORS\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe have limited combined operating history, and there are risks associated with the acquisition of our Subsidiaries that could adversely affect the results of our operations.\nWe were founded in January 2014, and we combined with each of our Founding Companies simultaneously with, and as a condition to, the sale of the shares in our initial public offering in May 2015. Since that time, we have acquired three additional subsidiaries. While we have operated as a combined business with the Subsidiaries since each of their acquisitions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully integrate the operations of our Subsidiaries successfully or to institute the necessary systems and procedures, including accounting and financial reporting systems, to manage the combined enterprise on a profitable basis and to report the results of operations of the combined entities on a timely basis. In addition, there can be no assurance that our management team will be able to successfully manage the combined entity and effectively implement our operating or growth strategies. Our success will depend on management\u2019s ability to integrate our current Subsidiaries and any companies we may acquire in the future into one organization. Our inability to successfully integrate the companies we acquire and to coordinate and integrate certain operational, administrative, financial and information technology systems would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our efforts to locate and attract desirable companies in the business of providing recycled OEM automotive products are not successful or if we are unable to acquire desirable companies on commercially reasonable terms, our growth prospects will be adversely affected.\nOne of our principal growth strategies is to increase our revenue through the acquisition of additional businesses within our industry. We face competition in our pursuit to acquire additional businesses, which limits the number of available companies for sale and may lead to higher acquisition prices. When we identify desirable companies, their owners may not be willing to sell their companies at all or on terms that we have determined to be commercially reasonable. If our efforts to locate and acquire desirable companies are not successful, our growth prospects will be adversely affected.\nOur ability to acquire additional businesses may require financing that we are unable to obtain or to obtain on acceptable terms.\nThe timing, size and success of our acquisition efforts and the associated capital commitments cannot be readily predicted. We have used and intend to continue to use our cash and common stock as consideration for future acquisitions of companies. If our common stock does not maintain a sufficient market value or potential acquisition candidates are unwilling to accept common stock as part of the consideration for the sale of their businesses, we may be required to utilize more of our cash resources, including obtaining additional capital through our existing line of credit or through alternative financing. However, there can be no assurance that our line of credit will have available or adequate capacity to support our acquisition strategy or we will be able to obtain financing if and when it is needed or that it will be available on terms that we deem acceptable. Under our credit facility, permitted acquisitions are subject to bank review and our meeting certain financial ratios, after giving effect to such acquisition. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, cash provided by operating activities and funds available from bank borrowings are not likely to be sufficient for future acquisitions, and that we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing, or other arrangements. There can be no assurance that additional funding, or refinancing of our credit facility, if needed, will be available on terms attractive to us, or at all. Furthermore, any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may be costly and involve further restrictive covenants. Failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our acquisition strategy and on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate future acquisitions or generate sufficient revenues from future acquisitions, which could cause our business to suffer.\nAssuming that we are able to finance the acquisition of a company or a division of a company, there can be no assurance that we will be able to profitably manage such business or successfully integrate such business without substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial problems. There can be no assurance that the businesses we may acquire in the future will achieve anticipated revenues and earnings. Additionally:\n\u2022\nthe key personnel of an acquired business may decide not to work for us;\n\u2022\nchanges in management at an acquired business may impair its relationships with employees and customers;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies among acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nwe may be held liable for environmental risks and liabilities as a result of our acquisitions, some of which we may not have discovered during our due diligence;\n\u2022\nour ongoing business may be disrupted or receive insufficient management attention; and\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated.\nSome or all of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are not able to manage our internal growth, the results of our operations will be adversely affected.\nWe will attempt to grow our revenues through internal growth as well as through acquisitions. There can be no assurance that our systems, procedures and controls will be adequate to support our operations as they expand. Any future growth will also impose significant additional responsibilities on members of experienced management. Furthermore, as we grow, our ability to increase productivity and profitability will be limited by our ability to employ, train and retain skilled personnel to handle critical tasks within our operations and provide services to our customers and partners. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently or that our labor expenses will not increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel. To the extent that we are unable to manage our growth efficiently and effectively, or are unable to attract and retain skilled personnel, our financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nIf the number of vehicles involved in accidents declines or the number of cars being repaired declines, our business could suffer.\nOur business depends on vehicle accidents and mechanical failures for both the demand for repairs using our products and the supply of recycled, remanufactured and refurbished parts. The number and/or severity of accidents and mechanical failures is influenced by factors including, but not limited to, the number of vehicles on the road, the number of miles driven, the ages of drivers, the occurrence and severity of certain weather conditions, the congestion of traffic, the use of cellular telephones and other electronic equipment by drivers, the use of alcohol and drugs by drivers, the effectiveness and extent of adoption of accident avoidance systems in newer vehicles, the reliability of new OEM parts, and the condition of roadways. Increases in fuel prices may cause the number of vehicles on the road, the number of miles driven, and the need for mechanical repairs and maintenance to decline, as motorists seek alternative transportation options. Mild weather conditions, particularly during winter months, tend to result in a decrease in vehicle accidents. Additionally, a number of states and municipalities have adopted, or are considering adopting, legislation banning the use of handheld cellular telephones or other electronic devices while driving, and such restrictions could lead to a decline in accidents.\nSystems designed to help drivers avoid accidents, including but not limited to impact warning or avoidance systems, lane and vehicle recognition systems and driverless vehicle guidance systems are becoming more prevalent and more technologically sophisticated. To the extent manufacturers install or are mandated by law to install accident avoidance systems in their vehicles, the number and severity of accidents could decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend upon the services of our management team.\nOur success depends, in part, upon the continuing contributions of our executive officers and key employees at the management level. This includes, in part, continuing efforts from many of the executives and managers of the current Subsidiaries, whose reputations and client relationships have contributed significantly to the success of those companies. Although we have employment and noncompetition agreements with certain of our key executive officers and managers, there is no guarantee that they will not leave. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or managers, or our failure to attract other executive officers or managers could have a material adverse effect on our business or our business prospects. If we lose the services of any of our key employees at the operating or regional level, we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel, which could harm our business.\nWe face intense competition from local, regional, national and internet-based automotive products providers, and this competition could negatively affect our business.\nThe recycled vehicle replacement parts and automotive recycling industries are highly competitive and are served by local owner-operated companies, several large regional companies and internet-based parts providers. Additionally, in certain regions of the country where we operate, local automotive recycling companies have formed cooperative inventory sharing programs. We currently participate in certain of these programs, but may elect not to in the future, and as a public company, we may not qualify to participate in certain of them. One such cooperative disqualified us from participation because our Subsidiaries were no longer independently owned. We could also face additional competition in the future from others entering the market, such as OEMs,\ninsurance companies, new parts producers other than OEMs, sometimes referred to as \u201caftermarket\u201d suppliers, and industry consolidators. Some of our current and potential competitors may have more operational expertise and greater financial, technical, manufacturing, distribution and other resources, longer operating histories, lower cost structures and better key relationships in the insurance and automotive industries. As a result, they may be able to provide products that we are unable to supply, sell their products at lower costs or serve customers we are unable to serve.\nIf we fail to maintain or adequately replace our relationships with auto body shops, insurers and other customers, through which we make a significant portion of our revenue, our revenue will be adversely affected.\nThe majority of our products and services are sold to collision repair shops, also known as body shops, and mechanical repair shops. Additionally, we indirectly rely on insurance companies to help drive demand, as insurance companies are increasingly influencing repair facilities to use recycled OEM products as a lower cost alternative to new OEM products. We also generate a portion of our revenue from scrap sales to metal recyclers. If we are not able to continue our current or similar arrangements with these body shops, mechanical repair shops, insurers and scrap metal recyclers, the volume of our sales, revenue and profitability will be materially adversely affected.\nAn adverse change in our relationships with auction companies could increase our expenses and hurt our relationships with our customers.\nOur inventory primarily consists of vehicles offered at salvage auctions operated by companies that own auction facilities in numerous locations across the U.S. We do not typically have contracts with these auction companies. A small number of companies control a large percentage of the salvage auction market in the U.S. and Canada. We acquire substantially all of our salvage autos from two of these auction companies. If either of these companies prohibited us from participating in its auctions, began competing with us, or significantly raised its fees, our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers. Moreover, we face competition in the purchase of vehicles from direct competitors, rebuilders, exporters and others.\nWe are subject to environmental regulations and incur costs relating to environmental matters.\nOur operations, both in the U.S. and Canada, are subject to national, state, provincial and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe emission and discharge of wastes, chemicals, contaminants and other hazardous materials into the ground, air, or water;\n\u2022\nthe exposure to hazardous materials; and\n\u2022\nthe generation, handling, storage, use, treatment, identification, reporting, record-keeping, transportation and disposal of industrial by-products, waste water, storm water, solid and hazardous wastes, petroleum products and hazardous materials.\nWe are in the process of implementing environmental management systems that are designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements and to address current outstanding environmental and operating permit issues. However, if we violate or fail to comply with these laws or regulations we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators.\nContamination resulting from vehicle recycling processes can include air, soil, surface water and ground water contamination from the release, storage, transportation, or disposal of motor oil, gasoline, or other petroleum products, antifreeze, transmission fluid, waste solvents, chlorofluorocarbons from air conditioners, other hazardous materials, or metals such as aluminum, cadmium, chromium, lead and mercury. Contamination can migrate on-site or off-site which can increase the risk and the amount of any potential liability.\nIn connection with the acquisition of our current Subsidiaries and other future acquisitions, we may assume the liabilities of the companies we acquire. Contamination at properties owned or operated by the Subsidiaries or companies we acquire in the future may result in liability for us under environmental laws and regulations for the full amount of assessment and remediation-related costs, including those for the investigation and cleanup of contaminated soil, surface water and ground water, building contamination, and impacts to human health, and damages to natural resources. Under certain environmental laws, including but not limited to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, we and our directors and officers could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at, or migrating to or from, the Subsidiaries\u2019 or any newly acquired company\u2019s past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for causing, any such contamination. The costs of complying\nwith environmental laws and regulations and any claims concerning noncompliance or liability with respect to contamination in the future could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results.\nEnvironmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Significant capital and operating costs may be incurred at any time to keep our operations in compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. If it is not economical to make those expenditures, or if we violate any of these laws and regulations, it may be necessary to restrict or modify our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOne of our Subsidiaries is the subject of environmental claims.\nGroundwater and surface water contamination has been detected at the facility in Toronto, Ontario that we acquired as lessee when we acquired the assets of Goldy Metals Incorporated (\"GMI\"), as a result of historical releases and a petroleum hydrocarbon spill in November 2010. Since November 2010, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment issued a series of regulatory orders under Ontario\u2019s Environmental Protection Act that required the owner of GMI to investigate and remediate all areas that were contaminated by the spill and to take protective and remedial actions related to its property and operations as well as adjacent areas. We believe GMI has been and is taking necessary steps to remediate the surface water and groundwater contamination. Furthermore, we did not assume this liability and GMI, its shareholder and certain affiliates have agreed to indemnify us for a period of three years from the date of Combination against any liability that may be imposed on us as a result of this contamination. However, as the successor to GMI\u2019s business and lessee of the facility, we may become legally responsible for this liability, and we and our directors and officers may be responsible under national and provincial laws and regulations for the assessment, delineation, control, clean-up, remediation, monitoring and verification of, or as a result of, any environmental contamination at that site and any affected off-site areas. The owner of GMI and certain of its affiliates have agreed, pursuant to the Combination Agreements, to continue to be responsible for the costs of an additional storm water management, control and discharge system following the completion of the Combinations. However, there can be no assurance that the owner of GMI or its affiliates will perform their obligations under such agreements and their failure to perform would require us to undertake these environmental obligations.\nThe site and operations in Toronto have been operating since the 1960s. During the last decade, the surrounding parkland and agricultural area, as well as the site itself, have been designated part of a new federal urban park. Accordingly, there has been continual governmental, quasi-governmental, and non-governmental body environmental oversight and intervention, including various enforcement initiatives. We anticipate that this will continue.\nThe Province of Ontario has filed a civil lawsuit against GMI and the owner of the land on which the Toronto, Ontario facility is located claiming damages of Canadian Dollars (\"CAD\") $10.5 million plus pre- and post-judgment interest and court costs, for alleged historical and spill-related contamination as well as for alleged property encroachment damage. The lawsuit is currently in the pre-discovery stage. We did not assume this liability, and GMI, its owner and certain affiliates have agreed to indemnify us, subject to certain limits as defined in the Combination agreements, for a period of three years from the date of Combination against any liability that may be imposed on us as a result of this liability. However, we may become legally responsible for this liability as the successor to GMI\u2019s business and lessee of the facility. We cannot assure you that we will not become responsible for this liability, or that GMI and its owner or their affiliates will have the capacity to indemnify us in the event we become responsible for this liability in whole or in part. Our responsibility for this liability in whole or in significant part could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nPrior to the Combinations, GMI was also charged by the Province of Ontario for causing or permitting an oil spill in Toronto which allegedly impaired a nearby creek. This matter was settled through a guilty plea on consent, with GMI paying a penalty of CAD $94,000. A future charge and conviction under the same or other environmental statute in Ontario could result in the imposition of a minimum fine of CAD $100,000 per day plus a 25% surcharge, up to a maximum of CAD $10 million. We did not assume this liability, and GMI, its owner and certain affiliates have agreed to indemnify us for a period of three years from the date of Combination against any liability that may be imposed on us as a result of this liability. However, we may become legally responsible for this liability as the successor to GMI\u2019s business and lessee of the facility. We cannot assure you that we will not become responsible for this liability, or that GMI, and its shareholder or their affiliates will have the capacity to indemnify us in the event we become responsible for this liability in whole or in part. Our responsibility for this liability in whole or in significant part could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nGMI is also the subject of further regulatory orders relating to sedimentation monitoring and control in the creek, rehabilitating the creek area that was diverted in 2011 as well as assessing, preventing, treating and controlling off-site groundwater and surface water discharges. To address these orders, GMI intends to implement a new surface water control, management and discharge system.\nGovernmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our operating licenses and environmental and other permits.\nOur current Subsidiaries and future subsidiaries must receive certain licenses and permits from state and local governments to conduct their operations, including but not limited to permits required by environmental laws. We may face unexpected delays in obtaining the necessary permits and approvals required by environmental and other laws in connection with our facilities. If we violate or fail to obtain or comply with any permits required by environmental or other laws, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. Furthermore, when we develop or acquire a new facility, we must seek the approval of state and local units of government and satisfy applicable siting laws and regulations. Governmental agencies often resist the establishment of an automotive recycling facility in their communities. There can be no assurance that future approvals or transfers will be granted. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and renew the licenses and permits we and our Subsidiaries currently hold.\nWe have a large amount of goodwill as a result of the acquisition of our Subsidiaries, and if such goodwill becomes impaired, our earnings would be adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had recorded goodwill of $76.8 million. Goodwill represents the excess of the amount we pay for our acquisitions over the fair value of the acquired net assets. We have substantial goodwill related to our acquisitions of our Subsidiaries. As we implement our business acquisition strategy, we will be required to account for similar premiums paid on future acquisitions in the same manner. We do not amortize acquired goodwill but instead we test it for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our one reporting unit is less than its carrying value. The goodwill impairment test is based upon a fair value approach comparing fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value, which as of our annual measurement date of October 1, 2015 was an 8.5% margin; we, accordingly, concluded that we did not incur any impairment. Further, there were no events or indicators of goodwill impairment as of year-end that would call into question the analysis as of October 1, 2015.\nTesting for impairment of goodwill involves an estimation of the fair value of our net assets and involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity. There are numerous risks that may cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount, which could lead to the measurement and recognition of goodwill impairment. These risks include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the business climate, a sustained decline in our market capitalization, significant negative variances between actual and expected results, and lowered expectations of future financial results. Significant judgments inherent in these analyses include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, weighted average cost of capital (\u201cWACC\u201d) and the amount of expected future net cash flows. The judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans. Such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. The determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the reporting unit where the goodwill resides. Based on the discounted cash flow valuation at October 1, 2015, a 1% increase in the WACC, terminal growth rate decrease by 0.5%, shortfall against budgeted revenue and gross profit in excess of 2% or changes in other significant variables in the future could potentially result in impairment. If we have any significant impairment to our goodwill, it would have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken. Further, the factors leading to the impairment could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock. For further information regarding the impairment testing done in 2015, see Note 12, Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements in this document.\nOur annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate.\nOur revenue, cost of salvage vehicles and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and on a consolidated basis have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Future factors that may affect our operating results include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the market value of salvage and used vehicles;\n\u2022\nthe availability of salvage vehicles at an attractive price;\n\u2022\nvariations in vehicle accident rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in state or federal laws or regulations affecting our business;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully integrate in a timely manner and manage our acquisitions;\n\u2022\nseverity of weather and seasonality of weather patterns;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure; and\n\u2022\ndeclines in asset values, including but not limited to Goodwill impairment.\n\u2022\ndeclines in scrap metal prices\n\u2022\ndeclines in the value of the Canadian Dollar relative to the US dollar.\nDue to the foregoing factors, our operating results in one or more future periods can be expected to fluctuate and period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as indications of future performance. These fluctuations in our operating results may cause our results to fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nFluctuations in the prices of metals could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur operations generate scrap metal. After we dismantle a salvage vehicle for parts and after vehicles have been used in our self-service business, any remaining metal is sold to processors and brokers of metal and the remaining vehicle hulks are sold to scrap processors. In addition, we receive vehicles from various sources, which we sell at scrap metal market rates calculated on a per-ton basis. The price of scrap metal has historically fluctuated, sometimes significantly, due to market factors. In addition, buyers may stop purchasing metal entirely due to excess supply. To the extent that the price of metal decreases materially, our revenue from such sales will be adversely impacted and a write-down of our inventory value could be required. Despite our recent experience with declining purchase prices on vehicles as a result of reduced commodity prices, there can be no assurance that our vehicle purchasing costs will continue to decrease by a corresponding amount or at the same rate as the scrap metal prices decline, and there may be a delay between the scrap metal price reductions and any vehicle purchasing cost reductions.\nWe operate in Canada, which exposes us to foreign exchange and other risks.\nWe have operations in Canada. Our Canadian operations expose us to additional risks associated with international business, which has had an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We collect revenues and incur costs at our Canadian operations in Canadian dollars. The significant decline in the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar from 2014 to 2015 has had an adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial condition in 2015, and could have a similar effect in the future. In addition to foreign exchange exposure, we are subject to foreign tax, foreign employment laws and regulations and other foreign and domestic laws.\nIf we experience problems with our fleet of trucks, our business could be harmed.\nWe operate a fleet of trucks throughout our network to deliver products to our customers and transfer hubs. We are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services, including inclement weather, disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, availability and price of fuel, and liabilities arising from accidents to the extent we are not covered by insurance. In addition, our failure to deliver parts in a timely and accurate manner could harm our customer relationships and reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on information technology in critical areas of our operations, and a disruption relating to such technology could harm our business.\nWe rely on information technology for significant aspects of our business, including our financial reporting, accounting, accounts payable, payroll, procurement, inventory control, customer selling and billing, sales analysis, vehicle tracking and profitability reporting, as well as an electronic exchange system for identifying and locating parts at other selected recyclers and facilitating brokered sales to fill customer orders for items not in stock. Any disruption relating to our information systems and hardware could seriously harm our operations.\nWe may not be able to sell our products due to existing or new laws prohibiting or restricting the sale of recycled automotive products.\nSome jurisdictions have enacted laws prohibiting or severely restricting the sale of certain recycled automotive products that we provide, such as airbags. Additional jurisdictions could enact similar laws or could prohibit additional automotive products we sell. Restrictions on the products we are able to sell could decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock and Financial Structure\nFuture sales of our common stock or other securities may depress our stock price.\nWe and our stockholders may sell shares of common stock or other equity, debt or instruments which constitute an element of our debt and equity (collectively, \u201csecurities\u201d) in the future. We may also issue shares of common stock under our stock plan or in connection with future acquisitions. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of securities or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock or other securities will have on the price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), the issuance of debt securities, or the perception that such sales or issuances could occur, may cause the price of our common stock to fall.\nOur stock price could be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation.\nThe price of our common stock could be extremely volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022\nvariations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nvariations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;\n\u2022\nannouncements of developments affecting our business or expansion plans by us or others; and\n\u2022\nconditions and trends in the auto parts industry and the economy as a whole.\nIn addition, stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. Downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline. Additionally, the market price for our common stock has been in the past, and in the future may be, adversely affected by allegations made or reports issued by short sellers, analysts or others regarding our business model, our management or our financial accounting.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation often has been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. This type of litigation, if directed at us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to obtain financing in the future and to execute our business strategy.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $20.8 million of debt outstanding under our senior secured credit facility, consisting of $11.2 million under our revolving line of credit and $9.6 million under our term loan. We also have a letter of credit for $5.9 million secured under the facility. In addition, we have contingent consideration arrangements with the former owners of three acquired businesses that could result in substantial future cash obligations in 2016 and 2017 as described in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" and as estimated and recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. The credit facility contains operating restrictions and financial covenants that can restrict our business and limit our access to additional borrowings. Compliance under the financial covenants is measured each quarter and determines how much in additional borrowings, if any, are available to us. At December 31, 2015, we had approximately $4.7 million of additional borrowing capacity under the revolving facility - $2.9 million in U.S. Dollars and $2.4 million that can be drawn in Canadian Dollars. Our significant amount of debt, limited borrowing capacity and our debt service and contingent consideration obligations could limit our ability to satisfy our obligations, limit our ability to operate our business, execute our expansion strategy and impair our competitive position. Moreover, our failure to comply with the covenants and restrictions in our Credit Facility could result in an event of default, which would permit our lender to call for the immediate repayment of the entire amount we owe under our Credit Facility, among other remedies. The acceleration of our obligations under our Credit Facility would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have assumed uncertain tax positions as part of the Combinations.\nWe assumed the uncertain tax positions of certain Founding Companies as part of the Combinations and have recorded reserves for these positions, including related interest and penalties, of approximately $5.7 million as of December 31, 2015. If the settlement of any unrecognized tax reserves is different than that accrued, it would impact our effective tax rate. Under certain conditions, payments made by us, including interest and penalties, for assumed uncertain tax positions are indemnified by the previous owners of the Subsidiaries for a period of three years from the Combinations and we have an indemnification receivable of $5.1 million recorded in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. If a reserved uncertain tax position results in an actual liability and we are unable to collect on or enforce the related indemnification provision or if the actual liability occurs after the three-year indemnity period has expired, there could be a material charge to our consolidated financial results and reduction of cash resources.\nOur officers and directors and the stockholders and former equity interest holders of the Subsidiaries and their affiliates exercise significant control over us.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our executive officers and directors and the stockholders and former equity interest holders of the Subsidiaries and their immediate family members beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 26% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders are able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, which could delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us. These stockholders may have interests that are different from yours.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, Delaware law and our loan documents could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they, among other things:\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue up to 100,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;\n\u2022\ndo not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nestablish supermajority voting requirements in order to amend certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation; and\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to the Delaware anti-takeover provisions contained in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on this provision to prevent or delay an acquisition of us. In addition, our credit agreement provides that a change of control is an event of default, which could impede an acquisition, takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. We intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. We cannot assure you that you will receive a return on your investment when you sell your shares or that you will not lose the entire amount of your investment.\nOur internal controls have been determined to not be effective, and we may not succeed in establishing and maintaining effective internal controls, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our Company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting for all of our Subsidiaries and Fenix. In an effort to remediate deficiencies in our internal controls, we are in the process of adding personnel to our accounting staff, standardizing financial reporting policies and procedures and upgrading our internal accounting systems. In addition, we have implemented steps to establish a company-wide system of uniform account classifications, and are migrating all operations to common information systems. However, this is a significant task and an integral part of our integration\nplan for acquired businesses. The integration is still in progress and may require substantial resources at significant cost over an extended period of time to complete. If we fail to establish and thereafter maintain effective controls over financial reporting, our ability to accurately report on our financial results on a timely basis will be adversely affected.\nWhen we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined under the JOBS Act, our auditors will be required to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls. Additionally, our principal executive and financial officers of the Company will be required to certify in the Company's annual and quarterly filings (i) that such reports are accurate and complete and that we have established and maintained adequate internal control over financial reporting, or, (ii) if we have not established and maintained adequate internal controls, that such officers have disclosed to our auditors and our audit committee all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information. If we are unable to certify that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nThe requirements of being a public company strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAs a public company with listed equity securities, we must comply with certain laws, regulations and requirements, including corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, related regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) and the requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market, with which we were not required to comply as a private company. Complying with these statutes, regulations and requirements occupies a significant amount of the time of our board of directors and management and results in significant costs and expenses, which will increase after we are no longer an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. Among the actions we have taken or are in the process of taking are to:\n\u2022\ninstitute comprehensive corporate governance and compliance functions;\n\u2022\ndesign, establish, evaluate and maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;\n\u2022\ncomply with rules promulgated by the NASDAQ Global Market;\n\u2022\nprepare and distribute periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws;\n\u2022\nestablish internal policies, such as those relating to disclosure controls and procedures and insider trading;\n\u2022\ninvolve and retain outside counsel and accountants in connection with these activities; and\n\u2022\nestablish an investor relations function.\nDue to the historic decentralized cash basis financial reporting at the Subsidiaries, complex accounting required by the acquisitions of Subsidiaries and our lack of effective controls over financial reporting, we have incurred accounting and auditing fees that are very high for a public company of our size. In addition, these complexities have resulted in our inability to file two quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and a Form 10-K in a timely manner. Continued high accounting and auditing costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, and continued late filing of routine securities filings could undermine investors\u2019 confidence in our Company.\nWe are an emerging growth company and our reliance on the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions and relief from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies, but are not applicable to emerging growth companies. In particular, while we are an emerging growth company, we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are subject to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and we are not required to hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation or shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We have taken advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations and may elect to take advantage of other reduced burdens in future filings. Investors may find our common stock less attractive when we rely on these exemptions and relief. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may decline and/or become more volatile.", "PERMNO": 15372, "SIC": 5010, "TIC": "FENX"}
