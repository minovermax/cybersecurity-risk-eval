RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock contains a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following risk factors before deciding whether to invest in our securities. Our business, including our operating results and financial condition, could be harmed by any of these risks. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in our filings with the SEC, including our financial statements and related notes. Actual dollar amounts are used in this Item 1 A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe highly cyclical nature of supply and demand in the industry may lead to volatile changes in charter rates and vessel values, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings, liquidity and available cash.\nThe marine transportation industry is both cyclical and volatile in terms of charter rates and profitability. Fluctuations in charter rates and vessel values result from changes in supply and demand both for tanker capacity and for oil and oil products. Factors affecting these changes in supply and demand are generally outside of the Company\u2019s control. The nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable and could adversely affect the values of the Company\u2019s vessels or result in significant fluctuations in the amount of charter revenues the Company earns, which could result in significant volatility in OSG\u2019s quarterly results and cash flows. Factors influencing the demand for tanker capacity include:\n\u25cf supply and demand for, and availability of, energy resources such as oil, oil products and natural gas, which affect customers\u2019 need for vessel capacity;\n\u25cf global and regional economic and political conditions, including armed conflicts, terrorist activities and strikes, that among other things could impact the supply of oil, as well as trading patterns and the demand for various vessel types;\n\u25cf regional availability of refining capacity and inventories;\n\u25cf changes in the production levels of crude oil (including in particular production by OPEC, the United States and other key producers);\n\u25cf changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns, including changes in the distances that cargoes are transported, changes in the price of crude oil and changes to the West Texas Intermediate and Brent Crude Oil pricing benchmarks;\n\u25cf environmental and other legal and regulatory developments and concerns;\n\u25cf construction or expansion of new or existing pipelines or railways;\n\u25cf weather and natural disasters;\n\u25cf competition from alternative sources of energy; and\n\u25cf international sanctions, embargoes, import and export restrictions or nationalizations and wars.\nMany of the factors that influence the demand for tanker capacity will also, in the longer term, effectively influence the supply of tanker capacity, since decisions to build new capacity, invest in capital repairs, or to retain in service older capacity are influenced by the general state of the marine transportation industry from time to time. Factors influencing the supply of vessel capacity include:\n\u25cf the number of newbuilding deliveries;\n\u25cf the conversion of vessels from transporting oil and oil products to carrying dry bulk cargo or vice versa;\n\u25cf the number of vessels that are removed from service, whether via scrapping or conversion to storage or other means;\n\u25cf availability and pricing of other energy sources such as natural gas for which tankers can be used or to which construction capacity may be dedicated;\n\u25cf port or canal congestion; and\n\u25cf environmental and maritime regulations.\n17 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nThe market value of vessels fluctuates significantly, which could adversely affect OSG\u2019s liquidity or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition.\nJones Act and U.S. Flag vessel market values have, on average, generally declined over the past several years; however, the market value of Jones Act vessels has fluctuated over time and is based upon various factors, including:\n\u25cf age of the vessel;\n\u25cf general economic and market conditions affecting the tanker industry, including the availability of vessel financing;\n\u25cf number of vessels in the Jones Act fleet;\n\u25cf types and sizes of vessels available;\n\u25cf changes in trading patterns affecting demand for particular sizes and types of vessels;\n\u25cf cost of newbuilds;\n\u25cf prevailing level of charter rates;\n\u25cf competition from other shipping companies and from other modes of transportation; and\n\u25cf technological advances in vessel design and propulsion.\nThe fluctuating market values of the vessels can impact the Company\u2019s liquidity regardless of whether the Company sells the vessels or continues to hold the vessels. For example, if OSG sells a vessel at a sale price that is less than the vessel\u2019s carrying amount on the Company\u2019s financial statements, OSG will incur a loss on the sale and a reduction in earnings and surplus. On the other hand, declining values of the Company\u2019s vessels could adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity by limiting its ability to raise cash by refinancing vessels.\nEven if the Company does not need immediate liquidity from the sale or refinancing of vessels, the Company may experience significant impairment charges upon a decline in vessel value. The Company evaluates events and changes in circumstances that have occurred to determine whether they indicate that the carrying amount of the vessels might not be recoverable. This review for potential impairment indicators and projection of future cash flows related to the vessels is complex and requires the Company to make various estimates, including future freight rates, the markets in which the vessels are expected to operate, earnings from the vessels, market appraisals and discount rates, all of which have historically been volatile. The Company evaluates the recoverable amount of a vessel as the sum of its undiscounted estimated future cash flows. If the recoverable amount is less than the vessel\u2019s carrying amount, the vessel\u2019s carrying amount is then compared to its estimated fair value, which is determined using vessel appraisals or discounted estimated future cash flows. If the vessel\u2019s carrying amount is less than its fair value, it is deemed impaired. The carrying values of the Company\u2019s vessels may differ significantly from their fair market value. Any charges relating to such impairments could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nAn increase in the supply of Jones Act vessels without a commensurate increase in demand for such vessels could cause charter rates to decline, which could adversely affect OSG\u2019s revenues, profitability and cash flows, as well as the value of its vessels.\nThe marine transportation industry has historically been highly cyclical, as the profitability and asset values of companies in the industry have fluctuated based on changes in the supply of and demand for vessels. If the number of new ships of a particular class delivered exceeds the number of vessels of that class being scrapped, available capacity in that class will increase. Given the smaller number of tankers operating in the U.S. domestic market, the impact of even a limited increase in capacity supply may negatively affect the market and may have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s revenues, profitability and cash flows.\n18 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nOSG conducts certain of its operations internationally, which subjects the Company to changing economic, political and governmental conditions abroad that may adversely affect its business.\nThe Company conducts certain of its operations internationally, and its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the countries and regions where its vessels are employed.\nOSG must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, anti-money laundering laws; and anti-competition regulations. Moreover, the shipping industry is generally considered to present elevated risks in these areas. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on the Company\u2019s business operations and on the Company\u2019s ability to transport cargo to one or more countries, and could also materially affect the Company\u2019s brand, ability to attract and retain employees, international operations, business and operating results. Although OSG has policies and procedures designed to achieve compliance with these laws and regulations, OSG cannot be certain that its employees, contractors, joint venture partners or agents will not violate these policies and procedures. OSG\u2019s operations may also subject its employees and agents to extortion attempts.\nChanges in fuel prices may adversely affect profits.\nFuel is a significant, if not the largest, expense in the Company\u2019s shipping operations when vessels are under voyage charter. Accordingly, an increase in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability if these increases cannot be passed onto customers. The price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside the Company\u2019s control, including geopolitical developments; supply and demand for oil and gas; actions by OPEC, and other oil and gas producers; war and unrest in oil producing countries and regions; regional production patterns; and environmental concerns. Fuel may become much more expensive in the future, which could reduce the profitability and competitiveness of the Company\u2019s business compared to other forms of transportation.\nShipping is a business with inherent risks, and OSG\u2019s insurance may not be adequate to cover its losses.\nOSG\u2019s vessels and their cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost because of events including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf marine disasters;\n\u25cf bad weather;\n\u25cf mechanical failures;\n\u25cf human error;\n\u25cf war, terrorism and piracy;\n\u25cf grounding, fire, explosions and collisions;\n\u25cf business interruptions due to labor strikes, port closings and boycotts and\n\u25cf other unforeseen circumstances or events.\nThese hazards may result in death or injury to persons; loss of revenues or property; environmental damage; higher insurance rates; damage to OSG\u2019s existing customer relationships and industry reputation; and market disruptions, and delay or rerouting, all of which may also subject OSG to litigation. In addition, the operation of tankers has unique operational risks associated with the transportation of oil. An oil spill may cause significant environmental damage and the associated costs could exceed the insurance coverage available to the Company. Compared to other types of vessels, tankers are also exposed to a higher risk of damage and loss by fire, whether ignited by a terrorist attack, collision, or other cause, due to the high flammability and high volume of the oil transported in tankers. Any of these events could result in loss of revenues, decreased cash flows and increased costs.\n19 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nWhile the Company carries insurance to protect against certain of these risks, risks may arise against which the Company is not adequately insured. For example, a catastrophic spill could exceed OSG\u2019s $1 billion per vessel insurance coverage and have a material adverse effect on its operations. In addition, OSG may not be able to procure adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future, and any particular claim may not be paid by its insurers. In the past, new and stricter environmental regulations have led to higher costs for insurance covering environmental damage or pollution, and new regulations could lead to similar increases or even make this type of insurance unavailable.\nFurthermore, even if insurance coverage is adequate to cover the Company\u2019s liabilities arising from the loss of a vessel, OSG may not be able to timely obtain a replacement ship.\nOSG may also be subject to calls, or premiums, in amounts based not only on its own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which OSG obtains insurance coverage for tort liability. OSG\u2019s payment of these calls could result in significant expenses which would reduce its profits and cash flows or cause losses.\nConstraints on capital availability have adversely affected the tanker industry and OSG\u2019s business.\nConstraints on capital may adversely affect the financial condition of certain of the Company\u2019s customers, financial lenders and suppliers. Entities that suffer a material adverse impact on their financial condition may be unable or unwilling to comply with their contractual commitments to OSG including the refusal or inability of customers to pay charter hire to OSG or the inability or unwillingness of financial lenders to honor their commitments to lend funds. While OSG seeks to monitor the financial condition of its customers, financial lenders and suppliers, the availability and accuracy of information about the financial condition of such entities and the actions that OSG may take to reduce possible losses resulting from the failure of such entities to comply with their contractual obligations may be limited. Any such failure could have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s revenues, profitability and cash flows. In addition, adverse financial conditions may inhibit these entities from entering into new commitments with OSG, which could also have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s revenues, profitability and cash flows.\nThe Company also faces other potential constraints on capital relating to counterparty credit risk and constraints on OSG\u2019s ability to borrow funds. The Company is subject to credit risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts and any failure by these counterparties to meet their obligations could cause the Company to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing revenues and earnings. OSG has incurred significant indebtedness which could affect its ability to finance its operations, pursue desirable business opportunities and successfully run its business in the future, all of which could affect OSG\u2019s ability to fulfill its obligations under that indebtedness.\nPublic health threats, including the possible coronavirus pandemic, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations and financial results.\nPublic health threats and other highly communicable diseases, outbreaks of which have already occurred in various parts of the world near where OSG operates, could adversely impact the Company\u2019s operations, the operations of the Company\u2019s customers and the global economy, including the worldwide demand for crude oil and the level of demand for OSG\u2019s services. Any quarantine of personnel, restrictions on travel to or from countries in which OSG operates, or inability to access certain areas could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations. Travel restrictions, operational problems or large-scale social unrest in any part of the world in which OSG operates, or any reduction in the demand for tanker services caused by public health threats in the future, may impact OSG\u2019s operations and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nActs of piracy on ocean-going vessels could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nAlthough the Company\u2019s fleet operates mainly in U.S. waters, there are occasions when a vessel may be in an area where pirate attacks are a concern. The frequency of pirate attacks on seagoing vessels remains high, particularly in the western part of the Indian Ocean, off the west coast of Africa and in the South China Sea. If piracy attacks result in regions in which the Company\u2019s vessels are deployed being characterized by insurers as \u201cwar risk\u201d zones, as the Gulf of Aden has been, or Joint War Committee \u201cwar and strikes\u201d listed areas, premiums payable for insurance coverage could increase significantly, and such insurance coverage may become difficult to obtain. Crew costs could also increase in such circumstances due to risks of piracy attacks.\n20 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nIn addition, while OSG believes the charterer remains liable for charter payments when a vessel is seized by pirates, the charterer may dispute this and withhold charter hire until the vessel is released. A charterer may also claim that a vessel seized by pirates was not \u201con-hire\u201d for a certain number of days and it is therefore entitled to cancel the charter party, a claim the Company would dispute. The Company may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, hijacking as a result of an act of piracy against the Company\u2019s vessels, or an increase in the cost (or unavailability) of insurance for those vessels, could have a material adverse impact on OSG\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such attacks may also impact the Company\u2019s customers, which could impair their ability to make payments to the Company under its charters.\nTerrorist attacks and international hostilities and instability can affect the tanker industry, which could adversely affect OSG\u2019s business.\nTerrorist attacks, the outbreak of war, or the existence of international hostilities could damage the world economy, adversely affect the availability of and demand for crude oil and petroleum products and adversely affect both the Company\u2019s ability to charter its vessels and the charter rates payable under any such charters. In addition, OSG operates in a sector of the economy that is likely to be adversely impacted by the effects of political instability, terrorist or other attacks, war or international hostilities. In the past, political instability has also resulted in attacks on vessels, mining of waterways and other efforts to disrupt international shipping, particularly in the Arabian Gulf region. These factors could also increase the costs to the Company of conducting its business, particularly crew, insurance and security costs, and prevent or restrict the Company from obtaining insurance coverage, all of which could have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nOSG has incurred significant indebtedness which could affect its ability to finance its operations, pursue desirable business opportunities and successfully run its business in the future, all of which could affect OSG\u2019s ability to fulfill its obligations under that indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2019, OSG had $368.0 million of outstanding indebtedness. OSG\u2019s substantial indebtedness and interest expense could have important consequences, including:\n\u25cf limiting OSG\u2019s ability to use a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations in other areas of its business, including for working capital, capital expenditures and other general business activities, because OSG must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service its debt;\n\u25cf to the extent OSG\u2019s future cash flows are insufficient, requiring the Company to seek to incur additional indebtedness in order to make planned capital expenditures and other expenses or investments;\n\u25cf limiting OSG\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and other expenses or investments planned by the Company;\n\u25cf limiting the Company\u2019s flexibility and ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures and adverse changes in government regulation, and OSG\u2019s business and industry;\n\u25cf limiting OSG\u2019s ability to satisfy its obligations under its indebtedness;\n\u25cf increasing OSG\u2019s vulnerability to a downturn in its business and to adverse economic and industry conditions generally;\n\u25cf placing OSG at a competitive disadvantage as compared to its less-leveraged competitors;\n\u25cf limiting the Company\u2019s ability, or increasing the costs, to refinance indebtedness; and\n\u25cf limiting the Company\u2019s ability to enter into hedging transactions by reducing the number of counterparties with whom OSG can enter into such transactions as well as the volume of those transactions.\nOSG\u2019s ability to continue to fund its obligations and to reduce debt may be affected by general economic, financial market, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, among other things. An inability to fund the Company\u2019s debt requirements or reduce debt could have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n21 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nAdditionally, the actual or perceived credit quality of the Company\u2019s charterers (as well as any defaults by them) could materially affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain the additional capital resources that it will require to purchase additional vessels or significantly increase the costs of obtaining such capital. The Company\u2019s inability to obtain additional financing at a higher-than-anticipated cost, or at all, could materially affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and its ability to implement its business strategy.\nThe Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness and could in the future breach covenants in its credit facilities and term loans.\nThe Company\u2019s earnings, cash flow and the market value of its vessels vary significantly over time due to the cyclical nature of the tanker industry, as well as general economic and market conditions affecting the industry. As a result, the amount of debt that OSG can manage in some periods may not be appropriate in other periods and its ability to meet the financial covenants to which it is subject or may be subject in the future may vary. Additionally, future cash flow may be insufficient to meet the Company\u2019s debt obligations and commitments. Any insufficiency could negatively impact OSG\u2019s business.\nThe term loan, due 2023, term loans, due 2024, and term loan, due 2026, contain certain restrictions relating to new borrowings and, the movement of funds between OBS and OSG, as set forth in the loan agreement. While the Company was in compliance with these requirements as of December 31, 2019, a decrease in vessel values could require the Company to make mandatory payments on its existing term loans or cause the Company to breach certain covenants in future financing agreements that the Company may enter into from time to time. If the Company is unable to make the mandatory prepayments or breaches such covenants and is unable to remedy the relevant breach or obtain a waiver, the Company\u2019s lenders could accelerate its debt and foreclose on the Company\u2019s owned vessels.\nA range of economic, competitive, financial, business, industry and other factors will affect future financial performance, and, accordingly, the Company\u2019s ability to generate cash flow from operations and to pay debt. Many of these factors, such as charter rates, economic and financial conditions in the tanker industry and the economy, the creditworthiness of our customers, or competitive initiatives of competitors, are beyond the Company\u2019s control. If OSG does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy its debt obligations, it may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as:\n\u25cf refinancing or restructuring its debt;\n\u25cf selling tankers or other assets;\n\u25cf reducing or delaying investments and capital expenditures; or\n\u25cf seeking to raise additional capital.\nUndertaking alternative financing plans, if necessary, might not allow OSG to meet its debt obligations. The Company\u2019s ability to restructure or refinance its debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets, its access to such markets and its financial condition at that time. The OBS Term Loan had a maturity date of August 5, 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company refinanced $325.0 million and paid off the remaining balance of the OBS Term Loan. Any future refinancing of debt could be at higher interest rates and might require the Company to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict OSG\u2019s business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict OSG from adopting certain alternatives. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit OSG to meet its scheduled debt service obligations. The Company\u2019s inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations, to meet the covenants of its credit agreements and term loans and/or to obtain alternative financing in such circumstances, could materially and adversely affect OSG\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n22 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nChanges in demand in specialized markets in which the Company currently operates or changes in governmental support may lead the Company to redeploy certain vessels to other markets or put its ability to participate in specialized markets at risk.\nThe Company deploys its vessels in several niche markets, including lightering in the Delaware Bay. The Company conducts those lightering operations with one ATB which was purpose built for these operations. If there is lower demand for this vessel in the Delaware Bay lightering market, the Company may have to redeploy this ATB in other markets. If that were to occur, the Company may not be able to compete profitably in the new markets, and the ATB may not be able to be redeployed to new markets without substantial modification. In addition, the Company would be required to pay daily liquidated damages to MarAd if this vessel was deployed in the contiguous coastwise trades.\nThe Company has two vessels participating in the MSP which derive a substantial percentage of revenues earned from transporting cargoes reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under MarAd\u2019s Cargo Preference program. The Cargo Preference program works to promote and facilitate a U.S. maritime transportation system and oversees the administration of and compliance with U.S. cargo preference laws and regulations. Those laws require shippers to give U.S.-flag vessels a preference to transport any government-impelled ocean borne cargoes. Government-impelled cargo is cargo that is moving either as a direct result of Federal government involvement, indirectly through financial sponsorship of a Federal program, or in connection with a guarantee provided by the Federal government.\nAmong the currently available government-impelled cargoes is a contract the Company has with the Government of Israel (\u201cGOI\u201d) to deliver fuel through December 31, 2020, which the GOI funds with grants from the U.S. government. The Company must seek other government-impelled cargoes to supplement the GOI business, however, there is no assurance the Company will be able to secure such cargoes. In addition, if the Company is unable to retain the GOI business, or is unable to obtain significant other charters for these vessels, the Company may no longer be able to participate in the MSP and the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nThe Company operates three Jones Act MR Shuttle Tankers, two of which are currently operating as shuttle tankers serving offshore oil installations in the Gulf of Mexico. Modifications made to enable these tankers to perform the specialized service of a shuttle tanker required the Company to incur substantial capital costs, which in turn allow the Company to earn a premium to market rates earned by conventional Jones Act tankers. While shuttle tankers can serve as conventional tankers without further modification, future reduction in the demand for specialized shuttle tanker services could limit the Company\u2019s ability to earn such premiums, which could adversely affect the financial results of the Company as compared to historical results.\nIn the highly competitive Jones Act market, OSG may not be able to compete effectively for charters.\nThe Company\u2019s vessels are employed in a highly competitive market. Competition arises from other vessel owners, including major oil companies, which may have substantially greater resources than OSG does. Competition for the transportation of crude oil and other petroleum products depends on price; location; size, age and condition of vessel; and the acceptability of the vessel operator to the charterer. To the extent OSG enters into new geographic regions or provides new services, it may not be able to compete profitably. New markets may involve competitive factors that differ from those of the Company\u2019s current markets, and the competitors in those markets may have greater financial strength and capital resources than OSG does.\nOSG may not be able to renew Time Charters when they expire or enter into new Time Charters.\nOSG\u2019s ability to renew expiring contracts or obtain new charters will depend on the prevailing market conditions at the time of renewal. As of December 31, 2019, OSG employed 19 vessels on Time Charters, with 14 of those expiring in 2020, three expiring in 2021, one expiring in 2022 and one expiring in 2025. The Company\u2019s existing Time Charters may not be renewed at comparable rates or if renewed or entered into, those new contracts may be at less favorable rates. In addition, there may be a gap in employment of vessels between current charters and subsequent charters. If at a time when OSG is seeking to arrange new charters for its vessels, market participants expect that less capacity will be necessary in the future (for example, if it is expected that oil and natural gas prices will decrease in the future, which could suggest that future oil and gas production levels will decline from then-current levels), OSG may not be able to obtain charters at attractive rates or at all. If, upon expiration of the existing Time Charter, OSG is unable to obtain Time Charters or Voyage Charters at desirable rates, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\n23 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nOSG may not realize the benefits it expects from future acquisitions or other strategic transactions it may make.\nOSG\u2019s business strategy includes ongoing efforts to engage in material acquisitions of assets or ownership interests in entities in the tanker industry and of individual tankers. The Company has recently entered into a 10-year bareboat lease of a 20-year old product tanker which entered the market in the second quarter of 2019 and took delivery of two 50,000 DWT class product and chemical tankers in the third quarter of 2019. The Company is also constructing two new 204,000 bbl barges which will come into the market in 2020. The success of OSG\u2019s acquisitions will depend upon a number of factors, some of which may not be within its control. These factors include OSG\u2019s ability to:\n\u25cf identify suitable tankers and/or shipping companies for acquisitions at attractive prices, which may not be possible if asset prices rise too quickly;\n\u25cf obtain financing;\n\u25cf identify businesses engaged in managing, operating or owning tankers for acquisitions or joint ventures;\n\u25cf integrate any acquired tankers or businesses successfully with the OSG\u2019s then-existing operations; and\n\u25cf enhance OSG\u2019s customer base.\nOSG intends to finance any future acquisitions by using available cash from operations, entering into leases and through incurrence of debt or bridge financing, either of which may increase its leverage ratios, or by issuing equity, which may have a dilutive impact on its existing stockholders. At any given time, OSG may be engaged in a number of discussions that may result in one or more acquisitions, some of which may be material to OSG as a whole. These opportunities require confidentiality and may involve negotiations that require quick responses by OSG. Although there can be no certainty that any of these discussions will result in definitive agreements or the completion of any transactions, the announcement of any such transaction may lead to increased volatility in the trading price of OSG\u2019s securities.\nAcquisitions and other transactions can also involve a number of special risks and challenges, including:\n\u25cf diversion of management time and attention from the Company\u2019s existing business and other business opportunities;\n\u25cf delays in closing or the inability to close an acquisition for any reason, including third-party consents or approvals;\n\u25cf any unanticipated negative impact on the Company of disclosed or undisclosed matters relating to any vessels or operations acquired; and\n\u25cf assumption of debt or other liabilities of the acquired business, including litigation related to the acquired business.\nThe success of acquisitions or strategic investments depends on the effective integration of newly acquired businesses or assets into OSG\u2019s current operations. Such integration is subject to risks and uncertainties, including realization of anticipated synergies and cost savings, the ability to retain and attract personnel and customers, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, risk of non-compliance with internal controls over financial reporting for an acquired company, in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the acquired company or asset. Further, if a portion of the purchase price of a business is attributable to goodwill and if the acquired business does not perform up to expectations at the time of the acquisition some or all of the goodwill may be written off, adversely affecting OSG\u2019s earnings.\nThe Company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from a limited number of customers, and the loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these customers could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s largest customers account for a significant portion of its revenues. The Company\u2019s top three customers comprised approximately 38% of the Company\u2019s revenues during 2019. The loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these customers could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n24 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nCertain potential customers will not use vessels older than a specified age, even if the vessels have been subsequently rebuilt.\nAll of the Company\u2019s existing ATBs were originally constructed more than 25 years ago with the exception of the OSG Vision/OSG 350, OSG Horizon/OSG 351, which were built between 2010 and 2011, respectively. The OSG Endurance and OSG Courageous tugs, which were built in 2011, will be paired with the Company\u2019s new barges expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2020 and fourth quarter of 2020. While all of these rebuilt tug-barge units were rebuilt and double-hulled since 1998 and are \u201cin-class,\u201d meaning the vessel has been certified by a Classification Society as being built and maintained in accordance with the rules of that Classification Society and complies with the applicable rules and regulations of the vessel\u2019s country of registry and applicable international conventions, some potential customers have stated that they will not charter vessels that are more than 20 years old, even if they have been rebuilt. Other customers may not continue to view rebuilt vessels as suitable. With an increase in the supply of newer vessels, customers may become more selective. If more customers differentiate rebuilt vessels, time charter rates for the Company\u2019s rebuilt ATBs will likely be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s significant operating leases could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced.\nThe Company\u2019s operating fleet includes ten vessels that have been chartered-in under operating leases. The significant operating leases of the Company in its various businesses expire at various points in the future and may not be replaced at all or on as favorable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s future financial position, results of operations and cash flow.\nThe Company is subject to credit risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts, and any failure by those counterparties to meet their obligations could cause the Company to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing revenues and earnings.\nThe Company has entered into, and in the future will enter into, various contracts, including charter agreements and other agreements associated with the operation of its vessels. The Company charters its vessels to other parties, who pay the company a daily rate of hire. The Company also enters COAs and Voyage Charters. Historically, the Company has not experienced material problems collecting charter hire, but the risk increases during economic downturns. Additionally, the Company enters into derivative contracts (interest rate swaps and caps) from time to time. As a result, the Company is subject to credit risks. The ability of each of the Company\u2019s counterparties to perform its obligations under a contract with it will depend on a number of factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control and may include, among other things, general economic conditions; availability of debt or equity financing; the condition of the maritime and offshore industries; the overall financial condition of the counterparty including the bankruptcy of the counterparty; charter rates received for specific types of vessels; and various expenses. Charterers are sensitive to the commodity markets and may be impacted by market forces affecting commodities such as oil. In addition, in depressed market conditions, the Company\u2019s charterers and customers may no longer need a vessel that is currently under charter or contract or may be able to obtain a comparable vessel at lower rates. As a result, the Company\u2019s customers may fail to pay charter hire or attempt to renegotiate charter rates. If the counterparties fail to meet their obligations, the Company could suffer losses on such contracts which would decrease revenues, cash flows and earnings.\nOperating costs and capital expenses will increase as the Company\u2019s vessels age and may also increase due to unanticipated events relating to secondhand vessels and the consolidation of suppliers.\nIn general, capital expenditures and other costs necessary for maintaining a vessel in good operating condition increase as the age of the vessel increases. As of December 31, 2019, the average age of the Company\u2019s total owned and operated fleet, with the exception of the Company\u2019s two rebuilt ATBs was 7.1 years, which is based on the vessels\u2019 year of rebuild, where applicable. Cargo insurance rates are also expected to increase with the age of a vessel. Accordingly, it is likely that the operating costs of OSG\u2019s currently operated vessels will increase. In addition, changes in governmental regulations and compliance with Classification Society standards may restrict the type of activities in which the vessels may engage and/or may require OSG to make additional expenditures for new equipment. Every commercial tanker must pass inspection by a Classification Society authorized by the vessel\u2019s country of registry. The Classification Society certifies that a tanker is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rule and regulations of the country of registry of the tanker and the international conventions of which that country is a number. If a Classification Society requires the Company to add equipment, OSG may be required to incur substantial costs or take its vessels out of service. Market conditions may not justify such expenditures or permit OSG to operate its older vessels profitably even if those vessels remain operational. If a vessel in OSG\u2019s fleet does not maintain its class and/or fails any survey, then it will be unemployable and unable to trade between ports, which would negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operation.\n25 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nFurthermore, recent mergers have reduced the number of available suppliers, resulting in fewer alternatives for sourcing key supplies. With respect to certain items, OSG is generally dependent upon the original equipment manufacturer for repair and replacement of the item or its spare parts. Supplier consolidation may result in a shortage of supplies and services, thereby increasing the cost of supplies or potentially inhibiting the ability of suppliers to deliver on time. These cost increases or delays could result in downtime, and delays in the repair and maintenance of the Company\u2019s vessels and have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company may face unexpected drydock costs for its vessels.\nVessels must be drydocked periodically for inspection and maintenance, and in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage. The cost of repairs and renewals required at each drydock are difficult to predict with certainty, can be substantial and the Company\u2019s insurance may not cover these costs. Vessels in drydock will generally not generate any income. Large drydocking expenses could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the time when a vessel is out of service for maintenance is determined by a number of factors including regulatory deadlines, market conditions, shipyard availability and customer requirements. Large drydocking expenses and longer than anticipated off-hire time could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTechnological innovation could reduce the Company\u2019s charter income and the value of the Company\u2019s vessels.\nThe charter rates and the value and operational life of a vessel are determined by a number of factors including the vessel\u2019s efficiency, operational flexibility and physical life. Efficiency includes speed, fuel economy and the ability to load and discharge cargo quickly. Flexibility includes the ability to enter harbors, utilize related docking facilities and pass through canals and straits. The length of a vessel\u2019s physical life is related to its original design and construction, its maintenance and the impact of the stress of operations. Competition from more technologically advanced vessels could adversely affect the amount of charter payments the Company receives for its vessels once their initial charters expire and the resale value of the Company\u2019s vessels could significantly decrease. As a result, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nInterruption, failure or breach of OSG\u2019s information technology and communications systems could impair its ability to operate and adversely affect its business.\nOSG is highly dependent on information technology systems. These dependencies include accounting, billing, disbursement, cargo booking and tracking, vessel scheduling and stowage, equipment tracking, customer service, banking, payroll and communication systems. Information technology and communication systems are subject to reliability issues, integration and compatibility concerns, and security-threatening intrusions. OSG may experience failures caused by the occurrence of a natural disaster, computer hacking or viruses or other unanticipated problems at OSG\u2019s facilities, aboard its vessels or at third-party locations. Any failure of OSG\u2019s or third-party systems could result in interruptions in service, reductions in its revenue and profits, damage to its reputation or liability for the release of confidential information.\nWe collect, store and transmit sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that of our clients, and personally identifiable information of our clients and employees, using both our information technology systems and those of third-party vendors. The secure storage, processing, maintenance, and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Our network, or those of our clients or third-party vendors, could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, and other security problems. Many companies have increasingly reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage. Cybersecurity issues, such as security breaches and computer viruses, affecting our information technology systems or those of our third-party vendors, could disrupt our business, result in the unintended disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs, and cause losses.\n26 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nWe may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. Security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches (including the inability of our third party vendors to prevent security breaches) could also cause existing clients to lose confidence in our systems and could adversely affect our reputation, cause losses to us or our clients, damage our brand, and increase our costs.\nDelays or disruptions in implementing new technological and management systems could impair the Company\u2019s ability to operate and adversely affect its business.\nThe Company is currently in the process of transitioning to a new software system for managing ship operations. In addition, from time to time the Company will implement or upgrade certain other technological resources utilized in running its business. Implementation of this new software system will have a significant impact on our business processes and information systems. The transition will require a significant investment in capital and personnel resources and the coordination of numerous software and system providers and internal business teams. The Company may experience difficulties as it manages these changes and transitions to the new system and upgrades its technological resources, including loss or corruption of data, delays, decreases in productivity as personnel implement and become familiar with new systems and processes, and unanticipated expenses. Additionally, the Company could be adversely affected if the new software system it is implementing for managing ship operations or other new or upgraded technological resource are defective, not installed properly, fail to perform as marketed or are not properly integrated into existing operations. In addition, the implementation of a new system may not result in improvements that outweigh the cost of implementation. System implementation failures or operational failures, including unauthorized access by third parties to our new software system (which could have the effects described in the preceding risk factor) and could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, and ability to operate in a complex industry. Moreover, difficulties in implementing the new software could disrupt the Company\u2019s operations or divert management\u2019s attention from key strategic initiatives.\nWe could face significant liability if one or more multiemployer plans in which we participate is reported to have underfunded liabilities and we withdraw from participation in one or more multiemployer pension plans in which we participate.\nThe Company is a party to collective-bargaining agreements that requires contributions to three jointly managed (Company and union) multiemployer pension plans covering seagoing personnel of U.S. Flag vessels. Our required contributions to these plans could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans, the inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, low interest rates, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. Certain of these multiemployer plans are currently underfunded. Significantly underfunded pension plans are required to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their under-funding. As a result, our required contributions to these plans may increase in the future. In addition, a termination of our voluntary withdrawal from or a mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan would require us to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of such multiemployer pension plan\u2019s unfunded vested liabilities. See Note 16, \u201cPension and Other Post Retirement Benefit Plans,\u201d to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 for additional information. Requirements to pay increased contributions or withdrawal liabilities could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and results of operations.\n27 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nThe Company may have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled employees and is dependent on unionized employees.\nOSG\u2019s success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of its key personnel. The loss of the services of key personnel or the Company\u2019s inability to attract, motivate and retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2019, OSG had approximately 713 employees, of which 496 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Employees.\u201d OSG could be adversely affected by actions taken by employees of OSG or other companies in related industries (including third parties providing services to OSG) against efforts by management to control labor costs, restrain wage or benefits increases or modify work practices or the failure of OSG or other companies in its industry to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud.\nThe Company maintains a system of internal controls to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The process of designing and implementing effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires the Company to anticipate and react to changes in its business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy its reporting obligations as a public company.\nAny system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase the Company\u2019s operating costs and harm its business. Furthermore, investors\u2019 perceptions that the Company\u2019s internal controls are inadequate or that the Company is unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis may harm its stock price.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe United States government enacted tax reform in 2017 and continues to provide regulatory guidance related to tax reform provisions, and state authorities continue to provide guidance around its application to tax reform, that could impact future effective tax rates favorably or unfavorably affected by changes in tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Such changes could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nThe Company\u2019s business would be adversely affected if it failed to comply with the Jones Act\u2019s limitations on U.S. coastwise trade, or if these limitations were waived, modified or repealed, or if changes in international trade agreements were to occur.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s operations are conducted in the U.S. coastwise trade and are governed by U.S. federal laws commonly known as the \u201cJones Act\u201d. The Jones Act restricts waterborne transportation of goods between points in the United States to vessels meeting certain requirements, including ownership and control by \u201cU.S. Citizens\u201d as defined thereunder. The Company is responsible for monitoring the foreign ownership of its common stock and other interests to ensure compliance with the Jones Act. The Company could lose the privilege of owning and operating vessels in the Jones Act trade if non-U.S. Citizens were to own or control, in the aggregate, more than 25% of the equity interests in the Company. Such loss would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. In addition, under certain circumstances failure to comply with the Jones Act may result in the Company being deemed to have violated other U.S. federal laws that prohibit a foreign transfer of U.S. documented vessels without government approval, resulting in severe penalties, including permanent loss of U.S. coastwise trading privileges or forfeiture of the vessels deemed transferred, and fines.\n28 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nAdditionally, maritime transportation services are currently excluded from the General Agreement on Trade in Services (\u201cGATS\u201d) and are the subject of reservations by the United States in the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d) and other international free trade agreements. If maritime transportation services were included in GATS, NAFTA or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise repealed or altered, the transportation of maritime cargo between U.S. ports could be opened to international flag or foreign built vessels. Recently, particularly with regard to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Irma, interest groups have lobbied Congress, and legislation has been introduced, to repeal certain provisions of the Jones Act or to grant extensive waivers so as to facilitate international flag competition for trades and cargoes currently reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under the Jones Act. The Company expects that continued efforts will be made to modify, repeal, or waive the Jones Act. Because international vessels may have lower construction costs, wage rates and operating costs, this could significantly increase competition in the coastwise trade, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe U.S. government could requisition the Company\u2019s vessels during a period of war or emergency, which may negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash.\nThe U.S. government could requisition one or more of the Company\u2019s vessels for title or hire, typically occurring during a period of war or emergency. Requisition for title or hire occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and becomes the owner or the charterer at dictated charter rates. Two OSG vessels participate in the U.S. Maritime Security Program, which ensures that militarily useful U.S. Flag vessels are available to the U.S. Department of Defense in the event of war or national emergency. Under the program, OSG receives an annual fee, subject in each case to annual Congressional appropriations, in exchange for a guarantee that the ships will be made available to the U.S. government in the time of war or national emergency. The U.S. government requisition of one or more of the Company\u2019s vessels may impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash if the charter rates we receive from the government while on requisition are less than the charter rates that are being replaced, or if the government refuses to pay the requisition charter rate, in which case we would seek recovery through our insurance policies.\nCompliance with complex laws, regulations, and, in particular, environmental laws or regulations may adversely affect OSG\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are affected by extensive and changing international, national and local environmental protection laws, regulations, treaties, conventions and standards. These requirements are designed to reduce the risk of oil spills and water pollution and to regulate air emissions, including emission of greenhouse gases. These requirements impose significant capital and operating costs on OSG, including those related to engine adjustments and ballast water treatment.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations also can affect the resale value or significantly reduce the useful lives of the Company\u2019s vessels, require a reduction in carrying capacity, ship modifications or operational changes or restrictions (and related increased operating costs) or retirement of service, lead to decreased availability or higher cost of insurance coverage for environmental matters or result in the denial of access to, or detention in, certain jurisdictional waters or ports. Under local, national and foreign laws, as well as international treaties and conventions, OSG could incur material liabilities, including cleanup obligations, in the event that there is a release of petroleum or other hazardous substances from its vessels or otherwise in connection with its operations. OSG could be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to the release of or exposure to hazardous materials associated with its current or historic operations. Violations of or liabilities under environmental requirements also can result in substantial penalties, fines and other sanctions, including in certain instances, seizure or detention of the Company\u2019s vessels.\n29 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nOSG could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines, penalties, third-party claims and natural resource damages, as the result of an oil spill or liabilities under environmental laws. The Company is subject to the oversight of several government agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation. OPA 90 affects all vessel owners shipping oil or hazardous material to, from or within the United States. OPA 90 allows for potentially unlimited liability without regard to fault for owners, operators and bareboat charterers of vessels for oil pollution in U.S. waters. Similarly, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, as amended, which has been adopted by most countries outside of the United States, imposes liability for oil pollution in international waters. OPA 90 expressly permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to hazardous materials and oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries. Coastal states in the United States have enacted pollution prevention liability and response laws, many providing for unlimited liability.\nIn order to comply with laws and regulations, shipowners likely will incur substantial additional capital and/or operating expenditures to meet new regulatory requirements, to develop contingency arrangements for potential spills and to obtain insurance coverage. Key regulatory initiatives that are anticipated to require substantial additional capital and/or operating expenditures in the next several years include more stringent limits on the sulfur content of fuel oil for vessels operating in waters not already considered emissions control areas and more stringent requirements for management and treatment of ballast water.\nThe Company expects to install ballast water treatment systems on its vessels at substantial capital cost and incur increased operating expenses between 2020 and 2023. Although the Company has performed due diligence in choosing the particular systems, there is no assurance that the technologies chosen will perform as expected or be installed without delays.\nThe Company continues to be in full compliance with the USCG\u2019s phase-in schedule for ballast water treatment systems and has received extensions from the USCG for six vessels. The EPA determined in 2013 that it will not issue extensions under the VGP but stated that vessels that meet certain conditions, including having received the USCG extensions, would be a \u201clow enforcement priority\u201d. While the six vessels with USCG extensions are not in compliance with the EPA\u2019s phase-in schedule, OSG believes that its vessels will meet the conditions for a low enforcement priority.\u201d However, no assurance is given that EPA will not change their position. If the EPA determines to enforce the limits for such vessels, such action could have a material adverse effect on OSG. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Environmental, Safety and Security Matters.\u201d\nOther government regulation of vessels, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental requirements, can be expected to become stricter in the future and require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures on its vessels to keep them in compliance, or even to scrap or sell certain vessels altogether. Such expenditures could result in financial and operational impacts that may be material to OSG\u2019s financial statements. Additionally, the failure of a shipowner or bareboat charterer to comply with local, domestic and foreign regulations may subject it to increased liability, may invalidate existing insurance or decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. If any of our vessels are denied access to, or are detained in, certain ports, reputation, business, financial results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nIncidents involving highly publicized oil spills and other mishaps involving vessels can be expected in the tanker industry, and such events could be expected to result in the adoption of even stricter laws and regulations, which could limit the Company\u2019s operations or its ability to do business and which could have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s business, financial results and cash flows. In addition, the Company is required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to its operations. The Company believes its vessels are maintained in good condition in compliance with present regulatory requirements, are operated in compliance with applicable safety and environmental laws and regulations and are insured against usual risks for such amounts as the Company\u2019s management deems appropriate. The vessels\u2019 operating certificates and licenses are renewed periodically during each vessel\u2019s required annual survey. However, government regulation of tankers, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental impact, may change in the future and require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures with respect to its ships to keep them in compliance.\n30 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nDue to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries, including the United States, and international organizations, including the IMO and the European Union, have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These regulatory measures include, among others, adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. Such actions could result in significant financial and operational impacts on the Company\u2019s business, including requiring OSG to install new emission controls, acquire allowances or pay taxes related to its greenhouse gas emissions, or administer and manage a greenhouse gas emission program. The Company is calculating and reporting greenhouse gas emissions on voyages to and from EU ports under the EU\u2019s Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) scheme, and a similar requirement has been expanded to all vessels engaged on international voyage under a similar IMO program. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Environmental, Safety and Security Matters.\u201d In addition to the added costs, the concern over climate change and regulatory measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may reduce global demand for oil and oil products, which would have an adverse effect on OSG\u2019s business, financial results and cash flows.\nThe employment of the Company\u2019s vessels could be adversely affected by an inability to clear the oil majors\u2019 risk assessment process.\nOur industry is heavily regulated. In addition, the major oil companies have developed a strict due diligence process for selecting their shipping partners out of concerns for the environmental impact of spills. This vetting process has evolved into a sophisticated and comprehensive risk assessment of both the vessel manager and the vessel. The Company\u2019s charterers require that the Company\u2019s vessels and the technical managers pass vetting inspections and management audits. The Company\u2019s failure to maintain any of its vessels to these standards could put the Company in breach of the applicable charter agreement and lead to termination of such agreement thereby adversely affecting the revenues of the Company.\nThe Company may be subject to litigation and government inquiries or investigations that, if not resolved in the Company\u2019s favor and not sufficiently covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on it.\nThe Company has been and is, from time to time, involved in various litigation matters and is subject to government inquiries and investigations. These matters may include, among other things, contract disputes, personal injury claims, environmental claims or proceedings, asbestos and other toxic tort claims, employment matters, governmental claims for taxes or duties, and other disputes that arise in the ordinary course of the Company\u2019s business. The Company believes it has sufficient insurance coverage for the majority, though not all, of these cases.\nAlthough the Company intends to defend these matters vigorously, it cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any such matter, and the ultimate outcome of these matters or the potential costs to resolve them could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to OSG\u2019s rules and practices in dealing with its customers, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s future operating results. Insurance may not be applicable or sufficient in all cases. Because litigation is inherently uncertain, the Company\u2019s estimates for contingent liabilities may be insufficient to cover the actual liabilities from such claims, resulting in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d and Note 18, \u201cContingencies,\u201d to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statement and Supplementary Data.\u201d\n31 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nMaritime claimants could arrest OSG\u2019s vessels, which could interrupt cash flows.\nCrew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against that vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lien holder may enforce its lien by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arrest or attachment of one or more of the Company\u2019s vessels could interrupt OSG\u2019s cash flow and require it to pay a significant amount of money to have the arrest lifted. Claimants could try to assert \u201csister ship\u201d liability against one vessel in the Company\u2019s fleet for claims relating to another vessel in its fleet which, if successful, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTransfers or issuances of the Company\u2019s equity may impair or reduce the Company\u2019s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes in the future.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. An \u201cownership change\u201d is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50% of a corporation\u2019s stock over a rolling three-year period by stockholders that own (directly or indirectly) 5% or more of the stock of a corporation or arising from a new issuance of stock by a corporation. If an ownership change occurs, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the use of pre-ownership change NOLs, credits and certain other tax attributes to offset taxable income earned after the ownership change. The annual limitation is equal to the product of the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate and the value of the company\u2019s stock immediately before the ownership change. This annual limitation may be adjusted to reflect any unused annual limitation for prior years and certain recognized built-in gains and losses for the year. In addition, Section 383 generally limits the amount of tax liability in any post-ownership change year that can be reduced by pre-ownership change tax credit carryforwards. If the Company were to undergo an \u201cownership change,\u201d it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to the Common Stock and Warrants\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s securities fluctuates significantly.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s securities fluctuates substantially. You may not be able to resell your Class A common stock or Class A warrants at or above the price you paid for such securities due to a number of factors, some of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including the occurrence of the risks described herein. The falling price of the Company\u2019s equity securities may expose the Company to securities class action litigation, which could result in substantial cost and the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nThe ability to sell warrants may be limited and the exercise of outstanding warrants may result in substantial dilution to the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nThe Company\u2019s Class A warrants are currently traded as \u201crestricted securities\u201d in the over-the-counter market and in privately negotiated transactions among individual holders pursuant to exemptions from the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Transactions are reported as taking place only sporadically. The liquidity of any market that may develop for the Class A warrants, the ability to sell the Class A warrants and the price at which such securities would sell are all uncertain.\nThe Company has outstanding Class A warrants with an exercise price of $0.01 per share exercisable into shares of Class A common stock. If exercised, the shares of Class A common stock underlying these warrants would represent approximately 4% of the Company\u2019s outstanding Class A common stock. Accordingly, any such exercise may result in substantial dilution to the Company\u2019s stockholders.\n32 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is subject to restrictions on foreign ownership, which could have a negative impact on the transferability of the Company\u2019s common stock, its liquidity and market value, and on a change of control of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws authorize its Board of Directors to establish certain rules, policies and procedures, including procedures with respect to transfer of shares, to assist in monitoring and maintaining compliance with the Jones Act ownership restrictions. In order to provide a reasonable margin for compliance with the Jones Act at least 77% (the \u201cMinimum Percentage\u201d) of the outstanding shares of each class of capital stock of the Company must be owned by U.S. citizens. To assist the Company in complying with the Jones Act citizenship requirements, the Company participates in the Depository Trust Company\u2019s (\u201cDTC\u201d) Seg-100 program. Under this system, shares of our common stock beneficially owned by non-U.S. citizens through DTC must be deposited in a segregated account known as Seg-100.\nAny purported transfer by a foreign holder of equity interests in the Company that cause the percentage of outstanding shares of a class of capital stock of the Company to fall below the Minimum Percentage will be rendered ineffective to transfer the equity interests or any voting, dividend or other rights associated with such interest in accordance with the rights afforded in the Jones Act and contained in the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws.\nThe percentage of U.S. citizenship ownership of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock fluctuates based on daily trading, and at times in the past, has declined to the Minimum Percentage. At and during such time that the Minimum Percentage is reached, the Company will not issue any further shares of such class of common stock or approve transfers of such class of common stock to non-U.S. citizens. If a foreign owner\u2019s acquisition causes total foreign ownership of our common stock to exceed the limit set forth in our Citizenship Policies, currently 23%, DTC will not permit additional shares to be deposited in the Company\u2019s Seg-100 account. This is an additional risk that foreign owners of our common stock bear.\nThe existence and enforcement of these ownership restrictions could have an adverse impact on the liquidity or market value of the Company\u2019s equity securities. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the ownership restrictions could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s outstanding warrants are not subject to the above ownership restrictions, but the warrants include provisions limiting the right of non-U.S. citizens to exercise warrants if the shares of common stock that would be issued upon exercise would cause the percentage of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock held by U.S. citizens to decline below the Minimum Percentage.\nOSG is a holding company and depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to distribute funds to it in order to satisfy its financial obligations or pay dividends.\nOverseas Shipholding Group, Inc. is a holding company and its subsidiaries conduct all of its operations and own all of its operating assets. It has no significant assets other than the equity interests in its subsidiaries. As a result, its ability to satisfy its financial obligations or pay dividends is dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to distribute funds to it. In addition, the terms of the term loan, due 2023, term loans, due 2024, and term loan, due 2026, restrict the ability of OBS and its subsidiaries to distribute funds to Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nSome provisions of Delaware law and the Company\u2019s governing documents could influence its ability to effect a change of control.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law and contained in the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of the Company. In addition, these provisions could make it more difficult to bring about a change in the composition of the Company\u2019s board of directors. For example, the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws:\n33 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\n\u25cf give the sole ability to then-current members of its board of directors to fill a vacancy on the board of directors;\n\u25cf require the affirmative vote of two-thirds or more of the combined voting power of the outstanding shares of its capital stock in order to amend or repeal certain provisions of its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws; and\n\u25cf establish advance notice requirements for nomination for elections to its board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nSeparately, the Company has elected to opt out of Section 203 (\u201cSection 203\u201d) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), which restricts certain business combinations between a Delaware corporation and an \u201cinterested stockholder.\u201d Accordingly, the Company will be able to enter into such transactions with its principal stockholders without complying with the requirements of Section 203. The election to opt out of Section 203 could deprive certain stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the Company, particularly if it enters into a transaction with an \u201cinterested stockholder.\u201d\nSecurities analysts may not initiate coverage to cover the Company\u2019s securities, and this may have a negative impact on their market price.\nThe trading market for the Company\u2019s securities will depend in part on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about the Company and its business. The Company does not have any control over securities analysts, and they may not initiate coverage or continue to cover the Company\u2019s securities. If securities analysts do not cover the Company\u2019s securities, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect their market price. If the Company is covered by securities analysts, and the Company\u2019s securities are the subject of an unfavorable report, the Company\u2019s securities prices would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover the Company or fails to publish regular reports on the Company, the Company could lose visibility in the financial markets, which may cause the price or trading volume of the Company\u2019s securities to decline.\n34 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.", "PERMNO": 51457, "SIC": 4412, "TIC": "OSG"}
