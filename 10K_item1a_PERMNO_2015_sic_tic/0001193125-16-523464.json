{"cik": "1013238", "company": "ARADIGM CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nExcept for historical information contained herein, the discussion of this Annual Report on form 10-K contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding timing and results of clinical trials, the maintenance and establishment of corporate partnering arrangements, the anticipated commercial introduction of our products and the timing of our cash requirements. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any such forward-looking statements. Potential risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, those mentioned in this report and in particular the factors described below.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe results of later stage clinical trials of our product candidates may not be as favorable as earlier trials and that could result in additional costs and delay or prevent commercialization of our products.\nAlthough we believe the limited and preliminary data we have regarding our potential products are encouraging, the results of initial preclinical safety testing and clinical trials do not necessarily predict the results that we will get from subsequent or more extensive preclinical safety testing and clinical trials. Pre-clinical safety testing and clinical trials of our product candidates may not demonstrate that they are safe and effective to the extent necessary to obtain collaborative partnerships and/or regulatory approvals. Many companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after receiving promising results in earlier trials. If we cannot adequately demonstrate through pre-clinical studies and the clinical trial process that a therapeutic product we are developing is safe and effective, regulatory approval of that product would be delayed or prevented, which would impair our reputation, increase our costs and prevent us from earning revenues. For example, while both of our Phase 2b clinical trials (ORBIT-1 and ORBIT-2) with inhaled ciprofloxacin showed promising initial efficacy and safety results in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (BE) and our Phase 2a clinical trials showed promising results in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and BE, there is no guarantee that longer term studies, such as our Phase 3 studies (ORBIT-3 and ORBIT-4), in larger patient populations will confirm these results or that we will be able to conduct studies that will provide satisfactory evidence of all efficacy and safety endpoints required by the regulatory authorities.\nWe are a development-stage company and will require substantial capital to complete the development of our product candidates and commercialize them.\nWe will need to raise additional capital prior to approval and commercialization of our leading product candidate Pulmaquin. We cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital when needed on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. All of our potential products are in research or development. Our potential drug products require extensive research and development, including pre-clinical and clinical testing. Our potential products also may involve lengthy regulatory reviews before they can be sold. Because none of our product candidates has yet received approval by the FDA, we cannot assure you that our research and development efforts will be successful, any of our potential products will be proven safe and effective, or regulatory clearance or approval to sell any of our potential products will be obtained. We cannot assure you that any of our potential products can be manufactured in commercial quantities with quality systems acceptable to the regulatory authorities at an acceptable cost or marketed successfully. We may abandon the development of some or all of our product candidates at any time and without prior notice. We must incur substantial up-front expenses to develop and commercialize products and failure to achieve commercial feasibility, demonstrate safety, achieve clinical efficacy, obtain regulatory approval or successfully manufacture and market products will negatively impact our business. Running clinical trials and developing an investigational drug for commercialization involve significant expense, and any unexpected delays or other issues in the development process can result in significant additional expense.\nOur dependence on collaborators and other third parties may delay or require that we terminate certain of our programs, and any such delay or termination would harm our business prospects and stock price.\nOur commercialization strategy for certain of our product candidates depends on our ability to enter into or maintain agreements with collaborators (such as the Grifols collaboration transaction) and to obtain assistance and funding for the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. Supporting diligence activities conducted by potential collaborators and negotiating the financial and other terms of a collaboration agreement are long and complex processes with uncertain results. Collaborations may involve greater uncertainty for us, as we have less control over certain aspects of our collaborative programs than we would over a proprietary development and commercialization program. We may determine that continuing a collaboration under the terms provided is not in our best interest and, if we are able to under the terms of the agreement, we may terminate the collaboration. Our collaborators could delay or terminate their agreements with us, and our products subject to collaborative arrangements may never be successfully commercialized. Under our existing collaboration agreement with Grifols, we have granted Grifols exclusive rights with respect to inhaled ciprofloxacin compounds for other indications besides the treatment of non-CF BE, and we have limited ability to terminate that agreement.\nFurther, our present or future collaborators may pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products either on their own or in collaboration with others, including our competitors, and the priorities or focus of our collaborators may shift such that our programs receive less attention or resources than we would like, or they may be terminated altogether. Any such actions by our collaborators may adversely affect our business prospects and ability to earn revenues. In addition, we could have disputes with our present or future collaborators, such as the interpretation of terms in our agreements. Any such disagreements could lead to delays in the development or commercialization of any potential products or could result in time-consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration, which may not be resolved in our favor.\nEven with respect to certain other programs that we intend to commercialize ourselves, or programs that Grifols has declined its exclusive right to fund and commercialize, we may enter into agreements with collaborators to share in the burden of conducting clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing our product candidates or products. In addition, our ability to apply our proprietary technologies to develop proprietary drugs will depend on our ability to establish and maintain licensing arrangements or other collaborative arrangements with the holders of proprietary rights to such drugs. We may not be able to establish such arrangements on favorable terms or at all, and our future collaborative arrangements may not be successful.\nWe are using contract research organizations in order to conduct our global Phase 3 clinical trials and for other testing activities. We may not be able to maintain satisfactory contract research arrangements. If we are not, there may be significant delays before we find an alternative contract research organization or we may not find an alternative contract research organization at all. If our contract research organizations are delayed in their activities or issues are uncovered regarding the quality of the data provided by the contract research organization it could result in significant delays in our Pulmaquin clinical program and adversely impact our ability to file for regulatory approval of our product candidate.\nBecause our inhaled ciprofloxacin programs may rely on the FDA\u2019s and European Medicines Agency\u2019s grant of orphan drug designation for potential market exclusivity, the product may not be able to obtain market exclusivity and could be barred from the market in the US for up to seven years or European Union for up to ten years.\nThe FDA has granted orphan drug designation for our liposomal ciprofloxacin drug product candidate for the management of CF and BE and to our ciprofloxacin for inhalation for the management of bronchiectasis. FDA also granted orphan drug designation to our proprietary drug product of liposomal ciprofloxacin for the management of CF. Orphan drug designation is intended to encourage research and development of new therapies for diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States. The designation provides the opportunity to obtain market exclusivity, even in the absence of a granted patent or other intellectual property protection, for seven years from the date of the FDA\u2019s approval of an NDA. However, the market exclusivity is granted only to the first chemical entity to be approved by the FDA for a given indication. Therefore, if another similar inhaled ciprofloxacin product were to be approved by the FDA for a CF or BE indication before our product, then we may be blocked from launching our product in the United States for seven years, unless we are able to demonstrate to the FDA clinical superiority of our product on the basis of safety or efficacy. For example, Bayer HealthCare is developing an inhaled dry powder formulation of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of respiratory infections in CF and BE. Bayer has obtained orphan drug status for their inhaled powder formulation of ciprofloxacin in the United States for the treatment of BE and in the United States and European Union for the treatment of CF.\nIn August 2009, the European Medicines Agency granted orphan drug designation to our inhaled liposomal ciprofloxacin drug product candidate Lipoquin (ARD-3100) for the treatment of lung infections associated with CF. Under European guidelines, Orphan Medicinal Product Designation provides 10 years of potential market exclusivity if the product candidate is the first product candidate for the indication approved for marketing in the EU. We may seek to develop additional products that incorporate drugs that have received orphan drug designations for specific indications. In each case, if our product is not the first to be approved by the FDA or European Medicines Agency for a given orphan indication, we may not be able to access the target market in the United States and/or the EU, which would adversely affect our ability to earn revenues.\nWe have a history of losses, we expect to incur losses for at least the foreseeable future, and we may never attain or maintain profitability.\nWe have never been profitable and have incurred significant losses in each year since our inception. As of December 31, 2015, we have an accumulated deficit of approximately $405.5 million. We have not had any direct product sales and do not anticipate receiving revenues from the sale of any of our products for at least the next few years, if ever. While our agreement with Grifols, which includes reimbursement of the majority of development expenses associated with our Pulmaquin program, has resulted in reduced operating expenses and capital expenditures, we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we:\n\u2022\ncontinue drug product development efforts;\n\u2022\nconduct preclinical testing and clinical trials;\n\u2022\npursue additional applications for our existing delivery technologies; and\n\u2022\noutsource the commercial-scale production of our products.\nTo achieve and sustain profitability, we must, alone or with others such as our partner Grifols, successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, manufacture, market and sell our products. We expect to incur substantial expenses in our efforts to develop and commercialize products and we may never generate sufficient product or contract research revenues to become profitable or to sustain profitability.\nFor our lead product candidate, Pulmaquin, regulatory authorities have requested additional animal toxicology prior to product approval for bronchiectasis (BE). Our Phase 3 clinical trials in BE may be successful but the results of these animal toxicology studies may be unacceptable to the regulatory authorities and may delay or prevent the approval of Pulmaquin for BE.\nAlthough we have already submitted a substantial amount of safety data to the regulatory authorities on Pulmaquin and we also have conducted a variety of preclinical studies to support our product development, regulatory authorities have requested that we conduct a 2 year carcinogenicity study in rats with inhaled Pulmaquin prior to product approval for BE. This study is currently underway. A 9 month inhalation safety study in dogs may also be needed to support approval for marketing this product for BE in the U.S. and the EU. We have taken the initiative to conduct this study. Although this study has been completed and the final audited study report has been submitted to the FDA we do not know if the FDA will require further toxicology studies. Longer term animal safety studies may produce toxicity findings that were not found in shorter, earlier studies, which could prevent commercialization of Pulmaquin or could necessitate the conduct of further animal safety studies, leading to delays and additional costs. Toxicology findings from animal studies may also be the reason for more extensive safety monitoring in humans.\nIf our present or future clinical trials are delayed for any reason, we would incur additional costs and delay the potential receipt of revenues.\nBefore we or any current or future collaborators can file for regulatory approval for the commercial sale of our potential products, the FDA will require extensive preclinical safety testing and clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy. Completing clinical trials in a timely manner depends on many factors. Delays in completing our present or future clinical trials may result in increased costs, program delays, or both, and the loss of potential revenues.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, including the requirement of approval before any of our product candidates can be marketed. We may not obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates on a timely basis, or at all.\nWe and our products are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the federal government, principally the FDA, and by state and local government agencies. Both before and after regulatory approval, the development, testing, manufacture, quality control, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution and export of our potential products are subject to regulation. Pharmaceutical products that are marketed abroad are also subject to regulation by foreign governments. Our products cannot be marketed in the United States without FDA approval. The process for obtaining FDA approval for drug products is generally lengthy, expensive and uncertain. In September 2014, we were granted Fast Track Designation for Pulmaquin for non-CF BE patients with chronic lung infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, The FDA gives Fast Track status to facilitate the development of new drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs, with the goal of getting important new drugs to patients earlier. However, having Fast Track Designation is no guarantee that the approval process will actually result in a faster or more streamlined process and to date, we have not sought or received approval from the FDA or any corresponding foreign authority for any of our drug product candidates.\nThe approval process is costly, time-consuming and uncertain. We, or our collaborators, may not be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all, for any of our potential products. Even if granted, regulatory approvals may include significant limitations on the uses for which products may be\nmarketed. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can, among other things, result in warning letters, imposition of civil penalties or other monetary payments, delay in approving or refusal to approve a product candidate, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval, product recall or seizure, operating restrictions, interruption of clinical trials or manufacturing, injunctions and criminal prosecution.\nRegulatory authorities may delay or not approve our product candidates even if the product candidates meet safety and efficacy endpoints in clinical trials or the approvals may be too limited for us to earn sufficient revenues.\nThe FDA and other foreign regulatory agencies can delay approval of, or refuse to approve, our product candidates for a variety of reasons, including failure to meet safety and/or efficacy endpoints in our clinical trials. Our pharmaceutical product candidates may not be approved even if they achieve their endpoints in clinical trials. Regulatory agencies, including the FDA, may disagree with our trial design and our interpretations of data from preclinical studies and clinical trials. Even if a product candidate is approved, it may be approved for fewer or more limited indications than requested or the approval may be subject to the performance of significant post-marketing studies that can be long and costly. In addition, regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates. Any limitation, condition or denial of approval would have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations.\nEven if we are granted initial FDA approval for any of our product candidates, we may not be able to maintain such approval, which would reduce our revenues.\nEven if we are granted initial regulatory approval for a product candidate, the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies can limit or withdraw product approvals for a variety of reasons, including failure to comply with regulatory requirements, changes in regulatory requirements, problems with manufacturing facilities or processes or the occurrence of unforeseen problems, such as the discovery of previously undiscovered side effects. If we are able to obtain any product approvals, they may be limited or withdrawn or we may be unable to remain in compliance with regulatory requirements. Both before and after approval we, our present and future collaborators and our products are subject to a number of additional requirements. For example, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, certain manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims are subject to additional FDA review and approval. Advertising and other promotional material must comply with FDA requirements. We, our collaborators and our manufacturers will be subject to continuing review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other authorities, where applicable, and must comply with ongoing requirements, including the FDA\u2019s GMP requirements. Once the FDA approves a product, a manufacturer must provide certain updated safety and efficacy information, submit copies of promotional materials to the FDA and make certain other required reports. Product approvals may be withdrawn if regulatory requirements are not complied with or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following approval. Any limitation or withdrawal of approval of any of our products could delay or prevent sales of our products, which would adversely affect our revenues. Further continuing regulatory requirements may involve expensive ongoing monitoring and testing requirements.\nWe will have to depend on contract manufacturers and collaborators: if they do not perform as expected, our revenues and customer relations will suffer.\nWe intend to use contract manufacturers to produce our products. We may not be able to maintain satisfactory contract manufacturing arrangements. If we are not, there may be a significant delay before we find an alternative contract manufacturer or we may not find an alternative contract manufacturer at all. Further, we, our contract manufacturers and our collaborators are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s GMP requirements that relate to product testing, quality assurance, manufacturing and maintaining records and documentation. We and our contract manufacturers or our collaborators may not be able to comply with the applicable GMP and other FDA regulatory requirements for manufacturing, which could result in an enforcement or other action, prevent commercialization of our product candidates and impair our reputation and results of operations.\nIf any products that we or our collaborators may develop do not attain adequate market acceptance by healthcare professionals and patients, our business prospects and results of operations will suffer.\nEven if we or our collaborators successfully develop one or more products, such products may not be commercially acceptable to healthcare professionals and patients, who will have to choose our products over alternative products for the same disease indications, and many of these alternative products will be more established than ours. For our products to be commercially viable we will need to demonstrate to healthcare professionals and patients that our products afford benefits to the patients that are cost-effective as compared to the benefits of alternative therapies. Our ability to demonstrate this depends on a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe demonstration of efficacy and safety in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe existence, prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022\nthe potential or perceived advantages or disadvantages compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe timing of market entry relative to competitive treatments;\n\u2022\nthe pricing relative to competitive products;\n\u2022\nthe relative cost, convenience, product dependability and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nthe strength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022\nthe sufficiency of coverage and reimbursement of our product candidates by governmental and other third-party payors; and\n\u2022\nthe product labeling or product insert required by the FDA or regulatory authorities in other countries.\nOur product revenues will be adversely affected if, due to these or other factors, the products we or our collaborators are able to commercialize do not gain significant market acceptance.\nWe are in the early stages of development for our inhaled nicotine product and commercialization of this product cannot be assured.\nWhile the preliminary development work and early testing of the commercial potential of this direct-to-consumer product have been favorable, there are many significant issues that are unresolved and could severely limit the commercial potential of this product. The regulatory environment for inhaled nicotine products is evolving and the resolution of any necessary regulatory approvals is uncertain at this time. Smokers\u2019 acceptance of this product for use in smoking cessation or as a cigarette replacement is unknown. Competition for our product exists from currently marketed smoking cessation products, such as nicotine replacement products, as well as from electronic cigarettes. In order to commercialize this product, substantial amounts of capital will be required to establish and operate a high volume manufacturing facility. We have no experience with developing, manufacturing or selling commercial products.\nWe depend upon our proprietary technologies, and we may not be able to protect our potential competitive proprietary advantage.\nAny of our pending or future patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents and any patents issued may be subjected to further proceedings limiting their scope and may in any event not contain claims broad enough to provide meaningful protection. Any patents that are issued to us or our present and future collaborators may not provide significant proprietary protection or competitive advantage, and may be circumvented or invalidated. In addition, unpatented proprietary rights, including trade secrets and know-how, can be difficult to protect and may lose their value if they are independently developed by a third party or if their secrecy is lost. Further, because development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products can be subject to substantial delays, patents may expire and provide only a short period of protection, if any, following commercialization of products.\nWe may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, and any litigation could force us to stop developing or selling potential products and could be costly, divert management attention and harm our business.\nWe must be able to develop products without infringing the proprietary rights of other parties. Because the markets in which we operate involve established competitors with significant patent portfolios, including patents relating to compositions of matter, methods of use and methods of drug delivery, it could be difficult for us to use our technologies or develop products without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We may not be able to design around the patented technologies or inventions of others and we may not be able to obtain licenses to use patented technologies on acceptable terms, or at all. If we cannot operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, we will not earn product revenues.\nIf we are required to defend ourselves in a lawsuit, we could incur substantial costs and the lawsuit could divert management\u2019s attention, regardless of the lawsuit\u2019s merit or outcome. These legal actions could seek damages and seek to enjoin testing, manufacturing and marketing of the accused product or process. In addition to potential liability for significant damages, we could be required to obtain a license to continue to manufacture or market the accused product or process and any license required under any such patent may not be made available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nPeriodically, we review publicly available information regarding the development efforts of others in order to determine whether these efforts may violate our proprietary rights. We may determine that litigation is necessary to enforce our proprietary rights against others. Such litigation could result in substantial expense, regardless of its outcome, and may not be resolved in our favor.\nFurthermore, patents already issued to us or our pending patent applications may become subject to dispute, and any disputes could be resolved against us. In addition, because patent applications in the United States are currently maintained in secrecy for a period of time prior to issuance, patent applications in certain other countries generally are not published until more than 18 months after they are first filed, and publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first creator of inventions covered by our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications on such inventions.\nWe are in a highly competitive market, and our competitors have developed or may develop alternative therapies for our target indications, which would limit the revenue potential of any product we may develop.\nWe compete with pharmaceutical, biotechnology and drug delivery companies, hospitals, research organizations, individual scientists and nonprofit organizations engaged in the development of drugs and therapies for the disease indications we are targeting. Our competitors may succeed, and many already have succeeded, in developing competing technologies for the same disease indications, obtaining FDA approval for products or gaining acceptance for the same markets that we are targeting. If we are not \u201cfirst to market,\u201d it may be more difficult for us and our present and future collaborators to enter markets as second or subsequent competitors and become commercially successful.\nWe are aware of a number of companies that are developing or have developed therapies to address indications we are targeting, including major pharmaceutical companies such as Bayer. We are aware that Bayer is currently conducting two Phase 3 clinical trials of their inhaled ciprofloxacin dry powder formulation in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis patients in several countries. Bayer and many other potential competitors have greater research and development, manufacturing, marketing, sales, distribution, financial and managerial resources and experience than we have and many of these companies may have products and product candidates that are on the market or in a more advanced stage of development than our product candidates. Our ability to earn product revenues and our market share would be substantially harmed if any existing or potential competitors brought a product to market before we or our present and future collaborators were able to, or if a competitor introduced at any time a product superior to or more cost-effective than ours.\nIf we do not continue to attract and retain key employees, our product development efforts will be delayed and impaired.\nWe depend on a small number of key management and technical personnel. Our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified management, clinical, regulatory and development personnel. There is a shortage of skilled personnel in our industry, we face competition in our recruiting activities, and we may not be able to attract or retain qualified personnel. Losing any of our key employees, particularly our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Igor Gonda, and Dr. Juergen Froehlich, our Chief Medical Officer, could impair our product development efforts and otherwise harm our business. Any of our employees may terminate their employment with us at will.\nIf we market our products in other countries, we will be subject to different laws and regulations and we may not be able to adapt to those laws and regulations, which could increase our costs while reducing our revenues.\nIf we market any approved products in foreign countries, we will be subject to different laws and regulations, particularly with respect to intellectual property rights and regulatory approval. To maintain a proprietary market position in foreign countries, we may seek to protect some of our proprietary inventions through foreign counterpart patent applications. Statutory differences in patentable subject matter may limit the protection we can obtain on some of our inventions outside of the United States. The diversity of patent laws may make our expenses associated with the development and maintenance of intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions more expensive than we anticipate. We probably will not obtain the same patent protection in every market in which we may otherwise be able to potentially generate revenues. In addition, in order to market our products in foreign jurisdictions, we and our present and future collaborators must obtain required regulatory approvals from foreign regulatory agencies and comply with extensive regulations regarding safety and quality. We may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals in such jurisdictions and we may have to incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining any foreign regulatory approvals. If approvals to market our products are delayed, if we fail to receive these approvals, or if we lose previously received approvals, our business would be impaired as we could not earn revenues from sales in those countries.\nWe may be exposed to product liability claims, which would hurt our reputation, market position and operating results.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates in humans and will face an even greater risk upon commercialization of any products. These claims may be made directly by consumers or by pharmaceutical companies or others selling such products. We may be held liable if any product we develop causes injury or is found otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing or sale. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims would likely result in negative publicity, decreased demand for any products that we may develop, injury to our reputation and suspension or withdrawal of clinical trials. Any such claim will be very costly to defend and also may result in substantial monetary awards to clinical trial participants or customers, loss of revenues and the inability to commercialize products that we develop. Although we currently have clinical trials and product liability insurance, we may not be able to maintain such insurance or obtain additional insurance on acceptable terms, in amounts sufficient to protect our business, or at all. A successful claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur current facility lease is scheduled to expire and we may not be able to secure a new facility lease on terms commercially favorable for us.\nWe lease approximately 72,000 square feet of office and laboratory space in an office building at 3929 Point Eden Way, California, which is scheduled to expire in July 2016. While our current facility requirement is for significantly less than 72,000 square feet, due to the competitive commercial real estate market in Silicon Valley,\nwe may not be able to secure a new facility lease on terms commercially favorable for us. In addition, the relocation of our current corporate headquarters could be disruptive to our business operations, result in increased expenses, hinder our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, and may also cause employee turnover if the commute time for our headquartered employees is significantly increased.\nIf we cannot arrange for adequate third-party reimbursement for our products, our revenues will suffer.\nIn both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our potential products will depend in substantial part on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third-party payors such as government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors often challenge the price and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. Significant uncertainty exists as to the adequate reimbursement status of newly approved health care products. Any products we are able to successfully develop may not be reimbursable by third-party payors. In addition, our products may not be considered cost-effective and adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize a profit. Legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change before our products are approved for marketing and any such changes could further limit reimbursement. If any products we develop do not receive adequate reimbursement, our revenues will be severely limited.\nOur use of hazardous materials could subject us to liabilities, fines and sanctions.\nOur laboratory and clinical testing sometimes involves the use of hazardous and toxic materials. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing how we use, manufacture, handle, store and dispose of these materials. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply in all material respects with all federal, state and local regulations and standards, there is always the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and such liability could exceed our financial resources. Compliance with environmental and other laws may be expensive and current or future regulations may impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nIf we are unable to effectively implement or maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial results and our stock price could be adversely affected.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year, and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for that fiscal year. Our ability to comply with the annual internal control report requirements will depend on the effectiveness of our financial reporting and data systems and controls across our company. We expect these systems and controls to involve significant expenditures and to become increasingly complex as our business grows. To effectively manage this complexity, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the implementation or operation of these controls, could harm our operating results and cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could adversely affect our business and reduce our stock price.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price is likely to remain volatile.\nThe market prices for securities of many companies in the drug delivery and pharmaceutical industries, including ours, have historically been highly volatile, and the market from time to time has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. The market prices for our common stock may also be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe limited trading volume for shares of our common stock and the fact that a large percentage of our outstanding shares are held by a small number of shareholder;\n\u2022\nannouncements of clinical trial results, technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ninvestor perception of us;\n\u2022\nsales of our stock by certain large institutional shareholders;\n\u2022\nresearch analyst recommendations and our ability to meet or exceed quarterly performance expectations of analysts or investors;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nfailure to maintain or establish collaborative relationships;\n\u2022\npublicity regarding actual or potential developments relating to products under development by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights;\n\u2022\ndelays in the development or approval of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in both the United States and foreign countries;\n\u2022\nconcern of the public or the medical community as to the safety or efficacy of our products, or products deemed to have similar safety risk factors or other similar characteristics to our products;\n\u2022\nfuture sales or expected sales of substantial amounts of common stock by shareholders;\n\u2022\nour ability to raise capital; and\n\u2022\neconomic and other external factors.\nIn the past, class action securities litigation has often been instituted against companies promptly following volatility in the market price of their securities. Any such litigation instigated against us would, regardless of its merit, result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nIn addition, although our shares are currently listed by NASDAQ, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining a NASDAQ listing continuously or that we will be able to meet NASDAQ listing standards going forward. The failure to maintain the NASDAQ listing for our common stock could adversely affect the price for , and liquidity of, our common stock.\nWe have implemented certain anti-takeover provisions, which may make an acquisition less likely or might result in costly litigation or proxy battles.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation and the California Corporations Code could discourage a party from acquiring, or make it more difficult for a party to acquire, control of our company without approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions could also limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay\nin the future for shares of our common stock. Certain provisions allow our Board of Directors to authorize the issuance, without shareholder approval, of preferred stock with rights superior to those of the common stock. We are also subject to the provisions of Section 1203 of the California Corporations Code, which requires us to provide a fairness opinion to our shareholders in connection with their consideration of any proposed \u201cinterested party\u201d reorganization transaction.\nWe have adopted a shareholder rights plan, commonly known as a \u201cpoison pill.\u201d We have also adopted an executive officer severance plan and entered into change of control agreements with our executive officers, both of which may provide for the payment of benefits to our officers and other key employees in connection with an acquisition. The provisions of our articles of incorporation, our poison pill, our severance plan and our change of control agreements, and provisions of the California Corporations Code may discourage, delay or prevent another party from acquiring us or reduce the price that a buyer is willing to pay for our common stock.\nOne or more of our shareholders may choose to pursue a lawsuit or engage in a proxy battle with management to limit our use of one or more of these anti-takeover protections. Any such lawsuit or proxy battle would, regardless of its merit or outcome, result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. Therefore, our shareholders may not receive any funds absent a sale of their shares. We cannot assure shareholders of a positive return on their investment if they sell their shares, nor can we assure that shareholders will not lose the entire amount of their investment.\nConflicts of interest and other disputes may arise between Grifols and us that may be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us and our other shareholders.\nIn August 2013, we entered into several agreements with Grifols as part of the completion of a private sale of shares of common stock to Grifols, including in particular the License Agreement, the Governance Agreement, and a registration rights agreement with respect to shares of common stock owned by Grifols. As a result of the various obligations under these agreements, in addition to Grifol\u2019s ownership of a significant amount of our outstanding common stock, conflicts of interest may arise between us and Grifols from time to time. Disagreements regarding the rights and obligation of Grifols under these agreements could create conflicts of interest for certain of our directors who have been appointed by Grifols. Any such disagreements could also lead to actual disputes or legal proceedings that may be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us and our other shareholders. In addition, Grifols has a number of consent rights under the Governance Agreement, including the right to consent to any termination of our Chief Executive Officer or our appointment of a successor Chief Executive Officer and certain preemptive rights to participate in any future issuances of common stock (or common stock equivalents) by us or to acquire shares in the open market to maintain ownership thresholds specified in the Governance Agreement. Grifols may exercise any of these rights, or any of its other rights contained in its agreements with us, in a manner which is not necessarily in the best interest of us or our other shareholders. The result of any of these conflicts could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or the price of our common stock.\nA small number of shareholders own a large percentage of our common stock and can influence the outcome of matters submitted to our shareholders for approval.\nA small number of our shareholders own a large percentage of our common stock and can, therefore, influence the outcome of matters submitted to our shareholders for approval. Based on information known to us as of February 16, 2016, our two largest shareholders, collectively, control in excess of a majority of our\noutstanding common stock. As a result, these shareholders have the ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including certain proposed amendments to our amended and restated articles of incorporation (for example, amendments to increase the number of our authorized shares) and any other material transactions we may undertake in the future, such a financing transaction or a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. These shareholders may support proposals and actions with which you may disagree. The concentration of ownership could delay or prevent a change in control of our company or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of our company, which in turn could reduce the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 83622, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "ARDMQ"}
