Risk Factors\nYou should consider carefully the risks described below in addition to the financial and other information contained in this Annual Report, including the matters addressed under the caption \u201cCautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d If any events described by the following risks actually occur, they could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. This could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business and our Industry\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or other similar outbreaks of contagious diseases.\nOutbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments affecting us and/or the third parties on which we rely, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and is continuing to impact, many aspects of society, including the operation of the healthcare system and other business and economic activity worldwide. Almost all U.S. states, many local jurisdictions and countries across the world have, at various times throughout the pandemic, issued \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders, quarantines, and restrictions and recommendations for their residents to control the spread of COVID-19, resulting in widespread closures of businesses, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, work-from-home policies and travel restrictions, among other effects.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, commercial sales of the medicines from which we derive revenue-consisting primarily of injectable medications administered by healthcare professionals-have been, and we expect will continue to be, adversely impacted as a result of developments that have transpired, and may continue to transpire, related to this pandemic, including travel restrictions and social distancing measures, many of which have contributed to limited access to healthcare providers and locations where injectable medications may be administered. Further, this pandemic and measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on global economic conditions, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition, including the demand for, and ability of patients to access, our and our licensees\u2019 medicines, or our ability to obtain financing, if needed, on favorable terms or at all.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has, to varying degrees, disrupted our business operations and the business operations of the third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, packagers, distributors, contract research organizations, customers, clinical site investigators, community advocacy partners, and others, and may continue to do so for so long as the pandemic and its impacts persist. For example, the third-party sites and investigators involved in our clinical trials have experienced, and may continue to experience, interruptions which have impacted, and may continue to impact, the conduct of our clinical trials and our ability to complete them in a timely manner or at all. If our clinical programs are significantly delayed as a result of such impacts, there could be adverse effects on our expected timelines for regulatory review and potential approval of our product candidates.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted, and may continue to impact, the regulatory agencies with which we interact in the development, manufacture, regulatory review and commercialization of our medicines. For example, travel restrictions and social distancing measures have impacted the manner in which the FDA, the HPRA and other regulatory agencies conduct their pre- or post-approval inspections of manufacturing facilities, relying more heavily on remote record reviews than in-person interactions. If such regulatory agencies do not find the results of such remote reviews to be sufficient for their regulatory purposes, our manufacturing activities or expected timelines for regulatory review and approval of our product candidates may be delayed, which could have an adverse effect on our business and the market price for our ordinary shares. For example, we received a CRL from the FDA, which included a request for information, regarding the NDA for LYBALVI following the FDA\u2019s remote review of records relating to the manufacture of LYBALVI at our Wilmington, Ohio facility. We subsequently resubmitted our NDA, and the FDA assigned the application a PDUFA target action date of June 1, 2021. Following our resubmission, the FDA issued a new request for records to supplement information that we previously provided. There is no guarantee that the FDA\u2019s remote review of our resubmission and additional records will be sufficient to meet the FDA\u2019s requirements for approval of LYBALVI without the conduct of a pre-approval inspection.\nDespite the spread of COVID-19 across the U.S., we have begun to observe, and expect to continue to observe, a gradual normalization in patient and healthcare provider practices, as providers and patients have adapted their behaviors and procedures to the evolving circumstances and as COVID-19 vaccines continue to be administered. However, the degree to which the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on the ultimate severity and duration of this pandemic and the manner in which it continues to evolve, and future developments in response thereto, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted as of the date of this Annual Report and which may include, among other things, governmental, business or other actions that have been, or will be, taken in response to this pandemic, including continued restrictions on travel and mobility, business closures and imposition of social distancing measures; impacts of the pandemic on our employees, the vendors or distribution channels in our supply chain and on our ability to continue to manufacture and supply our products; impacts of the pandemic on the conduct of our clinical trials, including with respect to enrollment rates, availability of investigators and clinical\ntrial sites, and monitoring of data; impacts of the pandemic on healthcare systems that serve people living with opioid dependence, alcohol dependence and schizophrenia; impacts of the pandemic on the regulatory agencies with which we interact in the development, review, approval and commercialization of our medicines; impacts of the pandemic on reimbursement for our products, including our Medicaid rebate liability, and for services related to the use of our products; and impacts of the pandemic on the U.S., Irish and/or global economies more broadly. For example, if the U.S. Consumer Price Index-Urban (CPI-U) becomes negative, this would increase our Medicaid rebate liability. For a discussion of the Medicaid rebate liability, please see the \u201cPricing and Reimbursement\u201d section in \u201cItem 1 - Business\u201d in this Annual Report.\nWe receive substantial revenue from our key proprietary products and our success depends on our ability to maintain or increase sales of such products.\nSales of our proprietary products comprise an increasingly significant portion of our revenues. We developed and exclusively manufacture VIVITROL for the treatment of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence, ARISTADA for the treatment of schizophrenia, and ARISTADA INITIO for initiation onto ARISTADA for the treatment of schizophrenia, and we exclusively commercialize these products in the U.S. Our success depends in large part on our ability to continue to successfully manufacture and increase sales of such products in the complex markets into which they are sold. Any significant negative developments relating to these products could have a material adverse effect on our revenues from these products and, in turn, on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and the market price of our ordinary shares.\nWe rely heavily on our licensees in the commercialization and continued development of products from which we receive revenue; and if our licensees are not effective, our revenues could be materially adversely affected.\nOur arrangements with licensees are critical to bringing to market and/or successfully commercializing products using our proprietary technologies and from which we receive manufacturing and/or royalty revenue. We rely on these licensees in various respects, including commercializing such products, conducting development activities with respect to new formulations or new indications for such products, and/or managing the regulatory approval process for such products.\nWe earn significant royalty and/or manufacturing revenue from sales by our licensees of our licensed products and third-party products incorporating our proprietary technologies. The revenues we receive from such products depend primarily upon the success of our licensees in commercializing such products. For example, we receive substantial revenue from Janssen\u2019s sales of RISPERDAL CONSTA, INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION and INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA and upon sales of FAMPYRA by Biogen. We have no involvement in the commercialization efforts for these and other products sold by third parties from which we receive revenue, and cannot control the extent or effectiveness of such commercialization efforts.\nDisputes may also arise between us and a licensee involving the ownership of technology developed under a license, the terms and amounts of royalty payments to be paid under a license, or other issues arising out of any licenses or other collaborative agreements. Such disputes may delay related development programs, impact commercialization or manufacturing activities for the related products or result in expensive arbitration or litigation, which may not be resolved in our favor and may adversely impact our financial condition. Further, certain of our license agreements may be terminated without cause, or assigned in connection with a change in control, and we cannot guarantee that any of these relationships will continue or that our licensees will be able or willing to continue to perform their obligations under such agreements. Any significant negative developments relating to our relationships with our licensees or our collaborative arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nFor these and other reasons that may be outside of our control, our revenues from products sold by our licensees may fall below our expectations, the expectations of our licensees or those of our shareholders, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the market price of our ordinary shares.\nWe face competition in the biopharmaceutical industry.\nWe face intense competition in the development, manufacture, marketing and commercialization of our products from many and varied sources, such as research institutions and other biopharmaceutical companies, including companies with similar technologies or medicines, and manufacturers of generic drugs. Some of these competitors are also our licensees, who control the commercialization of products from which we receive manufacturing and/or royalty revenues. For example, our proprietary product ARISTADA competes directly with RISPERDAL CONSTA, INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION and INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA, products from which we receive significant manufacturing and/or royalty revenues.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intensive research, development and commercialization efforts and rapid and significant technological change. In many cases, there are already products on the market that may be in direct competition with our commercial products or products in development. In addition, there are many companies developing generic versions of our products, or products with similar technologies to ours or for use in similar indications with whom we and our licensees compete, many of whom are larger and have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do. Other smaller or earlier stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through focused development programs and collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Some of the products being developed by our competitors are being designed to work differently than\nour products and may turn out to be safer or more effective than our products, which may render our products or technology platforms obsolete or noncompetitive. For a detailed discussion of the competition that we face with respect to our current marketed products, technology platforms and product indications, please see the section entitled \u201cCompetition\u201d in \u201cItem 1 - Business\u201d in this Annual Report. If we are unable to compete successfully in this highly competitive biopharmaceutical industry, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThere are many factors that could cause our revenues to decrease or grow at a slower than expected rate.\nWe cannot be assured that our products will be, or will continue to be, accepted in the U.S. or markets outside the U.S. or that we will be able to maintain or increase sales of our products. Factors that may cause revenues from our products to grow at a slower than expected rate, decrease or cease all together, include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe perception of physicians and other members of the healthcare community as to our products\u2019 safety and efficacy relative to that of competing products and the willingness or ability of physicians and other members of the healthcare community to prescribe, dispense and/or administer, and patients to use, our products, including those that may be scheduled by the DEA;\n\u2022\nunfavorable publicity concerning us, our licensees, our products, similar classes of drugs or the industry generally;\n\u2022\nthe cost-effectiveness of our products and reimbursement policies of government and third-party payers that may impact use of our products;\n\u2022\nthe cost and availability of raw materials necessary for the manufacture of our products;\n\u2022\nthe successful manufacture of our products on a timely and cost-effective basis;\n\u2022\nthe size of the markets for our products, and patient and physician satisfaction with our products;\n\u2022\nsignificant changes in the competitive landscape for our products, including any approval of generic versions of our products or other branded products that may compete with our products;\n\u2022\nadverse event information relating to our products or to similar classes of drugs;\n\u2022\nchanges to the product labels of our products, or of products within the same drug classes, to add significant warnings or restrictions on use;\n\u2022\nour continued ability to engage third parties to package and/or distribute our products on acceptable terms;\n\u2022\nthe unfavorable outcome of investigations, litigation or other legal proceedings, including government requests for information regarding VIVITROL, securities litigation relating to ALKS 5461, IP litigation, including so-called \u201cParagraph IV\u201d litigation relating to VIVITROL, INVEGA SUSTENNA and INVEGA TRINZA, and litigation or other proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\u2019s (the \u201cUSPTO\u201d) Patent Trial and Appeal Board (the \u201cPTAB\u201d) or its equivalent in other jurisdictions outside of the U.S., including opposition proceedings in the EU relating to RISPERDAL CONSTA and any other litigation related to any of our products;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments and actions related to the manufacture, commercialization or continued use of our products, including FDA actions such as the issuance of a REMS or warning letter, or conduct of an audit by the FDA or another regulatory authority in which a manufacturing or quality deficiency is identified;\n\u2022\nthe extent and effectiveness of the sales, marketing and distribution support for our products, including our licensees\u2019 decisions as to the timing and volume of product orders and shipments, the timing of product launches, and product pricing and discounting;\n\u2022\ndisputes with our licensees relating to the marketing and sale of products from which we receive manufacturing and/or royalty revenue and the amounts to be paid with respect to such products;\n\u2022\nexchange rate valuations and fluctuations;\n\u2022\nU.S. and global political changes and/or instability, including the recent change in the U.S. presidential administration and the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d), and any related changes in applicable laws and regulations, that may impact resources and markets for our products outside of the U.S.;\n\u2022\nthe impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the manufacture and commercialization of our products; and\n\u2022\nany other material adverse developments with respect to the commercialization of our products.\nRevenues generated by sales of our products depend on the availability from third-party payers of reimbursement for our products and the extent of cost-sharing arrangements for patients (e.g., patient co-payment, co-insurance, deductible obligations), cost-control measures imposed, reductions in payment rate or reimbursement or increases in our financial obligation to payers could result in decreased sales of our products and decreased revenues.\nIn both U.S. and non-U.S. markets, sales of our products depend, in part, on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers such as state and federal governments, including Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S. and similar programs in other countries, managed care providers and private insurance plans. Deterioration in the timeliness, certainty and amount of reimbursement for our products, the existence of barriers to coverage of our products (such as prior authorization, criteria for use or other requirements), increases in our financial obligation to payers, including government payers, limitations by healthcare providers on how much, or under what circumstances, they will prescribe or administer our products or unwillingness by patients to pay any required co-payments, or deductible amounts, could reduce the use of, and revenues generated from, our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. In addition, when a new product is approved, the availability of government and private reimbursement for that product and coverage restrictions that may be imposed for such product, are uncertain, as is the amount for which that product will be reimbursed. We cannot predict the availability or amount of reimbursement or other access barriers for our products.\nIn the U.S., federal and state legislatures, health agencies and third-party payers continue to focus on containing the cost of healthcare, including by comparing the effectiveness, benefits and costs of similar treatments. Any adverse findings for our products from such comparisons may reduce the extent of reimbursement for our products. Economic pressure on state budgets may result in states increasingly seeking to achieve budget savings through mechanisms that limit coverage or payment for drugs, including but not limited to price control initiatives, discounts and other pricing-related actions. Over the past several years, a number of states have enacted drug pricing transparency laws that require companies to report on drug price increases and justify how drug prices were set. We expect additional state drug pricing initiatives to be proposed and enacted in 2021 and beyond. In addition, state Medicaid programs are increasingly requesting manufacturers to pay supplemental rebates and requiring prior authorization by the state program for use of any drug. Managed care organizations continue to seek price discounts and, in some cases, to impose restrictions on the coverage of particular drugs. Government efforts to reduce Medicaid expenses may lead to increased use of managed care organizations by Medicaid programs. This may result in managed care organizations influencing prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population and a corresponding constraint on prices and reimbursement for our products.\nIn 2021, we may face uncertainties as a result of continued federal and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the PPACA, the outcome of existing litigation related to PPACA, and potential reforms and changes to government negotiation or regulation of drug pricing. PPACA significantly expanded coverage of mental health and substance use disorders and provided federal parity protections to such coverage benefits. There is no assurance that such efforts and proposed legislation will not adversely affect our business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform and drug pricing will affect our business.\nIn addition, the outcome or settlement of litigation could impact the practices of healthcare providers and patients, and the policies and practices of third-party payers, including Medicare, Medicaid, managed care providers and private insurance plans, in a manner detrimental to our products, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition. For example, one or more defendants in the opioid multi-district litigation has offered large volumes of generic buprenorphine free of charge to state plaintiffs as settlement compensation, which, if agreed to and approved, could negatively impact state reimbursement policies, healthcare provider practices, and patient access to alternative FDA-approved medications to generic buprenorphine, which includes VIVITROL, for the treatment of opioid dependence.\nThe government-sponsored healthcare systems in Europe and many other countries are the primary payers for healthcare expenditures, including payment for drugs and biologics. We expect that countries may take actions to reduce expenditure on drugs and biologics, including mandatory price reductions, patient access restrictions, suspensions of price increases, increased mandatory discounts or rebates, preference for generic products, reduction in the amount of reimbursement and greater importation of drugs from lower-cost countries. These cost-control measures likely would reduce our revenues. In addition, certain countries set prices by reference to the prices in other countries where our products are marketed. Thus, the inability to secure adequate prices in a particular country may not only limit the marketing of products within that country, but may also adversely affect the ability to obtain acceptable prices in other markets.\nClinical trials for our products are expensive, may take several years to complete, and their outcomes are uncertain.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any products, we or our licensees must demonstrate, through preclinical testing and clinical trials, that our products are safe and effective for use in humans. Designing, conducting and completing a clinical development program is often a lengthy, time-consuming and expensive process. We have incurred, and we will continue to incur, substantial expense for preclinical testing and clinical trials and other activities related to our clinical development programs.\nOur preclinical and clinical development efforts may take several years or more, varying substantially with the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of the product and the clinical study designs and methodologies employed, and may not be successfully completed in a timely manner or at all. Timelines for the initiation, conduct and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nissues with the opening, operation or inspection of a new or ongoing clinical trial site;\n\u2022\ndelays or failures of third-party CROs and other third-party service providers and clinical investigators to manage and conduct the trials, perform oversight of the trials, including data audit and verification procedures, or to meet expected deadlines;\n\u2022\nan inability to recruit clinical trial participants at the expected rate or at all, or to adequately follow participants following treatment;\n\u2022\nunforeseen safety or tolerability issues;\n\u2022\nan inability to manufacture or obtain sufficient quantities of materials used for clinical trials;\n\u2022\nunforeseen governmental or regulatory issues or concerns, including those of the FDA, DEA and other regulatory agencies; and\n\u2022\nglobal instability, including instability relating to political events or a global pandemic or other contagious disease, such as COVID-19, in or near the countries in which we conduct our clinical trials.\nIn addition, we are currently conducting and enrolling patients in clinical studies in a number of countries where our experience is more limited. In these instances, we must depend on third parties, including independent clinical investigators, CROs and other third-party service providers, to successfully conduct our clinical trials and to audit, verify and accurately report results from such trials. Though we do not have much control over many aspects of such third-party activities, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Third parties may not complete planned activities on schedule or conduct our trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols.\nThe outcome of our clinical trials is uncertain. The results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials often have not predicted results of later clinical trials. A number of products have shown promising results in early clinical trials but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data in later clinical trials to obtain necessary regulatory approvals.\nIf a product fails to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials, or if third parties fail to conduct clinical trials in accordance with their obligations, the development, approval and commercialization of our products may be delayed or prevented, and such events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nPreliminary, topline or interim data from our clinical trials that we may announce, publish or report from time to time may change as more patient data become available or based on subsequent audit and verification procedures, and may not be indicative of final data from such trials.\nFrom time to time, we may announce, publish or report preliminary, topline or interim data from our clinical trials, including those we are conducting in oncology. Such data are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patients continue progressing through the study (for example, a patient may progress from a complete or partial response to progressive disease), as patient enrollment continues and/or as more patient data become available, and such data may not be indicative of final data from such trials. Such data also remain subject to audit confirmation and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary, topline or interim data we previously disclose. As a result, all preliminary, topline and interim data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. Material adverse differences between preliminary, topline or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe FDA or other regulatory agencies may not approve our products or may delay approval.\nWe must obtain government approvals before marketing or selling our products. The U.S. FDA and DEA (to the extent a product is a controlled substance), and comparable regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions, impose substantial and rigorous requirements for the development, manufacture and commercialization of medicines, the satisfaction of which can take a significant number of years and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product.\nIn addition, regulation is not static, and regulatory agencies, including the FDA, evolve in their staff, interpretations and practices and may impose more stringent requirements than currently in effect, which may adversely affect our plans for product development, manufacture and/or commercialization. The approval procedure and the time required to obtain approval also varies among countries. Regulatory agencies may have varying interpretations of the same data, and approval by one regulatory agency does\nnot ensure approval by regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions. In addition, the FDA or regulatory agencies outside the U.S. may choose not to communicate with or update us during clinical testing and regulatory review periods and the ultimate decision by the FDA or other regulatory agencies regarding drug approval may not be consistent with prior communications.\nThe product approval process can last many years, be very costly and still be unsuccessful. Regulatory approval by the FDA or non-U.S. regulatory agencies can be delayed, limited or not granted at all for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\na product may not demonstrate safety and efficacy for each target indication in accordance with the FDA\u2019s or other regulatory agencies\u2019 standards;\n\u2022\ndata from preclinical testing and clinical trials may be interpreted by the FDA or other regulatory agencies in different ways than we or our licensees interpret it;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or other regulatory agencies may not agree with our or our licensees\u2019 regulatory approval strategies, plans for accelerated development timelines, components of our or our licensees\u2019 filings such as clinical trial designs, conduct and methodologies, or the sufficiency of our or our licensees\u2019 submitted data to meet their requirements for product approval;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or other regulatory agencies might not approve our or our licensees\u2019 manufacturing processes or facilities, or those of the CROs and contract manufacturing organizations who conduct research or manufacturing work on our or our licensees\u2019 behalf;\n\u2022\nany failure by our clinical investigational sites and the records kept at such sites, including any clinical trial data, to be in compliance with the FDA\u2019s GCP, or EU legislation governing GCP, or to pass FDA, EMA or EU member state inspections of clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or other regulatory agencies may change their requirements for approval or post-approval marketing; and\n\u2022\nadverse medical events during the trials could lead to requirements that trials be repeated or extended, or that a program be terminated or placed on clinical hold, even if other studies or trials relating to the program are successful.\nIn addition, disruptions at the FDA and other regulatory agencies that are unrelated to our company or our products, including those relating to COVID-19 or other political or economic conditions, could cause delays to the regulatory approval process for our products. As of June 23, 2020, the FDA noted it is continuing to ensure timely review of applications for medical products during the COVID-19 pandemic in line with its user fee performance goals; however, FDA may not be able to continue its current pace and approval timelines could be extended, including in instances when a pre-approval inspection or an inspection of clinical trial sites is required and due to COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions, the FDA may be unable to complete such required inspections during the review period. In addition, if a prolonged U.S. government shutdown occurs as a result of political or economic conditions or if the COVID-19 pandemic increases in severity or impact, the FDA\u2019s ability to timely review and process our regulatory submissions could be significantly impacted.\nFor example, in December 2020, we resubmitted our NDA for LYBALVI for the treatment of adults with schizophrenia and adults with bipolar I disorder, following receipt from the FDA in November 2020 of a CRL, which included an information request, relating to the manufacture of LYBALVI at our manufacturing facility in Wilmington, Ohio. The FDA accepted the NDA resubmission and assigned the application a PDUFA target action date of June 1, 2021 and subsequently issued a new request for records under Section 704(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to supplement records that we previously provided. The FDA review process for this NDA involves uncertainties and risks, particularly in the current COVID-19 environment, including whether the FDA\u2019s remote review of our resubmission and additional records will be sufficient to meet the FDA\u2019s requirements for approval of LYBALVI without the conduct of a pre-approval inspection, whether the FDA will have additional requests for records or information in order to complete its review of the NDA, or whether the NDA will be approved in a timely manner, or at all.\nAny failure to obtain, or delay in obtaining, regulatory approval for our products will prevent or delay their commercialization and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. In addition, any failure to obtain, or delay in obtaining, approval for our products could have a material impact on our shareholders\u2019 confidence in the strength of our development capabilities and/or our ability to generate significant revenue from our development program and could result in a significant decline in our share price.\nThe FDA or other regulatory agencies may impose limitations or post-approval requirements on any product approval.\nEven if regulatory approval to market a product is granted by the FDA or other regulatory agencies, the approved label may not be consistent with our initial expectations or commercial plans, including limitations on the clinical data that may be included or the indicated uses for which, or the manner in which, the product may be marketed, or the approval may impose additional post-approval requirements, such as a REMS, with which we would need to comply in order to maintain the approval of such product. Our business could be seriously harmed if we do not complete these post-approval requirements and, as a result, the FDA or other regulatory agencies require us to change the label for our products, or if such post-approval requirements significantly restrict the marketing, sale\nor use of our products.\nFurther, if a product for which we obtain regulatory approval is a controlled substance, it will not become commercially available until after the DEA provides its final schedule designation, which may take longer and may be more restrictive than we expect or may change after its initial designation. For example, LYBALVI, our product currently under review by the FDA, contains samidorphan, which is currently a scheduled substance. The DEA issued a proposed ruling to deschedule samidorphan in December 2020; however, even if LYBALVI is approved by the FDA, until the DEA issues a final ruling, we will not be able to commercialize LYBALVI as a non-controlled substance. In addition, a final designation that is more restrictive than we expect could adversely affect our ability to commercialize such product and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nIn addition, legislation and regulatory policies relating to post-approval requirements and restrictions on promotional activities for pharmaceutical products, or FDA or DEA regulations, guidance or interpretations with respect to such legislation or regulatory policy, may change, which may impact the development and commercialization of our products.\nWe are subject to risks related to the manufacture of our products.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products is a highly complex process in which a variety of difficulties may arise from time to time including, but not limited to, the supply and quality of API, drug product and other product components; failures relating to materials, manufacturing equipment or processes, vendor error, operator error, labor shortages or transportation, physical or electronic security breaches; natural disasters or global disruptions such as the current global pandemic; and many other factors. Problems with manufacturing processes, whether at our facilities or those of our licensees or other third parties which manufacture products or components of products on our behalf, could result in product defects, manufacturing failures or products not being manufactured to their applicable specifications, which could require us to delay shipment of products or recall products previously shipped, or could impair our ability to receive regulatory approval for a product, expand into new markets or supply products in existing markets. We may not be able to resolve any such issues in a timely manner, or at all.\nWe rely solely on our manufacturing facility in Wilmington, Ohio for the manufacture of RISPERDAL CONSTA, VIVITROL, ARISTADA, ARISTADA INITIO and certain of our other products in development, including LYBALVI. We rely solely on our manufacturing facility in Athlone, Ireland for the manufacture of many products, including AMPYRA, FAMPYRA and VUMERITY and other products using our NanoCrystal or OCR technologies. Due to regulatory and technical requirements, we have limited ability to shift production among our facilities or to outsource any part of our manufacturing to third parties. Any need to shift production among our facilities or transition our manufacturing processes to a third party could take a significant amount of time and money, may not be successful, and could cause significant delay in our ability to supply product.\nOur manufacturing facilities also require specialized personnel and are expensive to operate and maintain. Any delay in a regulatory approval or commercial launch, or recall or suspension of sales, of products manufactured in our facilities may cause operating losses as we continue to operate these facilities and retain the required specialized personnel. In addition, any interruption in manufacturing, whether resulting from issues with equipment, materials, personnel or manufacturing processes, or internal or external quality audits or reviews, could result in delays in meeting our contractual obligations and could damage our relationships with our licensees, including the loss of manufacturing and supply rights.\nWe are also dependent in certain cases on third parties who manufacture or distribute certain products from which we receive revenue. For example, in the cases of INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION and INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA, we do not have manufacturing rights or any control over the manufacturing, supply or distribution of the product. Supply or manufacturing issues related to such products could materially and adversely affect sales of such products, and in turn our revenue from such products.\nWe rely on third parties to provide services in connection with the manufacture and distribution of the products we manufacture.\nWe rely on third parties for the timely supply of specified raw materials, equipment, contract manufacturing, formulation and packaging services, storage and product distribution services, customer service activities and product returns processing that play a role in our manufacturing activities, and some of these materials and services for our products are currently only available from a single source or a limited number of qualified sources. Although we actively manage these third-party relationships to ensure continuity, quality and compliance with applicable regulations, events beyond our control could result in the complete or partial failure of these goods and services. Any such failure could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe manufacture of products and product components, including the procurement of bulk drug product and other materials used in the manufacture, packaging, storage and distribution of our products, requires successful coordination among us and multiple third-party providers. Lack of capacity available at such third-party providers or any other issues with the quality or operations of these third-party providers, could require us to delay shipment of saleable products, recall products previously shipped or could impair our ability to supply products at all.\nWe endeavor to qualify and register new vendors and to develop contingency plans so that production is not materially impacted by third-party issues. Nonetheless, any such issues could increase our costs, cause us to lose revenue or market share and damage our reputation and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nIn addition, we rely heavily on the three largest pharmaceutical wholesalers in the U.S. market, Cardinal Health Inc., AmerisourceBergen Corp. and McKesson Corp, in the distribution of the products that we market and sell. If we are unable to maintain our business relationships with these wholesalers on commercially acceptable terms, if the buying patterns of these wholesalers fluctuate due to seasonality or any other reason or if wholesaler buying decisions or other factors outside of our control change, such events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nIf we or our third-party providers fail to meet the stringent requirements of governmental regulation in the manufacture of our products, we could incur substantial remedial costs and a reduction in sales and/or revenues.\nWe and our third-party providers are generally required to comply with cGMP regulations and other applicable non-U.S. standards in the manufacture of our products. In addition, in the U.S., the DEA and state-level agencies heavily regulate the manufacturing, holding, processing, security, recordkeeping and distribution of substances, including controlled substances. Any of our products that are scheduled by the DEA as controlled substances make us subject to the DEA\u2019s regulations. We and our third-party providers are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA, the DEA and comparable U.S. state and non-U.S. agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm compliance with all applicable laws. Any changes to our suppliers or modifications of methods of manufacturing require amendments to our NDAs to the FDA or other regulatory agencies, and ultimate acceptance by such agencies of such amendments, prior to release of product to the applicable marketplace. Our inability or the inability of our third-party providers to demonstrate ongoing cGMP or other regulatory compliance could require us to withdraw or recall products and interrupt clinical and commercial supply of our products. Any delay, interruption or other issues that may arise in the manufacture, formulation, packaging or storage of our products as a result of a failure of our facilities or the facilities or operations of third-party providers to pass any regulatory agency inspection could significantly impair our ability to develop, obtain and maintain regulatory authority approval of, and commercialize or supply, products. This could increase our costs, cause us to lose revenue or market share and damage our reputation with our collaboration partners or in the market generally.\nIn March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was signed into law in the U.S., and served to increase the FDA\u2019s existing authority with respect to drug shortage measures. Under the CARES Act, for each facility where marketed products for certain serious diseases or conditions are manufactured, or where components of such products are manufactured, we are required to have a risk management plan in place that identifies and evaluates risks to the supply of such products or product components, which plans may be subject to review during any FDA inspection. Each of our facilities operates in accordance with a comprehensive quality management system, which includes risk assessment, preventive actions and regular review of inventory levels for each of the marketed products that we manufacture; however, there is no guarantee that the FDA will consider our risk management program to be sufficient upon inspection or that we will not experience shortages in the supply of marketed products that we manufacture, which could materially adversely impact the patients who rely on such marketed products and our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. The FDA and various regulatory agencies outside the U.S. have inspected and approved our commercial manufacturing facilities. We cannot guarantee that the FDA or any other regulatory agencies will approve any other facility we or our third-party providers may operate or, once approved, that any of these facilities will remain in compliance with cGMP and other regulations. Any third party we use to manufacture bulk drug product must be licensed by the FDA and, for controlled substances, the DEA. Failure by us or our third-party providers to gain or maintain regulatory compliance with the FDA or other regulatory agencies could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nAdverse financial market conditions may exacerbate certain risks inherent to our business, including risk of payment from licensees and reimbursement for our products.\nDue to volatility in the financial markets, there may be disruptions or delays in the performance of our third-party contractors, suppliers or licensees, or reductions in the availability or extent of reimbursement available to us. For example, we depend on our licensees for significant portions of our revenue. The contracts with our licensees pursuant to which we supply product, or under which we are eligible for certain development or sales milestones, or royalties, related to products that incorporate our proprietary technologies, may not be secured by collateral or other security. Accordingly, we bear the risk that our licensees may not be able to pay amounts due to us under such contracts.\nIn addition, as a result of adverse financial market conditions, organizations that reimburse for use of our products, such as government health administration authorities and private health insurers, may be unable to satisfy such obligations or may delay payment. In addition, U.S. federal and state health authorities may reduce reimbursements (including Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements in the U.S.) or payments, and private insurers may increase their scrutiny of claims. If such licensees or other third parties are unable to pay amounts owed to us or satisfy their commitments to us, or if there are reductions to such payments or commitments, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur business strategy may involve future transactions which may harm the market price of our ordinary shares or require us to seek additional funds, and such funding may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all and may cause dilution to our existing shareholders.\nIn order to achieve our business strategy, we regularly review potential transactions related to technologies, products or product rights, and businesses that are complementary to our business, including mergers, acquisitions, licensing agreements and co-promotion agreements, among others. We may choose to enter into one or more of these transactions at any time, which may cause substantial fluctuations in the market price of our ordinary shares. Moreover, depending upon the nature of any transaction, we may experience a charge to earnings, which could also materially adversely affect our results of operations and could harm the market price of our ordinary shares.\nIn order to finance such transactions, we may require additional funds, and we may seek such funds through various sources, including debt and equity offerings, corporate collaborations, bank borrowings, arrangements relating to assets, monetization of royalty streams or other financing methods or structures. The source, timing and availability of any financings will depend on market conditions, interest rates and other factors. If we issue additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, our shareholders will suffer dilution of their investment, and it may adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares. In addition, future investors or lenders may demand, and may be granted, rights superior to those of existing shareholders. If we issue additional debt securities, our existing debt service obligations will increase further. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash to meet these obligations and need to use existing cash or liquidate investments in order to fund our debt service obligations or to repay our debt, we may be forced to curtail our operations. We cannot be certain that additional financing will be available from any of these sources when needed or, if available, will be on acceptable terms. If we fail to obtain additional capital when we need it, we may not be able to execute our business strategy successfully and may have to give up rights to our product platforms, and/or products, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nOur future success largely depends upon our ability to attract and retain key personnel.\nOur ability to compete and succeed in the highly competitive biopharmaceutical industry and in the disease states in which we market and sell products depends largely upon the continued service of our management, scientific and commercial teams and our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled technical, scientific, manufacturing, management, regulatory, compliance and selling and marketing personnel. Each of our executive officers and all of our employees are employed \u201cat will,\u201d meaning we or each officer or employee may terminate the employment relationship at any time. The loss of key personnel or our inability to hire and retain personnel who have technical, scientific, manufacturing, management, regulatory, compliance or commercial backgrounds could materially adversely impact our business, including the achievement of our manufacturing, research and development, commercial and other business objectives.\nThe increasing use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges.\nSocial media is increasingly being used to communicate about our products and the diseases our medicines are designed to treat. Social media practices in the biopharmaceutical industry continue to evolve, as do the regulations relating to such use. This evolution creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business. For example, patients may use social media channels to comment on the effectiveness of a product or to report an alleged adverse event. When such disclosures occur, there is a risk that we fail to monitor and comply with applicable adverse event reporting obligations or we may not be able to defend the company or the public\u2019s legitimate interests in the face of the political and market pressures generated by social media due to restrictions on what we may say about our products. There is also a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking website. If any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face overly restrictive regulatory actions or incur other harm to our business.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nPatent and other IP protection for our products is key to our business and our competitive position but is uncertain.\nReceiving and maintaining patent and/or trademark protection for our products and technologies, including those that are subject to our licensing arrangements, maintaining our trade secrets, not infringing on the proprietary rights of others, and preventing others from infringing our proprietary rights are each key to our success and our competitive position.\nPatent protection provides rights of exclusivity for the term of the patent. We are able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. In this regard, we try to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the U.S. and elsewhere related to our proprietary product inventions and improvements that are important to our business and products. Our pending patent applications, together with those we may file in the future, or those we may license to or from third parties, may not result in patents being issued. Even if issued, such patents may not provide us with sufficient proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products or technology. The development of new technologies or products may take a number of years, and there can be no assurance that any patents which may be granted in respect of such technologies or products will\nnot have expired or be due to expire by the time such products are commercialized, or that such patents will successfully withstand any challenges during their respective terms.\nBecause the patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies involve complex legal and factual questions, enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. The ultimate degree of patent protection that will be afforded to products and processes, including ours, and those of our licensees, in the U.S. and in other important markets, remains uncertain and is dependent upon the scope of protection decided upon by the patent offices, courts and lawmakers in these countries. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. As our products achieve greater commercial sales, potential competitors are more likely to seek to challenge our patents. The laws of certain countries may not protect our IP rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., and any patents that we own or license from others may not provide any protection against competitors. In addition, in the case of certain of our licensed products or products incorporating our licensed technology, our licensees are responsible for prosecuting, maintaining, enforcing and defending the IP related to the product(s) from which we derive revenue. Their failure to secure, maintain, enforce and defend this IP could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nAlthough we make reasonable efforts to protect our IP rights and to ensure that our proprietary technology does not infringe the rights of third parties, we cannot ascertain the existence of all potentially conflicting IP claims. Therefore, there is a risk that third parties may make claims of infringement against our products or technologies. If patents exist or are issued that cover our products or technologies, we may not be able to manufacture, use, offer for sale, sell or import such products without first getting a license from the patent holder. The patent holder may not grant us a license on reasonable terms, or it may refuse to grant us a license at all. This could delay or prevent us from developing, manufacturing, selling or importing those of our products that would require the license. Claims of IP infringement may also require that we redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products. Even if we have an agreement that may serve to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations. If we cannot, or do not, license the infringed technology on reasonable terms or at all, or substitute similar technology from another source, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, know-how and inventions, which are not protected by patents, to maintain our competitive position. We try to protect this information by entering into confidentiality agreements with parties that have access to it, such as our licensees, licensors, contract manufacturers, potential business partners, employees and consultants. However, any of these parties may breach such agreements and may disclose our confidential information, or our competitors might learn of the information in some other way. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use IP owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. If any trade secret, know-how or other invention not protected by a patent were to be disclosed to, or independently developed by, a competitor, such event could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nUncertainty over IP in the biopharmaceutical industry has been the source of litigation, which is inherently costly and unpredictable, could significantly delay or prevent approval or negatively impact commercialization of our products, and could adversely affect our business.\nThere is considerable uncertainty within the biopharmaceutical industry about the validity, scope and enforceability of many issued patents in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world. We cannot currently determine the ultimate scope, validity and enforceability of patents which may be granted to third parties in the future or which patents might be asserted to be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of our products.\nStemming in part from this uncertainty, there has been, and we expect that there may continue to be, significant litigation and an increasing number of inter partes reviews (\u201cIPRs\u201d) and administrative proceedings in the pharmaceutical industry regarding patents and other IP rights. A patent holder might file an IPR, interference and/or infringement action against us, including in response to patent certifications required under the Hatch-Waxman Act, claiming that certain claims of one or more of our issued patents are invalid or that the manufacture, use, offer for sale, sale or import of our products infringed one or more of such party\u2019s patents. We may have to expend considerable time, effort and resources to defend such actions, and litigation may be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights.\nIn addition, we may need to enforce our IP rights against third parties who infringe our patents and other IP or challenge our patents, patent applications or trademark applications. Litigation and trial proceedings, such as so-called Paragraph IV litigation and IPRs, concerning patents and other intellectual property rights may be expensive, protracted with no certainty of success, and distracting to management. As a result, we may at times give up certain rights with respect to our IP in order to avoid or resolve timely and costly litigation or IPR proceedings. For example, in July 2019, in order to resolve an IPR instituted by Amneal with the PTAB, we granted Amneal a non-exclusive license under certain patents covering VIVITROL, including the latest to expire patent covering VIVITROL in the U.S., to market and sell a generic formulation of VIVITROL in the U.S. beginning sometime in 2028 or earlier under certain circumstances. Ultimately, the outcome of such litigation and proceedings, or any settlement arrangement with respect thereto, could adversely affect our business and the validity and scope of our patents or other proprietary rights or delay or prevent us from manufacturing and marketing our products.\nWe or our licensees may face claims against IP rights covering our products and competition from generic drug manufacturers.\nIn the U.S., generic manufacturers of innovator drug products may file ANDAs and, in connection with such filings, certify that their products do not infringe the innovator\u2019s patents and/or that the innovator\u2019s patents are invalid. This often results in litigation between the innovator and the ANDA applicant. This type of litigation is commonly known in the U.S. as \u201cParagraph IV\u201d litigation.\nFor example, Teva entities filed an ANDA seeking approval to engage in the commercial manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of VIVITROL and alleging that one of our Orange-Book patents related to VIVITROL is invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Teva\u2019s proposed product. In September 2020, we initiated a Paragraph IV lawsuit against Teva to dispute such claims. Janssen is similarly involved in Paragraph IV litigation with companies seeking approval to market generic versions of INVEGA SUSTENNA and INVEGA TRINZA, products from which we receive significant revenue.\nAlthough we intend to vigorously defend our IP rights, and we expect our licensees to do the same, there can be no assurance that we or our licensees will prevail. Our and our licensees\u2019 existing patents could be invalidated, found unenforceable or found not to cover generic forms of our or our licensees\u2019 products. If Teva or other ANDA filers were to receive FDA approval to sell a generic version of our products or the products from which we receive revenue and/or prevail in any patent litigation with respect to such products, such products would become subject to increased competition, and our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Regulatory or Legal Matters\nLitigation or arbitration filed against Alkermes, including securities litigation, or regulatory actions (such as citizens petitions) filed against regulatory agencies in respect of our products, may result in financial losses, harm our reputation, divert management resources, negatively impact the approval of our products, or otherwise negatively impact our business.\nWe are, and may in the future become, involved in various legal proceedings, including those asserting violations of securities and/or fraud and abuse laws and those asserting claims related to product liability, intellectual property and/or contractual arrangements. Such proceedings may involve claims for, or the possibility of, damages or fines and penalties involving substantial amounts of money or other relief, including but not limited to civil or criminal fines and penalties. For example, in December 2018 and January 2019, two purported stockholders of ours filed putative class actions against us and certain of our officers on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of our securities alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on allegedly false or misleading statements and omissions regarding our regulatory submission for ALKS 5461, our drug candidate for the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder, and the FDA\u2019s review and consideration of that submission. This and other legal proceedings, and the preparation therefor, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business. Moreover, if any of these legal proceedings were to result in an adverse outcome, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and harm our business.\nWe have been, and may continue to be, the subject of certain government inquiries or requests for documentation. For example, we have received a subpoena and civil investigative demands from U.S. state and federal authorities for documents related to VIVITROL. We are cooperating with the government in each instance. If, as a result of government requests, proceedings are initiated, including under the U.S. federal anti-kickback statute and False Claims Act and state False Claims Acts, and we are found to have violated one or more applicable laws, we may be subject to significant liability, including without limitation, civil fines, criminal fines and penalties, civil damages and exclusion from U.S. federal funded healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and may be required to enter into a corporate integrity or other settlement with the government, any of which could materially affect our reputation, business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Conduct giving rise to such liability could also form the basis for private civil litigation by third-party payers or other persons allegedly harmed by such conduct. In addition, if some of our existing business practices are challenged as unlawful, we may have to change those practices, including those of our sales force, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nFurther, our liability insurance coverage may not be sufficient to satisfy, or may not cover, any expenses or liabilities that may arise. Additionally, regardless of whether or not there is merit to the claims underlying any lawsuits or government inquiries of which we are subject, or whether or not we are found as a result of such lawsuits or inquiries to have violated any applicable laws, such lawsuits and inquiries can be expensive to defend or respond to, may divert the attention of our management and other resources that would otherwise be engaged in managing our business, and may further cause significant and potentially irreparable harm to our public reputation.\nWe have been, and may again be, the subject of citizen petitions that request that the FDA refuse to approve, delay approval of, or impose additional approval requirements for our NDAs. If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of the NDA in question. Even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while it considers and responds to the petition, or may impose additional approval requirements as a result of such petition. These outcomes and others could adversely affect our share price as well as our ability to generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of our products and products using our proprietary technologies.\nThe clinical study or commercial use of our products may cause unintended side effects or adverse reactions, or incidents of misuse may occur, which could adversely affect our products, business and share price.\nWe cannot predict whether the clinical or commercial use of our products will produce undesirable or unintended side effects that have not been evident in the use of, or in clinical trials conducted for, such products to date. The administration of drugs in humans carries the inherent risk of product liability claims whether or not the drugs are actually the cause of an injury. Our products may cause, or may appear to have caused, injury or dangerous drug interactions, and we may not learn about or understand those effects until the products have been administered to study participants or patients for a prolonged period of time. Additionally, incidents of product misuse may occur.\nThese events, among others, could result in product recalls or additional regulatory controls (including additional regulatory scrutiny, REMS programs, and requirements for additional labeling) or product liability actions. As our development activities progress and we continue to have commercial sales, our product liability insurance coverage may be inadequate to satisfy liabilities that arise, we may be unable to obtain adequate coverage at an acceptable cost or at all, or our insurer may disclaim coverage as to a future claim. This could prevent or limit the development or commercialization of our products. In addition, the reporting of adverse safety events involving our products, including instances of product misuse, and public rumors about such events could cause our product sales or share price to decline or experience periods of volatility. These types of events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nIf there are changes in, or we fail to comply with the extensive legal and regulatory requirements affecting the healthcare industry, we could face costs, penalties and a loss of business.\nOur activities, and the activities of our licensees and third-party providers, are subject to extensive government regulation. Government regulation by various national, state and local agencies includes detailed inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, marketing and promotion, adverse event reporting, sampling, distribution, recordkeeping, storage, and disposal practices. Achieving compliance with these regulations substantially increases the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approvals to market newly developed and existing products. Government regulatory actions, including audits, records requests and inspections of manufacturing facilities, can result in delay in the release of products, seizure or recall of products, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the manufacture and sale of products, and other regulatory enforcement actions, including the levying of civil fines or criminal penalties, the issuance of a warning letter, or the imposition of an injunction. Biopharmaceutical companies also have been the target of government lawsuits and investigations alleging violations of government regulation, including claims asserting submission of incorrect pricing information, impermissible off-label promotion of pharmaceutical products, payments intended to influence the referral of healthcare business, submission of false claims for government reimbursement, antitrust violations and violations related to environmental matters.\nWhile we have implemented numerous risk mitigation measures, we cannot guarantee that we, our employees, our licensees, our consultants or our contractors are, or will be, in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and interpretations of the applicability of these laws to our products, operations and marketing practices. If we or our agents fail to comply with any of those regulations or laws, a range of actions could result, including the termination of clinical trials, the failure to approve a product, restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of our products from the market, significant fines, exclusion from government healthcare programs or other sanctions or litigation.\nChanges affecting the healthcare industry, including new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to patent protection and enforcement, access to healthcare, and product pricing and marketing, could also adversely affect our revenues and our potential to be profitable. For example, the costs of prescription pharmaceuticals in the U.S. has been the subject of considerable discussion in the U.S. and the new administration may seek to address such costs through new legislative and/or administrative measures. Such changes in laws, regulations or decisions or in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations and decisions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur business involves environmental, health and safety risks.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials and chemicals and is subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and to periodic inspections for possible violations of these laws and regulations. Under certain of these laws and regulations, we could be liable for any contamination at our current or former properties or third-party waste disposal sites. In addition to significant remediation costs, contamination can give rise to third-party claims for fines, penalties, natural resource damages, personal injury and damage (including property damage). The costs of compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are significant. We have developed and implemented a proprietary risk mitigation program to preemptively identify and address environmental, health, safety and security risks; however, there can be no assurance that a violation of current or future environmental, health or safety laws or regulations, will not occur. Any violations, even if inadvertent or accidental, or the cost of compliance with any resulting order, fine or liability that may be imposed, could materially adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, cash flows and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition and Tax Matters\nWe may not become profitable on a sustained basis.\nAt December 31, 2020, our accumulated deficit was $1.5 billion, which was primarily the result of net losses incurred from 1987, the year Alkermes, Inc., was founded, through December 31, 2020, partially offset by net income over certain fiscal periods.\nOur ability to achieve sustained profitability in the future will depend on our ability to grow and diversify our revenue and effectively and efficiently manage our costs. Factors that may impact our future revenue, and in turn our future profitability, include our or our licensees\u2019 (as applicable) ability to:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully commercialize VIVITROL, the ARISTADA product family, RISPERDAL CONSTA, INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION, INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA, FAMPYRA and any other marketed products for which we earn revenue in the countries in which such products are approved;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully develop, and obtain and maintain regulatory approval for, products both in the U.S. and in other countries;\n\u2022\nmanufacture our products and third-party products efficiently and in a cost-effective manner;\n\u2022\nobtain adequate reimbursement coverage for our products from insurance companies, government programs and other third-party payers; and\n\u2022\nachieve certain product development and sales milestones under our collaborative arrangements.\nFactors that may impact our future spend, and in turn our future profitability, include:\n\u2022\nthe scope of our research and development activities, including the number of products, indications or new technologies that we may pursue, and our ability to share development costs through potential collaborations;\n\u2022\nthe time and expense required to pursue FDA and/or other regulatory approvals for our products;\n\u2022\nthe time and expense required to prosecute, enforce, defend and/or challenge patent and other IP rights;\n\u2022\nthe cost of operating and maintaining our manufacturing and research facilities;\n\u2022\nthe costs of doing business with third-party vendors, including suppliers, manufacturers, packagers and distributors;\n\u2022\nthe cost of possible licenses or acquisitions of technologies, compounds or product rights or the potential acquisition of other assets, including equipment, facilities or businesses;\n\u2022\nthe costs related to potential litigation, arbitration or government requests for information;\n\u2022\nthe costs of defending against potential proxy contests or other activist shareholder actions; and\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with recruiting, compensating and retaining a highly skilled workforce in an environment where competition for such employees is intense.\nCertain U.S. holders of our ordinary shares may suffer adverse tax consequences if any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are characterized as a \u201ccontrolled foreign corporation\u201d.\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law. This legislation significantly changed U.S. tax law by, among other things, changing the rules which determine whether a foreign corporation is treated for U.S. tax purposes as a controlled foreign corporation (\u201cCFC\u201d) for taxable years ended December 31, 2017 and onwards. The impact of this change on certain holders of our ordinary shares is uncertain and could be adverse, including potential income inclusions and reporting requirements for U.S. persons (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) who are treated as owning (directly or indirectly) at least 10% of the value or voting power of our shares. The determination of CFC status is complex and includes attribution rules, the application of which are not entirely certain. These changes to the attribution rules relating to the determination of CFC status make it possible that one or more of our non-U.S. subsidiaries will be classified as a CFC. Existing and prospective investors should consult their tax advisers regarding the potential application of these rules to their investments in us.\nSee \u201cCertain Irish and United States Federal Income Tax Considerations - United States Federal Income Tax Considerations\u201d in our Form S-1/A, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2012, for additional discussion with respect to other potential U.S. federal income tax consequences of investments in us.\nIf goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we could have to take significant charges against earnings.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had $111.2 million of amortizable intangible assets and $92.9 million of goodwill. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\u201cGAAP\u201d), we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets have been impaired. Amortizing intangible assets will be assessed for impairment in the event of an impairment indicator. Any reduction or impairment of the value of goodwill or other intangible assets will result in a charge against earnings, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and shareholders\u2019 equity in future periods.\nOur effective tax rate may increase.\nAs a global biopharmaceutical company, we are subject to taxation in a number of different jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places that we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of these places. Our effective tax rate may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the distribution of our profits or losses between the jurisdictions where we operate and differences in interpretation of tax laws. In addition, the tax laws of any jurisdiction in which we operate may change in the future, which could impact our effective tax rate. Tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate may audit us. If we are unsuccessful in defending any tax positions adopted in our submitted tax returns, we may be required to pay taxes for prior periods, interest, fines or penalties, and may be obligated to pay increased taxes in the future, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur deferred tax assets may not be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $86.2 million in net deferred tax assets in the U.S. Included in this amount was approximately $2.1 million of U.S. federal net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards and $40.9 million of research and development tax credit carryforwards that can be used to reduce U.S. taxable income or offset federal tax in future periods. These carryforwards will expire within the next twenty years. It is possible that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, especially if we incur losses in the U.S. in the future. Losses may arise from unforeseen operating events or the occurrence of significant excess tax benefits arising from the exercise of stock options and/or the vesting of restricted stock units. Unless we are able to generate sufficient taxable income in the future, a substantial valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of our U.S. deferred tax assets may be required, which would materially increase our expenses in the period the valuation allowance is recognized and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, we have included within our U.S. net deferred tax assets of $86.2 million an amount of $40.5 million relating to employee share-based compensation expense. It is possible that a material portion of this deferred tax asset will not be realized, especially if the price of our ordinary shares remains at its current level (refer to \u201cItem 5. Market for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\u201d in this Annual Report for details of the price of our ordinary shares). Unless the price of our ordinary shares increases, we will incur a deferred tax expense as our U.S.-based employees exercise or forfeit their stock options and their restricted stock unit awards vest. This could materially increase our tax expense and may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe business combination of Alkermes, Inc. and the drug technology business (\u201cEDT\u201d) of Elan Corporation, plc may limit our ability to use our tax attributes to offset taxable income, if any, generated from such business combination.\nOn September 16, 2011, the businesses of Alkermes, Inc. and EDT were combined under Alkermes plc (this combination is referred to as the \u201cBusiness Combination\u201d). For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a corporation is generally considered tax resident in the place of its incorporation. Because we are incorporated in Ireland, we should be deemed an Irish corporation under these general rules. However, Section 7874 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) generally provides that a corporation organized outside the U.S. that acquires substantially all of the assets of a corporation organized in the U.S. will be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income tax purposes if shareholders of the acquired U.S. corporation own at least 80% (of either the voting power or the value) of the stock of the acquiring foreign corporation after the acquisition by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation, and the \u201cexpanded affiliated group\u201d (as defined in Section 7874) that includes the acquiring corporation does not have substantial business activities in the country in which it is organized.\nIn addition, Section 7874 provides that if a corporation organized outside the U.S. acquires substantially all of the assets of a corporation organized in the U.S., the taxable income of the U.S. corporation during the period beginning on the date the first assets are acquired as part of the acquisition, through the date which is ten years after the last date assets are acquired as part of the acquisition, shall be no less than the income or gain recognized by reason of the transfer during such period or by reason of a license of property by the expatriated entity after such acquisition to a foreign affiliate during such period, which is referred to as the \u201cinversion gain,\u201d if shareholders of the acquired U.S. corporation own at least 60% (of either the voting power or the value) of the stock of the acquiring foreign corporation after the acquisition by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation, and the \u201cexpanded affiliated group\u201d of the acquiring corporation does not have substantial business activities in the country in which it is\norganized. If this rule was to apply to the Business Combination, among other things, Alkermes, Inc. would have been restricted in its ability to use the approximately $274.0 million of U.S. federal NOL carryforwards and $38.0 million of U.S. state NOL carryforwards that it had as of March 31, 2011. We do not believe that either of these limitations should apply as a result of the Business Combination. However, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) could assert a contrary position, in which case we could become involved in tax controversy with the IRS regarding possible additional U.S. tax liability. If we were to be unsuccessful in resolving any such tax controversy in our favor, we could be liable for significantly greater U.S. federal and state income tax than we anticipate being liable for through the Business Combination, which would place further demands on our cash needs.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business.\nIn March 2018, we amended and refinanced the term loan under our credit agreement (previously referred to as \u201cTerm Loan B-1\u201d, and as so amended and refinanced, the \u201c2023 Term Loans\u201d), in order to, among other things, extend the due date of the loan from September 25, 2021 to March 26, 2023, reduce the interest payable thereon from LIBOR plus 2.75% with a LIBOR floor of 0.75% to LIBOR plus 2.25% with a 0% LIBOR floor and increase covenant flexibility. As of December 31, 2020, our borrowings consisted of $276.4 million outstanding under the 2023 Term Loans.\nThe 2023 Term Loans are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the combined company assets and properties of Alkermes plc and most of its subsidiaries, which serve as guarantors. The agreements governing the 2023 Term Loans include a number of restrictive covenants that, among other things, and subject to certain exceptions and baskets, impose operating and financial restrictions on us.\nOur failure to comply with these restrictions or to make these payments could lead to an event of default that could result in an acceleration of the indebtedness. Our future operating results may not be sufficient to ensure compliance with these covenants or to remedy any such default. In the event of an acceleration of this indebtedness, we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make any accelerated payments.\nDiscontinuation, reform or replacement of LIBOR, or uncertainty related to the potential for any of the foregoing, may adversely affect us.\nIn July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that LIBOR could be effectively discontinued after 2023. In addition, other regulators have suggested reforming or replacing other benchmark rates. The discontinuation, reform or replacement of LIBOR or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuation, reform or replacement may negatively impact the volatility of LIBOR rates, liquidity, our access to funding required to operate our business, or the trading market for our 2023 Term Loans.\nUnder our 2023 Term Loans, if the administrative agent determines that LIBOR is not reasonably ascertainable, or is notified by our lenders that LIBOR does not adequately and fairly reflect the costs to our lenders of maintaining the loans, we would be required to pay interest under an alternative base rate which could cause the amount of interest payable on the 2023 Term Loans to be materially different than expected. We may choose in the future to pursue an amendment to our 2023 Term Loans to provide for a transition mechanism or other alternative reference rate in anticipation of LIBOR\u2019s discontinuation, but we can give no assurance that we will be able to reach agreement with our lenders on any such amendment.\nCurrency exchange rates may affect revenues and expenses.\nWe conduct a large portion of our business in international markets. For example, we derive a majority of our RISPERDAL CONSTA revenues and all of our FAMPYRA, XEPLION and TREVICTA revenues from sales in countries other than the U.S., and these sales are denominated in non-U.S. dollar (\u201cUSD\u201d) currencies. We also incur substantial operating costs in Ireland and face exposure to changes in the exchange ratio of the USD and the euro arising from expenses and payables at our Irish operations that are settled in euro. Our efforts to mitigate the impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates may not be successful. As a result, currency fluctuations among our reporting currency, USD, and the currencies in which we do business will affect our results of operations, often in unpredictable ways. See \u201cItem 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d in this Annual Report for additional information relating to our foreign currency exchange rate risk.\nIf we identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, our ability to meet our reporting obligations and the trading price of our ordinary shares could be negatively affected.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Accordingly, a material weakness increases the risk that the financial information we report contains material errors.\nWe regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies. In\naddition, we are required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to report annually on our internal control over financial reporting. Any system of internal controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. If we, or our independent registered public accounting firm, determine that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective, or we discover areas that need improvement in the future, these shortcomings could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results, and the price of our ordinary shares could be negatively affected.\nIf we cannot conclude that we have effective internal control over our financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified opinion regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could lead to a decline in the trading price of our ordinary shares. Failure to comply with reporting requirements could also subject us to sanctions and/or investigations by the SEC, the Nasdaq or other regulatory authorities.\nRisks Related to our Ordinary Shares\nThe market price for our ordinary shares has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future, and could decline significantly.\nThe market price for our ordinary shares has fluctuated significantly from time to time. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the closing price of our ordinary shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market ranged from $13.06 to $22.00 per share. The market price of our ordinary shares is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and industry factors, our results of operations, our ability to maintain and increase sales of our products, the success of our key development programs, our ability to achieve profitability, and other factors, including the risk factors described in this Annual Report. The stock market in general, including the market for biopharmaceutical companies, has experienced extreme price and trading volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In particular, negative publicity regarding pricing and price increases by pharmaceutical companies, and potential legislation to regulate drug pricing, has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, the market for biopharmaceutical companies. These broad market and industry factors have harmed, and in the future may seriously harm, the market price of our ordinary shares, regardless of our operating performance. We have also experienced significant volatility in the market price of our ordinary shares based on our business performance, including in relation to our commercial sales and the financial guidance that we issue for such sales, results from our clinical development programs, and events relating to regulatory actions and interactions related to our product candidates and commercial products. For example, a series of adverse actions by the FDA in 2018 relating to our NDA for ALKS 5461, our investigational product for the treatment of major depressive disorder, caused the market price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist shareholders.\nProxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders have been waged against many companies in our industry over the last several years. Activist shareholders may agitate, either publicly or privately, for changes to a company\u2019s board of directors, management, structure, spend or strategic direction, among other things. Such actions may cause significant disruption to a company\u2019s operations and cause a company to expend a significant amount of time and resources in responding to their requests.\nIn December 2020, we engaged in extensive dialogue with an activist shareholder, resulting in our entry into a cooperation agreement with such activist in which we agreed on certain matters relating to our Board and affirmed our commitment to, and plans for, meeting certain financial targets over a multi-year period. These discussions resulted in the expenditure of significant time and energy by management and our Board and required dedication by the Company of significant resources. We have undertaken, and will continue to implement, several initiatives in order to achieve the financial targets, but there is no assurance that we will achieve these targets, or that doing so will decrease the likelihood of activist shareholder engagement in the future.\nIf faced with a proxy contest or other activist shareholder request or action in the future, we may not be able or willing to respond successfully to the contest, action, or request, which could be significantly disruptive to our business. Even if we are successful, our business could be adversely affected by any proxy contest or activist shareholder request or action involving us because:\n\u2022\nresponding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting operations and diverting the attention of management and employees, and can lead to uncertainty;\n\u2022\nperceived uncertainties as to the future direction of the Company or its business may result in the loss of potential acquisitions, collaborations or in-licensing opportunities, and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners; and\n\u2022\nif individuals are elected to our board of directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our strategic plan in a timely manner and create additional value for our shareholders.\nAny such activist shareholder contests, actions or requests, or the mere public presence of activist shareholders among our shareholder base, could cause the market price for our ordinary shares to experience periods of significant volatility.\nRisks Related to Information Security and Data Privacy\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including IP, our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers and partners, as well as personally identifiable information of patients, clinical trial participants and employees. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has required us to implement a global remote work policy for our employees who are able to work remotely. Our partners and third-party providers also possess certain of our sensitive data. The secure maintenance of all such information and the secure performance of our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems are critical to our operations and business strategy.\nAs the dependency on our IT systems increases, the confidentially, integrity and availability of systems and the data that they store is critical to managing our business. While we take prudent measures to secure our IT systems, the risk still exists that such systems may become compromised by successful breaches, malfeasance, human error or technological fault. Certain types of attacks or breaches on our IT systems or infrastructure may go undetected for a prolonged period. Any breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or breach of our, our partners\u2019 or our third-party providers\u2019 technology systems could compromise such IT systems and the information stored there could be accessed, modified, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen, which could result in legal claims or proceedings and liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and adversely affect our business. Although we retain cybersecurity insurance to cover costs and expenses related to a breach or similar event, any such costs and expenses may exceed the insurance available.\nWe may be subject to numerous and varying privacy and security laws, and our failure to comply could result in penalties and reputational damage.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations covering data privacy and the protection of personal information, including health information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues which may affect our business. In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information. Each of these laws is subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to penalties or sanctions, including criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information from a covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HIPAA.\nNumerous other countries have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information as well. The EU and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. In the EU, for example, the GDPR governs the processing of personal data. The GDPR imposes significant obligations on controllers and processors of personal data, including, high standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data, robust notification requirements to individuals about the processing of their personal data, a strong individual data rights regime, mandatory data breach notifications, limitations on the retention of personal data and increased requirements pertaining to health data, and strict rules and restrictions on the transfer of personal data outside of the EU, including to the U.S. The GDPR also imposes additional obligations on, and required contractual provisions to be included in, contracts between companies subject to the GDPR and their third-party processors that relate to the processing of personal data. The GDPR allows EU member states to make additional laws and regulations further limiting the processing of genetic, biometric or health data.\nAdoption of the GDPR increased our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and may require us to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance. Any failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR and applicable national data protection laws of EU member states could lead to regulatory enforcement actions and significant administrative and/or financial penalties against us (fines of up to \u20ac20,000,000 or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher), and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 76736, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ALKS"}
