{"cik": "1001082", "company": "DISH Network CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nCompetition and Economic Risks\nWe face intense and increasing competition from satellite television providers, cable companies and telecommunications companies, especially as the pay-TV industry has matured and bundled offers have become more prevalent, which may require us to further increase subscriber acquisition and retention spending or accept lower subscriber activations and higher subscriber churn.\nOur business has historically focused on providing pay-TV services and we have traditionally competed against satellite television providers and cable companies, some of whom have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. Many of these competitors offer video services bundled with broadband, wireless services, HD offerings, interactive services and video on demand services. Bundled offers combining video, broadband and/or wireless services have become more prevalent and competitive. In some cases, certain competitors have been able to potentially subsidize the price of video services with the price of broadband and/or wireless services. With respect to our DISH branded pay-TV services, we and our competitors increasingly must seek to attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from each other\u2019s existing subscriber bases rather than from first-time purchasers of pay-TV services. In addition, because other pay-TV providers may be seeking to attract a greater proportion of their new subscribers from our existing subscriber base, we may be required to increase retention spending or we may provide greater discounts or credits to acquire and retain subscribers who may spend less on our services. If our Pay-TV ARPU decreases or does not increase commensurate with increases in programming or other costs, our margins may be reduced and the long-term value of a subscriber would then decrease. In addition, our Sling TV subscribers generally have lower priced programming packages than our DISH branded pay-TV subscribers. Accordingly, an increase in Sling TV subscribers has a negative impact on our Pay-TV ARPU.\nCompetition has intensified in recent years as the pay-TV industry has matured and the growth of fiber-based pay-TV services offered by telecommunications companies such as Verizon and AT&T continues. These fiber-based pay-TV services have significantly greater capacity, enabling the telecommunications companies to offer substantial HD programming content as well as bundled services. This increasingly competitive environment may require us to increase subscriber acquisition and retention spending or accept lower subscriber activations and higher subscriber churn. Further, as a result of this increased competitive environment and the maturation of the pay-TV industry, future growth opportunities of our DISH branded pay-TV business may be limited and our margins may be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nIn addition, traditional cable and satellite television providers have begun, and other companies such as programmers have indicated they also may begin, to offer smaller packages of programming channels directly to customers, at prices lower than our video service package offerings. These offerings could adversely affect demand for our Pay-TV services or cause us to modify our programming packages, which may reduce our margins.\nMoreover, mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances among cable television providers, telecommunications companies and others may result in, among other things, greater financial leverage and increase the availability of offerings from providers capable of bundling video, broadband and telephone services in competition with our services, and may exacerbate the risks described above. For example, during May 2015, Charter announced its pending acquisition of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, which would create New Charter, the second largest cable television provider and third largest MPVD in the U.S. This acquisition is currently undergoing regulatory review and has not been completed. The proposed transaction, if ultimately completed, will create a duopoly, resulting in two broadband providers, New Charter and Comcast, controlling about 90% of the nation\u2019s high-speed broadband homes between them. In addition, the impact of New Charter would cause a significant proportion of the combined company\u2019s high-speed broadband subscribers to lack access to alternative high-speed broadband options. Further, if the proposed transaction ultimately is completed, New Charter would be able to, among other things, foreclose or degrade our online video offerings at various points in the broadband pipe; impose data caps on consumers who access our online video offerings; and pressure third-party content owners and programmers to withhold online rights from us and raise other MVPDs\u2019 third-party programming costs, including us.\nIn addition, in July 2015, AT&T completed its acquisition of DirecTV, our direct competitor and the largest satellite TV provider in the U.S. As a result of this acquisition, DirecTV, among other things, has increased access to capital, access to AT&T\u2019s nationwide platform for wireless mobile video, and the ability to more seamlessly bundle its video services with AT&T\u2019s broadband Internet access and wireless services. The combined company may also be able to, among other things, pressure third-party content owners and programmers to withhold online rights from us; utilize its increased leverage over third-party content owners and programmers to reduce the price it pays for programming at the expense of other MVPDs, including us; thwart our entry into the wireless market, by, among other things, refusing to enter into data roaming agreements with us; underutilize key orbital spectrum resources that could be more efficiently used by us; foreclose or degrade our online video offerings at various points in the broadband pipe; and impose data caps on consumers who access our online video offerings.\nOur Pay-TV subscriber base has recently been declining due to, among other things, the factors described above. There can be no assurance that our Pay-TV subscriber base will not continue to decline. In the event that our Pay-TV subscriber base continues to decline, it could have a material adverse long-term effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nChanging consumer behavior and competition from digital media companies that provide or facilitate the delivery of video content via the Internet may reduce our gross new subscriber activations and may cause our subscribers to purchase fewer services from us or to cancel our services altogether, resulting in less revenue to us.\nOur business has historically focused on providing pay-TV services, including our DISH branded and Sling branded pay-TV services. We face competition from providers of digital media, including, among others, Netflix, Hulu, Apple, Amazon, Google and Verizon that offer online services distributing movies, television shows and other video programming. Some of these companies have larger customer bases, stronger brand recognition and greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. In addition, traditional providers of video entertainment, including broadcasters, cable channels and telecommunications companies, are increasing their Internet-based video offerings. Some of these services charge nominal or no fees for access to their content, which could adversely affect demand for our Pay-TV services. Moreover, new technologies have been, and will likely continue to be, developed that further increase the number of competitors we face with respect to video services, including competition from piracy-based video offerings.\nThese products and services are also driving rapid changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content and access communications services. In particular, with the large increase in the number of consumers with broadband service, a significant amount of video content has become available through online content providers for users to stream and view on their personal computers, televisions and other devices. Similarly, consumers have increased access to video content via mobile devices. These technological advancements and changes in consumer behavior with regard to the means by which consumers obtain video content may cause DISH subscribers to disconnect our services (\u201ccord cutting\u201d), downgrade to smaller, less expensive programming packages (\u201ccord shaving\u201d) or elect to purchase through online content providers a certain portion of the services that they would have historically purchased from us, such as pay per view movies, resulting in less revenue to us. There can be no assurance that our Pay-TV services will be able to compete with these other providers of digital media. Therefore, these technological advancements and changes in consumer behavior could reduce our gross new subscriber activations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or otherwise disrupt our business.\nOur failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to competition or changes in consumer behavior, including with respect to younger consumers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or otherwise disrupt our business.\nEconomic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect our ability to grow or maintain our business.\nA substantial majority of our revenue comes from residential customers whose spending patterns may be affected by economic weakness and uncertainty. Our ability to grow or maintain our business may be adversely affected by economic weakness and uncertainty and other factors that may adversely affect the pay-TV industry. In particular, economic weakness and uncertainty could result in the following:\n\u00b7\nFewer gross new subscriber activations and increased subscriber churn. We could face fewer gross new subscriber activations and increased subscriber churn due to, among other things: (i) certain economic factors that impact consumers, including, among others, rising interest rates, a potential downturn in the housing market in the United States (including a decline in housing starts) and higher unemployment, which could lead to a lack of consumer confidence and lower discretionary spending; (ii) increased price competition for our products and services; and (iii) the potential loss of independent retailers, who generate a significant percentage of our new subscribers, because many of them are small businesses that are more susceptible to the negative effects of economic weakness. In particular, subscriber churn may increase with respect to subscribers who purchase our lower tier programming packages and who may be more sensitive to economic weakness, including, among others, our pay-in-advance subscribers.\n\u00b7\nLower pay-TV average monthly revenue per subscriber (\u201cPay-TV ARPU\u201d). Our subscribers may disconnect our services and a growing share of pay-TV customers are \u201ccord shaving\u201d to downgrade to smaller, less expensive programming packages or electing to purchase through online content providers a certain portion of the services that they would have historically purchased from us, such as pay per view movies. Cord cutting and/or cord shaving by our subscribers could negatively impact our Pay-TV ARPU.\n\u00b7\nHigher subscriber acquisition and retention costs. Our profits may be adversely affected by increased subscriber acquisition and retention costs necessary to attract and retain subscribers during a period of economic weakness.\nOur competitors may be able to leverage their relationships with programmers to reduce their programming costs and offer exclusive content that will place them at a competitive advantage to us.\nThe cost of programming represents the largest percentage of our overall costs. Certain of our competitors own directly or are affiliated with companies that own programming content that may enable them to obtain lower programming costs or offer exclusive programming that may be attractive to prospective subscribers. Unlike our larger cable and satellite competitors, some of which also provide IPTV services, we have not made significant investments in programming providers. For example, in January 2011, the FCC and the Department of Justice approved a transaction between Comcast and General Electric pursuant to which they joined their programming properties, including NBC, Bravo and many others that are available in the majority of our programming packages, in a venture, NBCUniversal, controlled by Comcast. During March 2013, Comcast completed the acquisition of substantially all of General Electric\u2019s remaining interest in NBCUniversal. This transaction may affect us adversely by, among other things, making it more difficult for us to obtain access to NBCUniversal\u2019s programming networks on nondiscriminatory and fair terms, or at all. The FCC conditioned its approval on, among other things, Comcast complying with the terms of the FCC\u2019s order on network neutrality, even if that order is vacated by judicial or legislative action, and Comcast licensing its affiliated content to us, other traditional pay-TV providers and certain providers of video services over the Internet on fair and nondiscriminatory terms and conditions, including, among others, price. If Comcast does not license its affiliated content to us on fair and nondiscriminatory terms and conditions, we can seek binding arbitration and continue to carry such content while the arbitration is pending. However, it is uncertain how these conditions may be interpreted and enforced by the FCC; therefore, we cannot predict the practical effect of these conditions.\nOur OTT Sling TV Internet-based services face certain risks, including, among others, significant competition.\nPrior to 2015, we launched our Sling International video programming service (formerly known as DishWorld). During 2015, we launched our Sling domestic and Sling Latino services. We market our Sling TV services primarily to consumers who do not subscribe to traditional satellite and cable pay-TV services.\nOur Sling TV services face a number of risks, including, among others, the following, which may have a material adverse effect on our Sling TV service offerings:\n\u00b7\nWe face significant competition from several content providers and other companies including, among others, Netflix, Hulu, Apple, Amazon, Google and Verizon, some of which have larger customer bases, stronger brand recognition, and significant financial, marketing and other resources, as well as competition from piracy based video offerings.\n\u00b7\nWe offer a limited amount of programming content, and there can be no assurances that we will be able to increase the amount or type of programming content that we may offer to keep pace with, or to differentiate our Sling TV services from, other providers of online video content;\n\u00b7\nWe rely on streaming-capable devices to deliver our Sling TV services, and if we are not successful in maintaining existing, and creating new, relationships, or if we encounter technological, content licensing or other impediments to our streaming content, our ability to grow our Sling TV services could be adversely impacted;\n\u00b7\nWe may incur significant expenses to market our Sling TV services and build brand awareness, which could have a negative impact on the profitability of our Sling TV services;\n\u00b7\nSince we rely upon the ability of consumers to access our Sling TV services through an Internet connection, changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks, such as implementing bandwidth caps or usage-based fees, could adversely impact our Sling TV services. In addition, many network operators that provide consumers with broadband service also provide these consumers with video programming, and these network operators may have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success. For example, as a result of AT&T\u2019s recent acquisition of DirecTV, and if the proposed New Charter merger is completed, these risks may be exacerbated to the extent these and other network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data;\n\u00b7\nWe may not be able to scale our systems and operational practices related to our Sling TV services to effectively and reliably handle growth in subscribers and features related to our services;\n\u00b7\nOur Sling TV services have functional limitations that in many cases our competitors are not constrained by, such as not being able to view content on more than one device simultaneously, and not providing consumers a feature to record content for future viewing. If we are unable to add such functionality to our Sling TV services in the future, our ability to compete with other offerings could be adversely impacted;\n\u00b7\nThe adoption or modification of laws and regulations relating to the Internet could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we conduct our Sling TV services and could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model; and\n\u00b7\nWe rely on EchoStar to provide the streaming delivery technology and infrastructure to support our Sling TV services. In addition, we license our OTT service brand name \u201cSling\u201d from EchoStar, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to license the \u201cSling\u201d brand name on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe face increasing competition from other distributors of unique programming services such as foreign language and sports programming that may limit our ability to maintain subscribers that desire these unique programming services.\nWe face increasing competition from other distributors of unique programming services such as foreign language and sports programming, including programming distributed over the Internet. There can be no assurance that we will maintain subscribers that desire these unique programming services. For example, the increasing availability of foreign language programming from our competitors, which in certain cases has resulted from our inability to renew programming agreements on an exclusive basis or at all, as well as competition from piracy-based video offerings, could contribute to an increase in our subscriber churn. Our agreements with distributors of foreign language programming have varying expiration dates, and some agreements are on a month-to-month basis. There can be no assurance that we will be able to grow or maintain subscribers that desire these unique programming services such as foreign language and sports programming.\nOperational and Service Delivery Risks\nIf we do not continue improving our operational performance and customer satisfaction, our gross new subscriber activations may decrease and our subscriber churn may increase.\nIf we are unable to continue improving our operational performance and customer satisfaction, we may experience a decrease in gross new subscriber activations and an increase in subscriber churn, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To improve our operational performance, we continue to make investments in staffing, training, information systems, and other initiatives, primarily in our call center and in-home service operations. These investments are intended to help combat inefficiencies introduced by the increasing complexity of our business, improve customer satisfaction, reduce subscriber churn, increase productivity, and allow us to scale better over the long run. We cannot, however, be certain that our spending will ultimately be successful in improving our operational performance, and if unsuccessful, we may have to incur higher costs to improve our operational performance. While we believe that such costs will be outweighed by longer-term benefits, there can be no assurance when or if we will realize these benefits at all. If we are unable to improve our operational performance, our future gross new subscriber activations and existing subscriber churn may be negatively impacted, which could in turn adversely affect our revenue growth and results of operations.\nIf our gross new subscriber activations decrease, or if our subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition costs or retention costs increase, our financial performance will be adversely affected.\nWe may incur increased costs to acquire new subscribers and retain existing subscribers. Our subscriber acquisition costs could increase as a result of increased spending for advertising and, with respect to our DISH branded pay-TV services, the installation of more HD and DVR receivers, which are generally more expensive than other receivers. Meanwhile, retention costs may be driven higher by providing retention credits and, with respect to our DISH branded pay-TV services, by increased upgrades of existing subscribers\u2019 equipment to HD and DVR receivers. Additionally, certain of our promotions, including, among others, pay-in-advance, allow consumers with relatively lower credit scores to become subscribers. These subscribers typically churn at a higher rate.\nOur subscriber acquisition costs and our subscriber retention costs can vary significantly from period to period and can cause material variability to our net income (loss) and adjusted free cash flow. Any material increase in subscriber acquisition or retention costs from current levels could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProgramming expenses are increasing and could adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations.\nOur programming costs currently represent the largest component of our total expense and we expect these costs to continue to increase. The pay-TV industry has continued to experience an increase in the cost of programming, especially local broadcast channels and sports programming. In addition, certain programming costs are rising at a much faster rate than wages or inflation. These factors may be exacerbated by the increasing trend of consolidation in the media industry, which may further increase our programming expenses. Our ability to compete successfully will depend, among other things, on our ability to continue to obtain desirable programming and deliver it to our subscribers at competitive prices.\nWhen offering new programming, or upon expiration of existing contracts, programming suppliers have historically attempted to increase the rates that they charge us for programming. We expect this practice to continue, which, if successful, would increase our programming costs. In addition, our programming expenses may also increase as we add programming to our video services or distribute existing programming to our customers through additional delivery platforms, such as Sling TV. As a result, our margins may face further pressure if we are unable to renew our long-term programming contracts on acceptable pricing and other economic terms. Alternatively, to attempt to mitigate the effect of price increases or for other reasons, we may elect not to carry or may be unable to carry certain channels, which could adversely affect our subscriber growth or result in higher churn.\nIn addition, increases in programming costs generally cause us to increase the rates that we charge our subscribers, which could in turn cause our existing Pay-TV subscribers to disconnect our service or cause potential new Pay-TV subscribers to choose not to subscribe to our service. Therefore, we may be unable to pass increased programming costs on to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on others to provide the programming that we offer to our subscribers and, if we fail to obtain or lose access to this programming, our gross new subscriber activations may decline and our subscriber churn may increase.\nWe depend on third parties to provide us with programming services. Our programming agreements have remaining terms ranging from less than one to up to several years and contain various renewal, expiration and/or termination provisions. We may not be able to renew these agreements on acceptable terms or at all, and these agreements may be terminated prior to expiration of their original term. In recent years, negotiations over programming carriage contracts generally remain contentious, and certain programmers have, in the past, limited our access to their programming in connection with those negotiations and the scheduled expiration of their programming carriage contracts with us. As national and local programming interruptions and threatened programming interruptions have become more frequent in recent years, in certain cases such interruptions have had a negative impact on our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations and Pay-TV churn rate. We cannot predict with any certainty the impact to our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, net Pay-TV subscriber additions and Pay-TV churn rate resulting from programming interruptions that may occur in the future. As a result, we may at times suffer from periods of lower gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, lower net Pay-TV subscriber additions and higher Pay-TV churn rates.\nWe typically have a few programming contracts with major content providers up for renewal each year and if we are unable to renew any of these agreements or the other parties terminate the agreements, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain substitute programming, or that such substitute programming would be comparable in quality or cost to our existing programming. In addition, failure to obtain access to certain programming or loss of access to programming, particularly programming provided by major content providers and/or programming popular with our subscribers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including, among other things, our gross new subscriber activations, net subscriber additions and subscriber churn rate.\nWe may not be able to obtain necessary retransmission consent agreements at acceptable rates, or at all, from local network stations.\nThe Copyright Act generally gives satellite companies a statutory copyright license to retransmit local broadcast channels by satellite back into the market from which they originated, subject to obtaining the retransmission consent of local network stations that do not elect \u201cmust carry\u201d status, as required by the Communications Act. If we fail to reach retransmission consent agreements with such broadcasters, we cannot carry their signals. This could have an adverse effect on our strategy to compete with cable and other satellite companies that provide local signals. While we have been able to reach retransmission consent agreements with most of these local network stations, from time to time there are stations with which we have not been able to reach an agreement. We cannot be sure that we will secure these agreements or that we will secure new agreements on acceptable terms, or at all, upon the expiration of our current retransmission consent agreements, some of which are short-term. We currently have a pending lawsuit with one major broadcast television network alleging, among other things, that the PrimeTime Anytime\u2122 and AutoHop\u2122 features of the Hopper set-top box breach its retransmission consent agreement. See Note 15 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. In the event a court ultimately determines that we breached the terms of that retransmission consent agreement, we may be subject, among other things, to substantial damages and we may lose access to programming or may not be able to renew that retransmission consent agreement and other programming agreements on favorable terms or at all. Even if we ultimately prevail in this action, there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew our retransmission consent agreement or enter into a new agreement with this broadcast network. In such event, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain substitute programming, or that such substitute programming would be comparable in quality or cost to our existing programming. In recent years, national broadcasters have used their ownership of certain local broadcast stations to require us to carry additional cable programming in exchange for retransmission consent of their local broadcast stations. These requirements may place constraints on available capacity on our satellites for other programming. Furthermore, the rates we are charged for retransmitting local channels have been increasing substantially and may exceed our ability to increase our prices to our customers. We may be unable to pass these increased programming costs on to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be required to make substantial additional investments to maintain competitive programming offerings.\nWe believe that the availability and extent of HD programming and other value-added services such as access to video via mobile devices continue to be significant factors in consumers\u2019 choice among pay-TV providers. Other pay-TV providers may have more successfully marketed and promoted their HD programming packages and value-added services and may also be better equipped and have greater resources to increase their HD offerings and value-added services to respond to increasing consumer demand. In addition, even though it remains a small portion of the market, consumer demand for 3D televisions and programming, as well as higher resolution programming, such as 4K HD, will likely increase in the future. We may be required to make substantial additional investments in infrastructure to respond to competitive pressure to deliver enhanced programming, and other value-added services, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with offerings from other pay-TV providers.\nAny failure or inadequacy of our information technology infrastructure and communications systems, including without limitation those caused by cyber-attacks or other malicious activities, could disrupt or harm our business.\nThe capacity, reliability and security of our information technology hardware and software infrastructure (including our billing systems) and communications systems are important to the operation of our current business, which would suffer in the event of system failures or cyber-attacks. Likewise, our ability to expand and update our information technology infrastructure in response to our growth and changing needs is important to the continued implementation of our new service offering initiatives. Our inability to expand or upgrade our technology infrastructure could have adverse consequences, which could include, among other things, the delayed implementation of new service offerings, service or billing interruptions, and the diversion of development resources. We rely on third parties for developing key components of our information technology and communications systems and ongoing service. Some of our key systems and operations, including those supplied by third-party providers, are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. Interruption and/or failure of any of these systems could disrupt our operations, interrupt our services and damage our reputation, thus adversely impacting our ability to provide our services, retain our current subscribers and attract new subscribers.\nIn addition, although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, our information technology hardware and software infrastructure and communications systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions, including without limitation, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks and other malicious activities such as unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code, computer denial of service attacks and other events that could disrupt or harm our business. In addition, third-party providers of some of our key systems may also experience interruptions to their information technology hardware and software infrastructure and communications systems that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited or no control. We may obtain certain confidential, proprietary and personal information about our customers, personnel and vendors, and may provide this information to third parties in connection with our business. If one or more of such interruptions or failures occur to us or our third-party providers, it potentially could jeopardize such information and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our information technology hardware and software infrastructure and communications systems, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations, which could result in significant losses or reputational damage. Due to the fast-moving pace of technology, it may be difficult to detect, contain and remediate every such event. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to financial losses. Furthermore, the amount and scope of insurance we maintain may not cover expenses related to such activities or events.\nAs a result of the increasing awareness concerning the importance of safeguarding personal information, the potential misuse of such information and legislation that has been adopted or is being considered regarding the protection, privacy and security of personal information, the potential liability associated with information-related risks is increasing, particularly for businesses like ours that handle personal customer data. The occurrence of any such network or information system related events or security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Significant incidents could result in a disruption of our operations, customer dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation or a loss of customers and revenues.\nWe currently depend on EchoStar Corporation and its subsidiaries, or EchoStar, to design, develop and manufacture substantially all of our new DISH branded pay-TV set-top boxes and certain related components, to provide the vast majority of our transponder capacity, to provide digital broadcast operations and other services to us, and to provide streaming delivery technology and infrastructure for our Sling TV services. Our business would be adversely affected if EchoStar ceases to provide these products and services to us and we are unable to obtain suitable replacement products and services from third parties.\nEchoStar is our primary supplier of our DISH branded pay-TV digital set-top boxes and digital broadcast operations. In addition, EchoStar provides the vast majority of our transponder capacity, is a key supplier of related services to us, and provides streaming delivery technology and infrastructure for our Sling TV services. We purchase digital set-top boxes from EchoStar pursuant to a contract that expires on December 31, 2016. EchoStar provides digital broadcast operations to us pursuant to a contract that expires on December 31, 2016. EchoStar has no obligation to supply digital set-top boxes or digital broadcast operations to us after these dates. We may be unable to renew agreements for digital set-top boxes or digital broadcast operations with EchoStar on acceptable terms or at all. We lease the vast majority of our transponder capacity from EchoStar. Equipment, transponder leasing and digital broadcast operation costs may increase beyond our current expectations. EchoStar\u2019s inability to develop and produce, or our inability to obtain, equipment with the latest technology, or our inability to obtain transponder capacity and digital broadcast operations and other services from third parties, could adversely affect our gross new subscriber activations and subscriber churn rate and cause related revenue to decline.\nFurthermore, due to the lack of compatibility of our infrastructure with the set-top boxes of a provider other than EchoStar, any transition to a new supplier of set-top boxes could take a significant period of time to complete, cause us to incur significant costs and negatively affect our gross new subscriber activations and subscriber churn. For example, the proprietary nature of the Slingbox \u201cplaceshifting\u201d functionality and certain other technology used in EchoStar\u2019s set-top boxes may significantly limit our ability to obtain set-top boxes with the same or similar features from any other provider of set-top boxes.\nIf we were to switch to another provider of set-top boxes, we may have to implement additional infrastructure to support the set-top boxes purchased from such new provider, which could significantly increase our costs. In addition, differences in, among other things, the user interface between set-top boxes provided by EchoStar and those of any other provider could cause subscriber confusion, which could increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our gross new subscriber activations and subscriber churn. Furthermore, switching to a new provider of set-top boxes may cause a reduction in our supply of set-top boxes and thus delay our ability to ship set-top boxes, which could have a material adverse effect on our gross new subscriber activations and subscriber churn rate and cause related revenue to decline.\nTechnology in the pay-TV industry changes rapidly, and our success may depend in part on our timely introduction and implementation of, and effective investment in, new competitive products and services and more advanced equipment, and our failure to do so could cause our products and services to become obsolete and could negatively impact our business.\nTechnology in the pay-TV industry changes rapidly as new technologies are developed, which could cause our products and services to become obsolete. We and our suppliers may not be able to keep pace with technological developments. Our operating results are dependent to a significant extent upon our ability to continue to introduce new products and services and to upgrade existing products and services on a timely basis, and to reduce costs of our existing products and services. We may not be able to successfully identify new product or service opportunities or develop and market these opportunities in a timely or cost-effective manner. The research and development of new, technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and investment. The success of new product and service development depends on many factors, including among others, the following:\n\u00b7\ndifficulties and delays in the development, production, timely completion, testing and marketing of products and services;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of the products and services;\n\u00b7\nproper identification of customer need and customer acceptance of products and services;\n\u00b7\nthe development of, approval of and compliance with industry standards;\n\u00b7\nthe amount of resources we must devote to the development of new technologies; and\n\u00b7\nthe ability to differentiate our products and services and compete with other companies in the same markets.\nIf the new technologies on which we focus our research and development investments fail to achieve acceptance in the marketplace, our competitive position could be negatively impacted, causing a reduction in our revenues and earnings. For example, our competitors could use proprietary technologies that are perceived by the market as being superior. Further, after we have incurred substantial costs, one or more of the products or services under our development, or under development by one or more of our strategic partners, could become obsolete prior to it being widely adopted.\nIn addition, our competitive position depends in part on our ability to offer new DISH branded pay-TV subscribers and upgrade existing subscribers with more advanced equipment, such as receivers with DVR and HD technology and by otherwise making additional infrastructure investments, such as those related to our information technology and call centers. We may also be at a competitive disadvantage in developing and introducing complex new products and services for our DISH branded pay-TV services because of the substantial costs we may incur in making these products or services available across our installed base of subscribers. Furthermore, the continued demand for HD programming continues to require investments in additional satellite capacity. We may not be able to pass on to our subscribers the entire cost of these upgrades and infrastructure investments.\nNew technologies could also create new competitors for us. For instance, we face increasing consumer demand for the delivery of digital video services via the Internet, including providing our Sling TV services and what we refer to as \u201cDISH Anywhere.\u201d We expect to continue to face increased threats from companies who use the Internet to deliver digital video services as the speed and quality of broadband and wireless networks continues to improve.\nTechnological innovation is important to our success and depends, to a significant degree, on the work of technically skilled employees. We rely on EchoStar to design, develop and manufacture set-top boxes with advanced features and functionality and to provide the streaming delivery technology and infrastructure for our Sling TV services. If EchoStar is unable to attract and retain appropriately technically skilled employees, our competitive position could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, delays in the delivery of components or other unforeseen problems associated with our technology may occur that could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue, offer new products and services and remain competitive.\nIf our products and services, including without limitation our DISH branded and Sling TV branded products and services, are not competitive, our business could suffer and our financial performance could be negatively impacted. Our products and services may also experience quality problems, including outages and service slowdowns, from time to time. If the quality of our products and services do not meet our customers\u2019 expectations, then our business, and ultimately our reputation, could be negatively impacted.\nWe rely on a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key products or services to us such as information technology support, billing systems, and security access devices, and the inability of these key vendors to meet our needs could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nHistorically, we have contracted with and rely on a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key products or services to us such as information technology support, billing systems, and security access devices. If these vendors are unable to meet our needs because they fail to perform adequately, are no longer in business, are experiencing shortages or discontinue a certain product or service we need, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. While alternative sources for these products and services exist, we may not be able to develop these alternative sources quickly and cost-effectively, which could materially impair our ability to timely deliver our products to our subscribers or operate our business. Furthermore, our vendors may request changes in pricing, payment terms or other contractual obligations between the parties, which could cause us to make substantial additional investments.\nOur primary supplier of new set-top boxes, EchoStar, relies on a few suppliers and in some cases a single supplier, for many components of our new set-top boxes, and any reduction or interruption in supplies or significant increase in the price of supplies could have a negative impact on our business.\nEchoStar relies on a few suppliers and in some cases a single supplier, for many components of our new set-top boxes that we provide to subscribers in order to deliver our digital television services. Our ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on EchoStar\u2019s ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of quality materials, parts and components from suppliers. In the event of an interruption of supply or a significant price increase from these suppliers, EchoStar may not be able to diversify sources of supply in a timely manner, which could have a negative impact on our business. Further, due to increased demand for products, many electronic manufacturers are experiencing shortages for certain components. EchoStar has experienced in the past and may continue to experience shortages driven by raw material availability, manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, natural disasters, logistical delays and significant changes in the financial or business conditions of its suppliers that negatively impact our operations. Any such delays or constraints could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including, among other things, our gross new subscriber activations.\nOur programming signals are subject to theft, and we are vulnerable to other forms of fraud that could require us to make significant expenditures to remedy.\nIncreases in theft of our signal or our competitors\u2019 signals could, in addition to reducing gross new subscriber activations, also cause subscriber churn to increase. To combat signal theft and improve the security of our broadcast system, we use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called \u201csmart cards,\u201d or security chips in our receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content (\u201cSecurity Access Devices\u201d).\nOur signal encryption has been compromised in the past and may be compromised in the future even though we continue to respond with significant investment in security measures, such as Security Access Device replacement programs and updates in security software, that are intended to make signal theft more difficult. It has been our prior experience that security measures may only be effective for short periods of time or not at all and that we remain susceptible to additional signal theft. We expect that future replacements of these Security Access Devices will be necessary to keep our system secure. We cannot ensure that we will be successful in reducing or controlling theft of our programming content and we may incur additional costs in the future if our system\u2019s security is compromised.\nWe are also vulnerable to other forms of fraud. While we are addressing certain fraud through a number of actions, including terminating independent retailers that we believe violated our business rules, there can be no assurance that we will not continue to experience fraud which could impact our gross new subscriber activations and subscriber churn. Economic weakness may create greater incentive for signal theft, piracy and other forms of fraud, which could lead to higher subscriber churn and reduced revenue.\nWe depend on independent third parties to solicit orders for our services that represent a significant percentage of our total gross new subscriber activations.\nWhile we offer products and services through direct sales channels, a significant percentage of our total gross new subscriber activations are generated through independent third parties such as small satellite retailers, direct marketing groups, local and regional consumer electronics stores, nationwide retailers, and telecommunications companies. Most of our independent retailers are not exclusive to us and some of our independent retailers may favor our competitors\u2019 products and services over ours based on the relative financial arrangements associated with marketing our products and services and those of our competitors. Furthermore, most of these independent retailers are significantly smaller than we are and may be more susceptible to economic weaknesses that make it more difficult for them to operate profitably. Because our independent retailers receive most of their incentive value at activation and not over an extended period of time, our interests may not always be aligned with our independent retailers. It may be difficult to better align our interests with our independent retailers because of their capital and liquidity constraints. Loss of these relationships could have an adverse effect on our subscriber base and certain of our other key operating metrics because we may not be able to develop comparable alternative distribution channels.\nWe have limited satellite capacity and failures or reduced capacity could adversely affect our DISH branded pay-TV business.\nOperation of our DISH branded pay-TV service requires that we have adequate satellite transmission capacity for the programming we offer. Moreover, current competitive conditions require that we continue to expand our offering of new programming. While we generally have had in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming, our backup capacity is limited. We lease substantially all of our satellite capacity from third parties, including the vast majority of our transponder capacity from EchoStar, and we do not carry commercial insurance on any of the satellites that we lease from them.\nOur ability to earn revenue from our DISH branded pay-TV service depends on the usefulness of our owned and leased satellites, each of which has a limited useful life. A number of factors affect the useful lives of the satellites, including, among other things, the quality of their construction, the durability of their component parts, the ability to continue to maintain proper orbit and control over the satellite\u2019s functions, the efficiency of the launch vehicle used, and the remaining on-board fuel following orbit insertion. Generally, the minimum design life of each of our satellites ranges from 12 to 15 years. We can provide no assurance, however, as to the actual useful lives of any of these satellites. Our operating results could be adversely affected if the useful life of any of our owned or leased satellites were significantly shorter than the minimum design life.\nIn the event of a failure or loss of any of our owned or leased satellites, we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other owned or leased satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such a failure could result in a prolonged loss of critical programming or a significant delay in our plans to expand programming as necessary to remain competitive. A relocation would require FCC approval and, among other things, may require a showing to the FCC that the replacement satellite would not cause additional interference compared to the failed or lost satellite. We cannot be certain that we could obtain such FCC approval. If we choose to use a satellite in this manner, this use could adversely affect our ability to satisfy certain operational conditions associated with our authorizations. Failure to satisfy those conditions could result in the loss of such authorizations, which would have an adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues.\nOur owned and leased satellites are subject to construction, launch, operational and environmental risks that could limit our ability to utilize these satellites.\nConstruction and launch risks. A key component of our business strategy is our ability to expand our offering of new programming and services for our DISH branded pay-TV business. To accomplish this goal, from time to time, new satellites need to be built and launched. Satellite construction and launch is subject to significant risks, including construction and launch delays, launch failure and incorrect orbital placement. Certain launch vehicles that may be used by us have either unproven track records or have experienced launch failures in the recent past. The risks of launch delay and failure are usually greater when the launch vehicle does not have a track record of previous successful flights. Launch failures result in significant delays in the deployment of satellites because of the need both to construct replacement satellites, which can take more than three years, and to obtain other launch opportunities. Significant construction or launch delays could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues. If we were unable to obtain launch insurance, or obtain launch insurance at rates we deem commercially reasonable, and a significant launch failure were to occur, it could impact our ability to fund future satellite procurement and launch opportunities.\nIn addition, the occurrence of future launch failures for other operators may delay the deployment of our satellites and materially and adversely affect our ability to insure the launch of our satellites at commercially reasonable premiums, if at all. See further information under the caption \u201cWe generally do not carry commercial launch or in-orbit insurance on any of the satellites that we use, other than certain satellites leased from third parties, and could face significant impairment charges if any of our owned satellites fail\u201d below.\nOperational risks. Satellites are subject to significant operational risks while in orbit. These risks include malfunctions, commonly referred to as anomalies that have occurred in our satellites and the satellites of other operators as a result of various factors, such as manufacturing defects, problems with the power systems or control systems of the satellites and general failures resulting from operating satellites in the harsh environment of space.\nAlthough we work closely with the satellite manufacturers to determine and eliminate the cause of anomalies in new satellites and provide for redundancies of many critical components in the satellites, we may experience anomalies in the future, whether of the types described above or arising from the failure of other systems or components.\nAny single anomaly or series of anomalies could materially and adversely affect our operations and revenues and our relationship with current customers, as well as our ability to attract new customers for our Pay-TV services. In particular, future anomalies may result in the loss of individual transponders on a satellite, a group of transponders on that satellite or the entire satellite, depending on the nature of the anomaly. Anomalies may also reduce the expected useful life of a satellite, thereby reducing the channels that could be offered using that satellite, or create additional expenses due to the need to provide replacement or back-up satellites. See disclosures relating to satellite anomalies set forth under Note 8 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nEnvironmental risks. Meteoroid events pose a potential threat to all in-orbit satellites. The probability that meteoroids will damage those satellites increases significantly when the Earth passes through the particulate stream left behind by comets. Occasionally, increased solar activity also poses a potential threat to all in-orbit satellites.\nSome decommissioned satellites are in uncontrolled orbits that pass through the geostationary belt at various points, and present hazards to operational satellites, including our satellites. We may be required to perform maneuvers to avoid collisions and these maneuvers may prove unsuccessful or could reduce the useful life of the satellite through the expenditure of fuel to perform these maneuvers. The loss, damage or destruction of any of our satellites as a result of an electrostatic storm, collision with space debris, malfunction or other event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe generally do not carry commercial launch or in-orbit insurance on any of the satellites that we use, other than certain satellites leased from third parties, and could face significant impairment charges if any of our owned satellites fail.\nGenerally, we do not carry commercial launch or in-orbit insurance on any of the satellites we use, other than certain satellites leased from third parties, and generally do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of launch or in-orbit failures because we believe that the cost of insurance premiums is uneconomical relative to the risk of such failures. We lease substantially all of our satellite capacity from third parties, including the vast majority of our transponder capacity from EchoStar, and we do not carry commercial insurance on any of the satellites we lease from them. While we generally have had in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming, our backup capacity is limited. In the event of a failure or loss of any of our owned or leased satellites, we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other owned or leased satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite. If one or more of our owned in-orbit satellites fail, we could be required to record significant impairment charges.\nWe may have potential conflicts of interest with EchoStar due to our common ownership and management.\nQuestions relating to conflicts of interest may arise between EchoStar and us in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships. Areas in which conflicts of interest between EchoStar and us could arise include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nCross officerships, directorships and stock ownership. We have certain overlap in directors and executive officers with EchoStar. These individuals may have actual or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting each company. Our Board of Directors and executive officers include persons who are members of the Board of Directors of EchoStar, including Charles W. Ergen, who serves as the Chairman of EchoStar and our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The executive officers and the members of our Board of Directors who overlap with EchoStar have fiduciary duties to EchoStar\u2019s shareholders. For example, there is the potential for a conflict of interest when we or EchoStar look at acquisitions and other business opportunities that may be suitable for both companies. In addition, certain of our directors and officers own EchoStar stock and options to purchase EchoStar stock. Mr. Ergen owns approximately 30.4% of EchoStar\u2019s total equity securities (assuming conversion of all Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock) and beneficially owns approximately 39.1% of EchoStar\u2019s total equity securities (assuming conversion of only the Class B Common Stock held by Mr. Ergen into Class A Common Stock). Under either a beneficial or equity calculation method, Mr. Ergen controls approximately 51.6% of the voting power of EchoStar. Mr. Ergen\u2019s ownership of EchoStar excludes 20,883,001 shares of its Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion of shares of its Class B Common Stock currently held by certain trusts established by Mr. Ergen for the benefit of his family. These trusts own approximately 22.5% of EchoStar\u2019s total equity securities (assuming conversion of all Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock) and beneficially own approximately 31.7% of EchoStar\u2019s total equity securities (assuming conversion of only the Class B Common Stock held by such trusts into Class A Common Stock). Under either a beneficial or equity calculation method, these trusts possess approximately 40.0% of EchoStar\u2019s total voting power. These ownership interests could create actual, apparent or potential conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and EchoStar. Furthermore, Charles W. Ergen, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is employed by both us and EchoStar. In addition, as a result of the Satellite and Tracking Stock Transaction discussed in Note 19 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we own shares of a series of preferred tracking stock issued by EchoStar and shares of a series of preferred tracking stock issued by Hughes Satellite Systems Corporation (\u201cHSSC\u201d), a subsidiary of EchoStar (collectively, the \u201cTracking Stock\u201d). The Tracking Stock generally tracks the residential retail satellite broadband business of Hughes Network Systems, LLC (\u201cHNS\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSSC, including without limitation the operations, assets and liabilities attributed to the Hughes residential retail satellite broadband business (collectively, the \u201cHughes Retail Group\u201d). The shares of the Tracking Stock issued to us represent an aggregate 80% economic interest in the Hughes Retail Group. Although our investment in the Tracking Stock represents an aggregate 80% economic interest in the Hughes Retail Group, we have no operational control or significant influence over the Hughes Retail Group business, and currently there is no public market for the Tracking Stock. Further, effective July 1, 2012, we and EchoStar formed Sling TV Holding L.L.C. (\u201cSling TV Holding,\u201d formerly known as DISH Digital Holding L.L.C.), which was owned two-thirds by us and one-third by EchoStar. Sling TV Holding was formed to develop and commercialize certain advanced technologies. Effective August 1, 2014, EchoStar and Sling TV Holding entered into an Exchange Agreement pursuant to which, among other things, Sling TV Holding distributed certain assets to EchoStar and EchoStar reduced its interest in Sling TV Holding to a ten percent non-voting interest. We now have a ninety percent equity interest and a 100% voting interest in Sling TV Holding. During 2015, we launched our Sling domestic and Sling Latino services. See Note 19 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\u00b7\nIntercompany agreements with EchoStar. In connection with and following the Spin-off, we and EchoStar have entered into certain agreements pursuant to which we obtain certain products, services and rights from EchoStar, EchoStar obtains certain products, services and rights from us, and we and EchoStar have indemnified each other against certain liabilities arising from our respective businesses. See Note 19 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our Related Party Transactions with EchoStar. The terms of certain of these agreements were established while EchoStar was a wholly-owned subsidiary of us and were not the result of arm\u2019s length negotiations. The allocation of assets, liabilities, rights, indemnifications and other obligations between EchoStar and us under the separation and other intercompany agreements we entered into with EchoStar, in connection with the Spin-off, may have been different if agreed to by two unaffiliated parties. Had these agreements been negotiated with unaffiliated third parties, their terms may have been more favorable, or less favorable, to us. In addition, conflicts could arise between us and EchoStar in the interpretation or any extension or renegotiation of these existing agreements.\n\u00b7\nAdditional intercompany transactions. EchoStar and its subsidiaries have and will continue to enter into transactions with us and our subsidiaries. Although the terms of any such transactions will be established based upon negotiations between EchoStar and us and, when appropriate, subject to the approval of a committee of the non-interlocking directors or in certain instances non-interlocking management, there can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to us or our subsidiaries or affiliates as may otherwise be obtained between unaffiliated parties.\n\u00b7\nBusiness opportunities. We have historically retained, and in the future may acquire, interests in various companies that have subsidiaries or controlled affiliates that own or operate domestic or foreign services that may compete with services offered by EchoStar. We may also compete with EchoStar when we participate in auctions for spectrum or orbital slots for our satellites. In addition, EchoStar may in the future use its satellites, uplink and transmission assets to compete directly against us in the subscription television business.\nWe may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts, and, even if we do so, the resolution may be less favorable to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party.\nOther than certain arrangements with EchoStar that we entered into in connection with Sling TV Holding, which, subject to certain exceptions, limit EchoStar\u2019s and our ability to operate an IPTV service other than operated by Sling TV Holding, we do not have agreements with EchoStar that would prevent either company from competing with the other.\nWe rely on key personnel and the loss of their services may negatively affect our business.\nWe believe that our future success will depend to a significant extent upon the performance of Charles W. Ergen, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and certain other executives. The loss of Mr. Ergen or of certain other key executives could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although all of our executives have executed agreements limiting their ability to work for or consult with competitors if they leave us, we do not have employment agreements with any of them. Mr. Ergen also serves as the Chairman of EchoStar. To the extent our officers are performing services for EchoStar, this may divert their time and attention away from our business and may therefore adversely affect our business.\nAcquisition and Capital Structure Risks\nWe have made substantial investments to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and other related assets. In addition, we have made substantial non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities related to AWS-3 wireless spectrum licenses.\nDISH Network Spectrum\nWe have invested over $5.0 billion since 2008 to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and related assets.\n700 MHz Licenses. In 2008, we paid $712 million to acquire certain 700 MHz wireless spectrum licenses, which were granted to us by the FCC in February 2009. At the time they were granted, these licenses were subject to certain interim and final build-out requirements. On October 29, 2013, the FCC issued an order approving a voluntary industry solution to resolve certain interoperability issues affecting the lower 700 MHz spectrum band (the \u201cInteroperability Solution Order\u201d), which requires us to reduce power emissions on our 700 MHz licenses. As part of the Interoperability Solution Order, the FCC, among other things, approved our request to modify the original interim and final build-out requirements associated with our 700 MHz licenses so that by March 2017, we must provide signal coverage and offer service to at least 40% of our total E Block population (the \u201cModified 700 MHz Interim Build-Out Requirement\u201d). The FCC also approved our request to modify the 700 MHz Final Build-Out Requirement so that by March 2021, we must provide signal coverage and offer service to at least 70% of the population in each of our E Block license areas (the \u201cModified 700 MHz Final Build-Out Requirement\u201d). While the modifications to our 700 MHz licenses provide us additional time to complete the build-out requirements, the reduction in power emissions could have an adverse impact on our ability to fully utilize our 700 MHz licenses. If we fail to meet the Modified 700 MHz Interim Build-Out Requirement, the Modified 700 MHz Final Build-Out Requirement may be accelerated by one year, from March 2021 to March 2020, and we could face the reduction of license area(s). If we fail to meet the Modified 700 MHz Final Build-Out Requirement, our authorization may terminate for the geographic portion of each license in which we are not providing service.\nAWS-4 Licenses. On March 2, 2012, the FCC approved the transfer of 40 MHz of wireless spectrum licenses held by DBSD North America and TerreStar to us. On March 9, 2012, we completed the DBSD Transaction and the TerreStar Transaction, pursuant to which we acquired, among other things, certain satellite assets and wireless spectrum licenses held by DBSD North America and TerreStar. The total consideration to acquire the DBSD North America and TerreStar assets was approximately $2.860 billion.\nOn February 15, 2013, the FCC issued an order, which became effective on March 7, 2013, modifying our licenses to expand our terrestrial operating authority with AWS-4 authority. That order imposed certain limitations on the use of a portion of this spectrum, including interference protections for other spectrum users and power and emission limits that we presently believe could render 5 MHz of our uplink spectrum (2000-2005 MHz) effectively unusable for terrestrial services and limit our ability to fully utilize the remaining 15 MHz of our uplink spectrum (2005-2020 MHz) for terrestrial services. These limitations could, among other things, impact the ongoing development of technical standards associated with our wireless business, and may have a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize our AWS-4 licenses. That order also mandated certain interim and final build-out requirements for the licenses. By March 2017, we must provide terrestrial signal coverage and offer terrestrial service to at least 40% of the aggregate population represented by all of the areas covered by the licenses (the \u201cAWS-4 Interim Build-Out Requirement\u201d). By March 2020, we were required to provide terrestrial signal coverage and offer terrestrial service to at least 70% of the population in each area covered by an individual license (the \u201cAWS-4 Final Build-Out Requirement\u201d).\nOn December 20, 2013, the FCC issued a further order that, among other things, extended the AWS-4 Final Build-Out Requirement by one year to March 2021 (the \u201cModified AWS-4 Final Build-Out Requirement\u201d). If we fail to meet the AWS-4 Interim Build-Out Requirement, the Modified AWS-4 Final Build-Out Requirement may be accelerated by one year, from March 2021 to March 2020. If we fail to meet the Modified AWS-4 Final Build-Out Requirement, our terrestrial authorization for each license area in which we fail to meet the requirement may terminate. The FCC\u2019s December 20, 2013 order also conditionally waived certain FCC rules for our AWS-4 licenses to allow us to repurpose all 20 MHz of our uplink spectrum (2000-2020 MHz) for downlink (the \u201cAWS-4 Downlink Waiver\u201d). If we fail to notify the FCC that we intend to use our uplink spectrum for downlink by June 20, 2016, the AWS-4 Downlink Waiver will terminate, and the Modified AWS-4 Final Build-Out Requirement will revert back to the AWS-4 Final Build-Out Requirement.\nH Block Licenses. On April 29, 2014, the FCC issued an order granting our application to acquire all 176 wireless spectrum licenses in the H Block auction. We paid approximately $1.672 billion to acquire these H Block licenses, including clearance costs associated with the lower H Block spectrum. The H Block licenses are subject to certain interim and final build-out requirements. By April 2018, we must provide reliable signal coverage and offer service to at least 40% of the population in each area covered by an individual H Block license (the \u201cH Block Interim Build-Out Requirement\u201d). By April 2024, we must provide reliable signal coverage and offer service to at least 75% of the population in each area covered by an individual H Block license (the \u201cH Block Final Build-Out Requirement\u201d). If we fail to meet the H Block Interim Build-Out Requirement, the H Block license term and the H Block Final Build-Out Requirement may be accelerated by two years (from April 2024 to April 2022) for each H Block license area in which we fail to meet the requirement. If we fail to meet the H Block Final Build-Out Requirement, our authorization for each H Block license area in which we fail to meet the requirement may terminate. The FCC has adopted rules for the H Block spectrum band that is adjacent to our AWS-4 licenses. Depending on the outcome of the standard-setting process for the H Block and our ultimate decision regarding the AWS-4 Downlink Waiver, the rules that the FCC adopted for the H Block could further impact 15 MHz of our AWS-4 uplink spectrum (2005-2020 MHz), which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize the AWS-4 licenses.\nCommercialization of Our Wireless Spectrum Licenses and Related Assets. We have made substantial investments to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and related assets. We will need to make significant additional investments or partner with others to, among other things, commercialize, build-out, and integrate these licenses and related assets, and any additional acquired licenses and related assets; and comply with regulations applicable to such licenses. Depending on the nature and scope of such commercialization, build-out, integration efforts, and regulatory compliance, any such investments or partnerships could vary significantly. We may also determine that additional wireless spectrum licenses may be required to commercialize our wireless business and to compete with other wireless service providers. For example, on February 10, 2016, we filed an application with the FCC to potentially participate as a bidder in the upcoming Auction 1000. Auction 1000 is scheduled to begin on March 29, 2016. The FCC determined that bidding in Auction 1000 will be \u201canonymous,\u201d which means that prior to and during the course of the auction, the FCC will not make public any information about a specific applicant\u2019s upfront deposits or its bids. In addition, FCC rules restrict information that bidders may disclose about their participation in Auction 1000. We may need to raise significant additional capital in the future to fund the efforts described above, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and implement a business model that will realize a return on these wireless spectrum licenses or that we will be able to profitably deploy the assets represented by these wireless spectrum licenses, which may affect the carrying amount of these assets and our future financial condition or results of operations.\nDISH Network Non-Controlling Investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities Related to AWS-3 Wireless Spectrum Licenses\nThrough our wholly-owned subsidiaries American II and American III, we have made over $10.0 billion in certain non-controlling investments in Northstar Spectrum, the parent company of Northstar Wireless, and in SNR HoldCo, the parent company of SNR Wireless, respectively. Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless each filed applications with the FCC to participate in Auction 97 (the \u201cAWS-3 Auction\u201d) for the purpose of acquiring certain AWS-3 Licenses. Each of Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless applied to receive bidding credits of 25% as designated entities under applicable FCC rules. In February 2015, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries received a refund from the FCC of its $400 million upfront payment made in 2014 related to the AWS-3 Auction.\nNorthstar Wireless was the winning bidder for AWS-3 Licenses with gross winning bid amounts totaling approximately $7.845 billion, which after taking into account a 25% bidding credit, is approximately $5.884 billion. SNR Wireless was the winning bidder for AWS-3 Licenses with gross winning bid amounts totaling approximately $5.482 billion, which after taking into account a 25% bidding credit, is approximately $4.112 billion. In addition to the net winning bids, SNR Wireless made a bid withdrawal payment of approximately $8 million.\nOn August 18, 2015, the FCC released a Memorandum Opinion and Order, FCC 15-104 (the \u201cOrder\u201d) in which the FCC determined, among other things, that DISH Network has a controlling interest in, and is an affiliate of, Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless, and therefore DISH Network\u2019s revenues should be attributed to them, which in turn makes Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless ineligible to receive the 25% bidding credits (approximately $1.961 billion for Northstar Wireless and $1.370 billion for SNR Wireless) (each a \u201cBidding Credit Amount\u201d and collectively the \u201cBidding Credit Amounts\u201d). Each of Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless has filed a notice of appeal and petition for review of the Order with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, challenging, among other things, the FCC\u2019s determination that they are ineligible to receive the Bidding Credit Amounts. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the timing or outcome of these proceedings. An adverse ruling against Northstar Wireless or SNR Wireless in these proceedings could potentially result in fines and/or revocation of the Northstar Licenses or SNR Licenses, respectively.\nOn October 1, 2015, DISH Network, American II, American III, Northstar Wireless, SNR Wireless, and certain other entities holding certain interests in Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless, entered into a series of arrangements with respect to the AWS-3 Licenses, as further described below.\nLetters Exchanged between Northstar Wireless and the FCC Wireless Bureau. As outlined in letters exchanged between Northstar Wireless and the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau of the FCC (the \u201cFCC Wireless Bureau\u201d), Northstar Wireless paid the gross winning bid amounts for 261 AWS-3 Licenses (the \u201cNorthstar Licenses\u201d) totaling approximately $5.619 billion through the application of funds already on deposit with the FCC. Northstar Wireless also notified the FCC that it would not be paying the gross winning bid amounts for 84 AWS-3 Licenses totaling approximately $2.226 billion.\nAs a result of the nonpayment of those gross winning bid amounts, the FCC retained those licenses and Northstar Wireless owed the FCC an additional interim payment of approximately $334 million (the \u201cNorthstar Interim Payment\u201d), which is equal to 15% of $2.226 billion. The Northstar Interim Payment is recorded in \u201cFCC auction expense\u201d on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2015. Northstar Wireless immediately satisfied the Northstar Interim Payment through the application of funds already on deposit with the FCC and an additional loan from American II of approximately $69 million. As a result, the FCC will not deem Northstar Wireless to be a \u201ccurrent defaulter\u201d under applicable FCC rules.\nIn addition, the FCC Wireless Bureau acknowledged that Northstar Wireless\u2019 nonpayment of those gross winning bid amounts does not constitute action involving gross misconduct, misrepresentation or bad faith. Therefore, the FCC concluded that such nonpayment will not affect the eligibility of Northstar Wireless, its investors (including DISH Network) or their respective affiliates to participate in future spectrum auctions (including Auction 1000 and any re-auction of the AWS-3 Licenses retained by the FCC). At this time, DISH Network (through itself, a subsidiary or another entity in which it may hold a direct or indirect interest) expects to participate in any re-auction of those AWS-3 Licenses.\nIf the winning bids from re-auction or other award of the AWS-3 Licenses retained by the FCC are greater than or equal to the winning bids of Northstar Wireless, no additional amounts will be owed to the FCC. However, if those winning bids are less than the winning bids of Northstar Wireless, then Northstar Wireless will be responsible for the difference less any overpayment of the Northstar Interim Payment (which will be recalculated as 15% of the winning bids from re-auction or other award) (the \u201cNorthstar Re-Auction Payment\u201d). For example, if the winning bids in a re-auction are $1, the Northstar Re-Auction Payment would be approximately $1.892 billion, which is calculated as the difference between $2.226 billion (the Northstar winning bid amounts) and $1 (the winning bids from re-auction) less the resulting $334 million overpayment of the Northstar Interim Payment. As discussed above, at this time, DISH Network (through itself, a subsidiary or another entity in which it may hold a direct or indirect interest) expects to participate in any re-auction. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the timing or outcome of any re-auction or the amount of any Northstar Re-Auction Payment.\nAmendment to Northstar Wireless Credit Agreement. On October 1, 2015, American II, Northstar Wireless and Northstar Spectrum amended the First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated October 13, 2014, by and among American II, as Lender, Northstar Wireless, as Borrower, and Northstar Spectrum, as Guarantor (as amended, the \u201cNorthstar Credit Agreement\u201d), to provide, among other things, that: (i) the Northstar Interim Payment and any Northstar Re-Auction Payment will be made by American II directly to the FCC and will be deemed as loans under the Northstar Credit Agreement; (ii) the FCC is a third-party beneficiary with respect to American II\u2019s obligation to pay the Northstar Interim Payment and any Northstar Re-Auction Payment; (iii) in the event that the winning bids from re-auction or other award of the AWS-3 Licenses retained by the FCC are less than the winning bids of Northstar Wireless, the purchaser, assignee or transferee of any AWS-3 Licenses from Northstar Wireless is obligated to pay its pro-rata share of the difference (and Northstar Wireless remains jointly and severally liable for such pro-rata share); and (iv) during the period between the due date for the payments guaranteed under the FCC Northstar Guaranty (as discussed below) and the date such guaranteed payments are paid, Northstar Wireless\u2019 payment obligations to American II under the Northstar Credit Agreement will be subordinated to such guaranteed payments.\nDISH Network Guaranty in Favor of the FCC for Certain Northstar Wireless Obligations. On October 1, 2015, DISH Network entered into a guaranty in favor of the FCC (the \u201cFCC Northstar Guaranty\u201d) with respect to the Northstar Interim Payment (which was satisfied on October 1, 2015) and any Northstar Re-Auction Payment. The FCC Northstar Guaranty provides, among other things, that during the period between the due date for the payments guaranteed under the FCC Northstar Guaranty and the date such guaranteed payments are paid: (i) Northstar Wireless\u2019 payment obligations to American II under the Northstar Credit Agreement will be subordinated to such guaranteed payments; and (ii) DISH Network or American II will withhold exercising certain rights as a creditor of Northstar Wireless.\nLetters Exchanged between SNR Wireless and the FCC Wireless Bureau. As outlined in letters exchanged between SNR Wireless and the FCC Wireless Bureau, SNR Wireless paid the gross winning bid amounts for 244 AWS-3 Licenses (the \u201cSNR Licenses\u201d) totaling approximately $4.271 billion through the application of funds already on deposit with the FCC and a portion of an additional loan from American III in an aggregate amount of approximately $344 million (which included an additional bid withdrawal payment of approximately $3 million). SNR Wireless also notified the FCC that it would not be paying the gross winning bid amounts for 113 AWS-3 Licenses totaling approximately $1.211 billion.\nAs a result of the nonpayment of those gross winning bid amounts, the FCC retained those licenses and SNR Wireless owed the FCC an additional interim payment of approximately $182 million (the \u201cSNR Interim Payment\u201d), which is equal to 15% of $1.211 billion. The SNR Interim Payment is recorded in \u201cFCC auction expense\u201d on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2015. SNR Wireless immediately satisfied the SNR Interim Payment through a portion of an additional loan from American III in an aggregate amount of approximately $344 million. As a result, the FCC will not deem SNR Wireless to be a \u201ccurrent defaulter\u201d under applicable FCC rules.\nIn addition, the FCC Wireless Bureau acknowledged that SNR Wireless\u2019 nonpayment of those gross winning bid amounts does not constitute action involving gross misconduct, misrepresentation or bad faith. Therefore, the FCC concluded that such nonpayment will not affect the eligibility of SNR Wireless, its investors (including DISH Network) or their respective affiliates to participate in future spectrum auctions (including Auction 1000 and any re-auction of the AWS-3 Licenses retained by the FCC). At this time, DISH Network (through itself, a subsidiary or another entity in which it may hold a direct or indirect interest) expects to participate in any re-auction of those AWS-3 Licenses.\nIf the winning bids from re-auction or other award of the AWS-3 Licenses retained by the FCC are greater than or equal to the winning bids of SNR Wireless, no additional amounts will be owed to the FCC. However, if those winning bids are less than the winning bids of SNR Wireless, then SNR Wireless will be responsible for the difference less any overpayment of the SNR Interim Payment (which will be recalculated as 15% of the winning bids from re-auction or other award) (the \u201cSNR Re-Auction Payment\u201d). For example, if the winning bids in a re-auction are $1, the SNR Re-Auction Payment would be approximately $1.029 billion, which is calculated as the difference between $1.211 billion (the SNR winning bid amounts) and $1 (the winning bids from re-auction) less the resulting $182 million overpayment of the SNR Interim Payment. As discussed above, at this time, DISH Network (through itself, a subsidiary or another entity in which it may hold a direct or indirect interest) expects to participate in any re-auction. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the timing or outcome of any re-auction or the amount of any SNR Re-Auction Payment.\nAmendment to SNR Wireless Credit Agreement. On October 1, 2015, American III, SNR Wireless and SNR HoldCo amended the First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated October 13, 2014, by and among American III, as Lender, SNR Wireless, as Borrower, and SNR HoldCo, as Guarantor (as amended, the \u201cSNR Credit Agreement\u201d), to provide, among other things, that: (i) the SNR Interim Payment and any SNR Re-Auction Payment will be made by American III directly to the FCC and will be deemed as loans under the SNR Credit Agreement; (ii) the FCC is a third-party beneficiary with respect to American III\u2019s obligation to pay the SNR Interim Payment and any SNR Re-Auction Payment; (iii) in the event that the winning bids from re-auction or other award of the AWS-3 Licenses retained by the FCC are less than the winning bids of SNR Wireless, the purchaser, assignee or transferee of any AWS-3 Licenses from SNR Wireless is obligated to pay its pro-rata share of the difference (and SNR Wireless remains jointly and severally liable for such pro-rata share); and (iv) during the period between the due date for the payments guaranteed under the FCC SNR Guaranty (as discussed below) and the date such guaranteed payments are paid, SNR Wireless\u2019 payment obligations to American III under the SNR Credit Agreement will be subordinated to such guaranteed payments.\nDISH Network Guaranty in Favor of the FCC for Certain SNR Wireless Obligations. On October 1, 2015, DISH Network entered into a guaranty in favor of the FCC (the \u201cFCC SNR Guaranty,\u201d) with respect to the SNR Interim Payment (which was satisfied on October 1, 2015) and any SNR Re-Auction Payment. The FCC SNR Guaranty provides, among other things, that during the period between the due date for the payments guaranteed under the FCC SNR Guaranty and the date such guaranteed payments are paid: (i) SNR Wireless\u2019 payment obligations to American III under the SNR Credit Agreement will be subordinated to such guaranteed payments; and (ii) DISH Network or American III will withhold exercising certain rights as a creditor of SNR Wireless.\nNorthstar Wireless is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northstar Spectrum. Through American II, we own an 85% non-controlling interest in Northstar Spectrum. Northstar Manager, LLC (\u201cNorthstar Manager\u201d) owns a 15% controlling interest in, and is the sole manager of, Northstar Spectrum. Northstar Spectrum is governed by a limited liability company agreement by and between American II and Northstar Manager (the \u201cNorthstar Spectrum LLC Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Northstar Spectrum LLC Agreement, American II and Northstar Manager made pro-rata equity contributions in Northstar Spectrum. As of October 1, 2015, the total equity contributions from American II and Northstar Manager to Northstar Spectrum were approximately $750 million and $133 million, respectively. As of October 1, 2015, the total loans from American II to Northstar Wireless under the Northstar Credit Agreement for payments to the FCC related to the Northstar Licenses were approximately $5.070 billion.\nSNR Wireless is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SNR HoldCo. Through American III, we own an 85% non-controlling interest in SNR HoldCo. SNR Wireless Management, LLC (\u201cSNR Management\u201d) owns a 15% controlling interest in, and is the sole manager of, SNR HoldCo. SNR HoldCo is governed by a limited liability company agreement by and between American III and SNR Management (the \u201cSNR HoldCo LLC Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the SNR HoldCo LLC Agreement, American III and SNR Management made pro-rata equity contributions in SNR HoldCo. As of October 1, 2015, the total equity contributions from American III and SNR Management to SNR HoldCo were approximately $524 million and $93 million, respectively. As of October 1, 2015, the total loans from American III to SNR Wireless under the SNR Credit Agreement for payments to the FCC related to the SNR Licenses were approximately $3.847 billion.\nAfter Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless satisfied their respective payments to the FCC on October 1, 2015 for the Northstar Licenses and the SNR Licenses, and the Northstar Interim Payment and the SNR Interim Payment (which included an additional bid withdrawal payment), our total non-controlling debt and equity investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities for payments to the FCC related to the AWS-3 Licenses were approximately $10.191 billion. Under the applicable accounting guidance in ASC 810, Northstar Spectrum and SNR HoldCo are considered variable interest entities and, based on the characteristics of the structure of these entities and in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, we have consolidated these entities into our financial statements beginning in the fourth quarter 2014. See Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nOn October 27, 2015, the FCC granted the Northstar Licenses to Northstar Wireless and the SNR Licenses to SNR Wireless, respectively, which are recorded in \u201cFCC authorizations\u201d on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The AWS-3 Licenses are subject to certain interim and final build-out requirements. By October 2021, Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless must provide reliable signal coverage and offer service to at least 40% of the population in each area covered by an individual AWS-3 License (the \u201cAWS-3 Interim Build-Out Requirement\u201d). By October 2027, Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless must provide reliable signal coverage and offer service to at least 75% of the population in each area covered by an individual AWS-3 License (the \u201cAWS-3 Final Build-Out Requirement\u201d). If Northstar Wireless or SNR Wireless fails to meet the AWS-3 Interim Build-Out Requirement, the AWS-3 License term and the AWS-3 Final Build-Out Requirement may be accelerated by two years (from October 2027 to October 2025) for each AWS-3 License area in which it fails to meet the requirement. If Northstar Wireless or SNR Wireless fails to meet the AWS-3 Final Build-Out Requirement, its authorization for each AWS-3 License area in which it fails to meet the requirement may terminate.\nWe may need to make significant additional loans to the Northstar Entities and to the SNR Entities, or they may need to partner with others, so that the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities may commercialize, build-out and integrate the Northstar Licenses and the SNR Licenses, and comply with regulations applicable to the Northstar Licenses and the SNR Licenses. Depending upon the nature and scope of such commercialization, build-out, integration efforts, and regulatory compliance, any such loans or partnerships could vary significantly. We may need to raise significant additional capital in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, to make further investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain a profitable return on our non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities. See \u201cWe face certain risks related to our non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition\u201d below for more information.\nImpairment of Assets\nFurthermore, the fair values of wireless spectrum licenses and related assets may vary significantly in the future. In particular, valuation swings could occur if:\n\u00b7\nconsolidation in the wireless industry allows or requires wireless carriers to sell significant portions of their wireless spectrum holdings, which could in turn reduce the value of our spectrum holdings;\n\u00b7\na sale of spectrum by one or more wireless providers occurs;\n\u00b7\nthe FCC pursues certain policies designed to increase the number of wireless spectrum licenses available in each of our markets; or\n\u00b7\nthe FCC conducts additional wireless spectrum auctions.\nIf the fair value of our wireless spectrum licenses were to decline significantly, the value of these licenses could be subject to impairment charges. We assess potential impairments to our indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or more often if indicators of impairment arise to determine whether there is evidence that indicate an impairment condition may exist.\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires that a long-lived asset be reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset might not be recoverable. It was determined that the T1 and D1 satellites met this criteria and therefore in the fourth quarter 2015 we tested the T1 satellite and D1 satellite and related ground equipment for impairment. We have concluded that the T1 satellite\u2019s fair value exceeded its carrying amount and no impairment was necessary. In addition, we have concluded that the carrying amount of the D1 satellite and related ground equipment exceeded their fair value determined under the cost approach. To arrive at fair value utilizing the cost approach, a replacement cost for the satellite was determined, which was then reduced for, among other things, depreciation and obsolescence. As a result of this assessment, we wrote down the net book value of the D1 satellite from $150 million to $55 million and the net book value of the related ground equipment from $28 million to zero and recorded an impairment charge of $123 million in \u201cImpairment of long-lived assets\u201d on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the net book value for T1 and D1 was $299 million and $55 million, respectively.\nWe face certain risks related to our non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition to the risks described in \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors - We have made substantial investments to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and other related assets. In addition, we have made substantial non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities related to AWS-3 wireless spectrum licenses\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we face certain other risks related to our non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities, including, among others, the risks described below. Any of the following risks, among others, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOn October 27, 2015, the FCC granted the Northstar Licenses to Northstar Wireless and the SNR Licenses to SNR Wireless, respectively. We do not own or control the Northstar Licenses or the SNR Licenses nor do we control the Northstar Entities or the SNR Entities. We do not have a right to require Northstar Manager or SNR Management to sell their respective ownership interests in Northstar Spectrum and SNR Holdco to us. Northstar Manager, as the sole manager of Northstar Spectrum, and SNR Management, as the sole manager of SNR Holdco, will have the exclusive right and power to manage, operate and control Northstar Spectrum and SNR Holdco, respectively, subject to certain limited protective provisions for the benefit of American II and American III, respectively. Northstar Manager and SNR Management will have the ability, but not the obligation, to require Northstar Spectrum and SNR Holdco, respectively, to purchase Northstar Manager\u2019s and SNR Management\u2019s ownership interests in those respective entities after the fifth anniversary of the grant date of the Northstar Licenses and the SNR Licenses (and in certain circumstances prior to the fifth anniversary of the grant date of the Northstar Licenses and the SNR Licenses). Thus, we cannot be certain that the Northstar Licenses or the SNR Licenses will be developed in a manner fully consistent with our current or future business plans.\nEach of Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless applied to receive bidding credits of 25% as designated entities under applicable FCC rules. The FCC implemented rules and policies governing the designated entity program that are intended to ensure that qualifying designated entities are not controlled by operators or investors that do not meet certain qualification tests. Qualification is also subject to challenge in qui tam lawsuits filed by private parties alleging that participants have defrauded the government in which the person bringing the suit may share in any recovery by the government. Furthermore, litigation surrounding designated entity structures, increased regulatory scrutiny or third party or government lawsuits with respect to our non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities could result in fines, and in certain cases, license revocation and/or criminal penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOn August 18, 2015, the FCC released the Order in which the FCC determined, among other things, that DISH Network has a controlling interest in, and is an affiliate of, Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless, and therefore DISH Network\u2019s revenues should be attributed to them, which in turn makes Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless ineligible to receive the Bidding Credit Amounts (approximately $1.961 billion for Northstar Wireless and $1.370 billion for SNR Wireless). Each of Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless has filed a notice of appeal and petition for review of the Order with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, challenging, among other things, the FCC\u2019s determination that they are ineligible to receive the Bidding Credit Amounts. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the timing or outcome of these proceedings. An adverse ruling against Northstar Wireless or SNR Wireless in these proceedings could potentially result in fines and/or revocation of the Northstar Licenses or SNR Licenses, respectively. See \u201cWe have made substantial investments to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and other related assets. In addition, we have made substantial non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities related to AWS-3 wireless spectrum licenses\u201d above for further information.\nWe may need to make significant additional loans to the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities, or they may need to partner with others, so that the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities may commercialize, build-out and integrate the Northstar Licenses and the SNR Licenses, and comply with regulations applicable to the Northstar Licenses and the SNR Licenses. Depending upon the nature and scope of such commercialization, build-out, integration efforts, and regulatory compliance, any such loans or partnerships could vary significantly. We may need to raise significant additional capital in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, to make further investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain a profitable return on our non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities.\nTo the extent that we commercialize our wireless spectrum licenses, we will face certain risks entering and competing in the wireless services industry and operating a wireless services business.\nWe have made substantial investments to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and related assets. We will need to make significant additional investments or partner with others to, among other things, commercialize, build-out, and integrate these licenses and related assets, and any additional acquired licenses and related assets; and comply with regulations applicable to such licenses. Depending on the nature and scope of such commercialization, build-out, integration efforts, and regulatory compliance, any such investments or partnerships could vary significantly. We may also determine that additional wireless spectrum licenses may be required to commercialize our wireless business and to compete with other wireless service providers. For example, on February 10, 2016, we filed an application with the FCC to potentially participate as a bidder in the upcoming Auction 1000. Auction 1000 is scheduled to begin on March 29, 2016. The FCC determined that bidding in Auction 1000 will be \u201canonymous,\u201d which means that prior to and during the course of the auction, the FCC will not make public any information about a specific applicant\u2019s upfront deposits or its bids. In addition, FCC rules restrict information that bidders may disclose about their participation in Auction 1000. We may need to raise significant additional capital in the future to fund the efforts described above, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and implement a business model that will realize a return on these wireless spectrum licenses or that we will be able to profitably deploy the assets represented by these wireless spectrum licenses, which may affect the carrying amount of these assets and our future financial condition or results of operations.\nTo the extent we commercialize our wireless spectrum licenses and enter the wireless services industry, a wireless services business presents certain risks. Any of the following risks, among others, may have a material adverse effect on our future business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u00b7\nThe wireless services industry is competitive. We have limited experience in the wireless services industry, which is a competitive industry, with increasing customer demands for data services that require increasing capital resources to maintain a robust network. The wireless services industry has incumbent and established competitors such as Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile USA Inc. (\u201cT-Mobile\u201d) and Sprint Corporation (\u201cSprint\u201d), with substantial market share. Some of these companies have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us, and have existing cost and operational advantages that we lack. Market saturation is expected to continue to cause the wireless services industry\u2019s customer growth rate to moderate in comparison to historical growth rates, leading to increased competition for customers. As the industry matures, competitors increasingly must seek to attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from each other\u2019s existing subscriber bases rather than from first-time purchasers of wireless services. Furthermore, the cost of attracting a new customer is generally higher than the cost associated with retaining an existing customer. In addition, we may face increasing competition from wireless telecommunications providers who offer mobile video offerings. Wireless mobile video offerings will likely become more prevalent in the marketplace as wireless telecommunications providers expand the fourth generation of wireless communications. In July 2015, AT&T completed its acquisition of DirecTV, our direct competitor and the largest satellite TV provider in the U.S. As a result of this acquisition, DirecTV, among other things, has increased access to capital, access to AT&T\u2019s nationwide platform for wireless mobile video, and the ability to more seamlessly bundle its video services with AT&T\u2019s broadband Internet access and wireless services. The combined company may be able to, among other things, pressure third-party content owners and programmers to withhold online rights from us; utilize its increased leverage over third-party content owners and programmers to reduce the price it pays for programming at the expense of other MVPDs, including us; thwart our entry into the wireless market, by, among other things, refusing to enter into data roaming agreements with us; foreclose or degrade our online video offerings at various points in the broadband pipe; and impose data caps on consumers who access our online video offerings.\n\u00b7\nOur ability to compete effectively would be dependent on a number of factors. Our ability to compete effectively would depend on, among other things, our network quality, capacity and coverage; the pricing of our products and services; the quality of customer service; our development of new and enhanced products and services; the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels; our ability to predict and adapt to future changes in technologies and changes in consumer demands; and capital resources. It would also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry, including, among others, new technologies and business models, products and services that may be introduced by competitors, changes in consumer preferences, the demand for services, demographic trends, economic conditions, and discount pricing and other strategies that may be implemented by competitors. It may be difficult for us to differentiate our products and services from other competitors in the industry, which may limit our ability to attract customers. Our success also may depend on our ability to access and deploy adequate spectrum, deploy new technologies and offer attractive services to customers. For example, we may not be able to obtain and offer certain technologies or features that are subject to competitor patents or other exclusive arrangements.\n\u00b7\nWe would depend on third parties to provide us with infrastructure and products and services. We would depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with infrastructure, equipment and services, such as switch and network equipment, handsets and other devices and equipment that we would need in order to operate a wireless services business and provide products and services to our customers. For example, handset and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components, such as chipsets, used in their devices. If these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or services on a timely basis or fail to meet performance expectations, we may be unable to provide products and services as and when expected by our customers. Any difficulties experienced with these suppliers and vendors could result in additional expense and/or delays in introducing our wireless services. Our efforts would involve significant expense and require strategic management decisions on, and timely implementation of, equipment choices, network deployment and management, and service offerings. In addition, these suppliers and vendors may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we would depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement.\n\u00b7\nWireless services and our wireless spectrum licenses are subject to government regulation. Wireless services and our wireless spectrum licenses are subject to regulation by the FCC and other federal, state and local, as well as international, governmental authorities. These governmental authorities could adopt regulations or take other actions that would adversely affect our business prospects, making it more difficult and/or expensive to commercialize our wireless spectrum licenses. The licensing, construction, operation, sale and interconnection arrangements of wireless telecommunications systems are regulated by the FCC and, depending on the jurisdiction, other federal and international, state and local regulatory agencies. In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensees, the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how the services may be offered, and resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands. The FCC grants wireless licenses for terms of generally ten years that are subject to renewal or revocation. There can be no assurances that our wireless spectrum licenses will be renewed or that we will be able to obtain additional licenses. Failure to comply with FCC requirements in a given license area could result in revocation of the license for that license area. For further information related to our wireless spectrum licenses, including build-out requirements, see other Risk Factors above.\nWe may pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions to complement or expand our business that may not be successful, and we may lose up to the entire value of our investment in these acquisitions and transactions.\nOur future success may depend on opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement, enhance or expand our current businesses or products or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. To pursue this strategy successfully, we must identify attractive acquisition or investment opportunities and successfully complete transactions, some of which may be large and complex. We may not be able to identify or complete attractive acquisition or investment opportunities due to, among other things, the intense competition for these transactions. If we are not able to identify and complete such acquisition or investment opportunities, our future results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to obtain in the anticipated timeframe, or at all, any regulatory approvals required to complete proposed acquisitions and other strategic transactions. Furthermore, the conditions imposed for obtaining any necessary approvals could delay the completion of such transactions for a significant period of time or prevent them from occurring at all. We may not be able to complete such transactions and such transactions, if executed, pose significant risks and could have a negative effect on our operations. Any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7\nthe diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our existing businesses to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired or combined business or joint venture;\n\u00b7\npossible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process;\n\u00b7\na high degree of risk inherent in these transactions, which could become substantial over time, and higher exposure to significant financial losses if the underlying ventures are not successful;\n\u00b7\nour possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the transaction; and\n\u00b7\nthe risks associated with complying with regulations applicable to the acquired business, which may cause us to incur substantial expenses.\nIn addition, we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage our newly acquired operations or employees. We may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, and this may lead to operational inefficiencies. In addition, the integration process may strain our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures.\nNew acquisitions, joint ventures and other transactions may require the commitment of significant capital that would otherwise be directed to investments in our existing business. To pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions, we may need to raise additional capital in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nIn addition to committing capital to complete the acquisitions, substantial capital may be required to operate the acquired businesses following their acquisition. These acquisitions may result in significant financial losses if the intended objectives of the transactions are not achieved. Some of the businesses acquired by us have experienced significant operating and financial challenges in their recent history, which in some cases resulted in these businesses commencing bankruptcy proceedings prior to our acquisition. We may acquire similar businesses in the future. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully address the challenges and risks encountered by these businesses following their acquisition. If we are unable to successfully address these challenges and risks, our business, financial condition and/or results of operations may suffer.\nWe may need additional capital, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, to continue investing in our business and to finance acquisitions and other strategic transactions.\nWe may need to raise significant additional capital in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, to among other things, continue investing in our business, construct and launch new satellites, and to pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions. Weakness in the equity markets could make it difficult for us to raise equity financing without incurring substantial dilution to our existing shareholders. Adverse changes in the credit markets, including rising interest rates, could increase our borrowing costs and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, economic weakness or weak results of operations may limit our ability to generate sufficient internal cash to fund investments, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other strategic transactions, as well as to fund ongoing operations and service our debt. Furthermore, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by their credit metrics. A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. A severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could also affect our access to financing. As a result, these conditions make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities because we may not have access to funding sources necessary for us to pursue organic and strategic business development opportunities.\nSee \u201cWe have made substantial investments to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and other related assets. In addition, we have made substantial non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities related to AWS-3 wireless spectrum licenses\u201d above for more information.\nFrom time to time a portion of our investment portfolio may be invested in securities that have limited liquidity and may not be immediately accessible to support our financing needs, including investments in public companies that are highly speculative and have experienced and continue to experience volatility.\nFrom time to time a portion of our investment portfolio may be invested in strategic investments, and as a result, a portion of our portfolio may have restricted liquidity. If the credit ratings of these securities deteriorate or there is a lack of liquidity in the marketplace, we may be required to record impairment charges. Moreover, the uncertainty of domestic and global financial markets can greatly affect the volatility and value of our marketable investment securities. In addition, a portion of our investment portfolio may include strategic and financial investments in debt and equity securities of public companies that are highly speculative and experience volatility. Typically, these investments are concentrated in a small number of companies. The fair value of these investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses. The concentration of these investments as a percentage of our overall investment portfolio fluctuates from time to time based on, among other things, the size of our investment portfolio and our ability to liquidate these investments. In addition, because our portfolio may be concentrated in a limited number of companies, we may experience a significant loss if any of these companies, among other things, defaults on its obligations, performs poorly, does not generate adequate cash flow to fund its operations, is unable to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms, or at all, or files for bankruptcy, or if the sectors in which these companies operate experience a market downturn. To the extent we require access to funds, we may need to sell these securities under unfavorable market conditions, record impairment charges and fall short of our financing needs.\nWe have substantial debt outstanding and may incur additional debt.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our total long-term debt and capital lease obligations, including the debt of our subsidiaries, was $13.756 billion. On February 1, 2016, we redeemed the $1.5 billion principal balance of our 7 1/8% Senior Notes due 2016 using a substantial portion of our available cash and investment securities on hand. Following repayment of our 7 1/8% Senior Notes due 2016, our total long-term debt and capital lease obligations, including the debt of our subsidiaries, was approximately $12.3 billion.\nOur debt levels could have significant consequences, including:\n\u00b7\nmaking it more difficult to satisfy our obligations;\n\u00b7\na dilutive effect on our outstanding equity capital or future earnings;\n\u00b7\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions, including changes in interest rates;\n\u00b7\nrequiring us to devote a substantial portion of our cash to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of cash available for other purposes. As a result, we would have limited financial and operating flexibility in responding to changing economic and competitive conditions;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to raise additional debt because it may be more difficult for us to obtain debt financing on attractive terms; and\n\u00b7\nplacing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. The terms of the indentures relating to our senior notes permit us to incur additional debt. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks we now face could intensify.\nIt may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our shareholders, because of our ownership structure.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company that a shareholder may consider favorable. These provisions include the following:\n\u00b7\na capital structure with multiple classes of common stock: a Class A that entitles the holders to one vote per share, a Class B that entitles the holders to ten votes per share, a Class C that entitles the holders to one vote per share, except upon a change in control of our company in which case the holders of Class C are entitled to ten votes per share;\n\u00b7\na provision that authorizes the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our Board of Directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u00b7\na provision limiting who may call special meetings of shareholders; and\n\u00b7\na provision establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at shareholder meetings.\nIn addition, pursuant to our certificate of incorporation we have a significant amount of authorized and unissued stock which would allow our Board of Directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of its management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us.\nWe are controlled by one principal stockholder who is also our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nCharles W. Ergen, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, owns approximately 44.8% of our total equity securities (assuming conversion of all Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock) and beneficially owns approximately 48.4% of our total equity securities (assuming conversion of only the Class B Common Stock held by Mr. Ergen into Class A Common Stock). Under either a beneficial or equity calculation method, Mr. Ergen controls approximately 78.5% of the total voting power. Mr. Ergen\u2019s beneficial ownership of shares of Class A Common Stock excludes 33,790,620 shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion of shares of Class B Common Stock currently held by certain trusts established by Mr. Ergen for the benefit of his family. These trusts own approximately 7.3% of our total equity securities (assuming conversion of all Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock) and beneficially own approximately 13.1% of our total equity securities (assuming conversion of only the Class B Common Stock held by such trusts into Class A Common Stock). Under either a beneficial or equity calculation method, these trusts possess approximately 13.0% of the total voting power. Through his voting power, Mr. Ergen has the ability to elect a majority of our directors and to control all other matters requiring the approval of our stockholders. As a result, DISH Network is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d as defined in the Nasdaq listing rules and is, therefore, not subject to Nasdaq requirements that would otherwise require us to have: (i) a majority of independent directors; (ii) a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors; (iii) compensation of our executive officers determined by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors; and (iv) director nominees selected, or recommended for the Board\u2019s selection, either by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors. Mr. Ergen is also the principal stockholder and Chairman of EchoStar.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nA ruling in the Do Not Call litigation requiring us to pay substantial civil penalties and/or damages and/or enjoining us, whether acting directly or indirectly through authorized telemarketers or independent third-party retailers, from certain activities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nOn March 25, 2009, our wholly-owned subsidiary DISH Network L.L.C. was sued in a civil action by the United States Attorney General and several states in the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois, alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule, as well as analogous state statutes and state consumer protection laws. The plaintiffs allege that we, directly and through certain independent third-party retailers and their affiliates, committed certain telemarketing violations. On December 23, 2013, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment, which indicated for the first time that the state plaintiffs were seeking civil penalties and damages of approximately $270 million and that the federal plaintiff was seeking an unspecified amount of civil penalties (which could substantially exceed the civil penalties and damages being sought by the state plaintiffs). The plaintiffs are also seeking injunctive relief that if granted would, among other things, enjoin DISH Network L.L.C., whether acting directly or indirectly through authorized telemarketers or independent third-party retailers, from placing any outbound telemarketing calls to market or promote its goods or services for five years, and enjoin DISH Network L.L.C. from accepting activations or sales from certain existing independent third-party retailers and from certain new independent third-party retailers, except under certain circumstances. We also filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking dismissal of all claims. On December 12, 2014, the Court issued its opinion with respect to the parties\u2019 summary judgment motions. The Court found that DISH Network L.L.C. is entitled to partial summary judgment with respect to one claim in the action. In addition, the Court found that the plaintiffs are entitled to partial summary judgment with respect to ten claims in the action, which includes, among other things, findings by the Court establishing DISH Network L.L.C.\u2019s liability for a substantial amount of the alleged outbound telemarketing calls by DISH Network L.L.C. and certain of its independent third-party retailers that were the subject of the plaintiffs\u2019 motion. The Court did not issue any injunctive relief and did not make any determination on civil penalties or damages, ruling instead that the scope of any injunctive relief and the amount of any civil penalties or damages are questions for trial. In pre-trial disclosures, the federal plaintiff indicated that it intends to seek up to $900 million in alleged civil penalties, and the state plaintiffs indicated that they now intend to seek $23.5 billion in alleged civil penalties and damages. The first phase of the bench trial took place January 19, 2016 through February 11, 2016. The Court will conduct a second phase of the bench trial in October 2016, which we anticipate will cover the plaintiffs\u2019 requested injunctive relief, as well as DISH Network L.L.C.\u2019s response to certain evidence presented by the plaintiffs in the first phase. A ruling requiring us to pay substantial civil penalties and/or damages and/or enjoining us, whether acting directly or indirectly through authorized telemarketers or independent third-party retailers, from the activities described above could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nOur business depends on certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others.\nWe rely on our patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other parties, to use our technologies, conduct our operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question or from the continuation of our business as currently conducted, which could require us to change our business practices or limit our ability to compete effectively or could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from our business. We currently have a pending lawsuit with one major broadcast television network alleging, among other things, that the PrimeTime Anytime and AutoHop features of the Hopper set-top box infringe its copyrights. See Note 15 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. In the event a court ultimately determines that we infringe the asserted copyrights, we may be subject to, among other things, an injunction that could require us to materially modify or cease to offer these features. Moreover, because of the rapid pace of technological change, we rely on technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from these third parties on reasonable terms, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we work with third parties such as vendors, contractors and suppliers for the development and manufacture of components that are integrated into our products and services, and our products and services may contain technologies provided to us by these third parties or other third parties. We may have little or no ability to determine in advance whether any such technology infringes the intellectual property rights of others. Our vendors, contractors and suppliers may not be required to indemnify us if a claim of infringement is asserted against us, or they may be required to indemnify us only up to a maximum amount, above which we would be responsible for any further costs or damages. Legal challenges to these intellectual property rights may impair our ability to use the products, services and technologies that we need in order to operate our business and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are party to various lawsuits which, if adversely decided, could have a significant adverse impact on our business, particularly lawsuits regarding intellectual property.\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business, including among other things, disputes with programmers regarding fees. Many entities, including some of our competitors, have or may in the future obtain patents and other intellectual property rights that may cover or affect products or services related to those that we offer. In general, if a court determines that one or more of our products or services infringes on intellectual property held by others, we may be required to cease developing or marketing those products or services, to obtain licenses from the holders of the intellectual property at a material cost, or to redesign those products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing the intellectual property. If those intellectual property rights are held by a competitor, we may be unable to obtain the intellectual property at any price, which could adversely affect our competitive position. See further information under \u201cItem 1. Business - Patents and Other Intellectual Property\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may not be aware of all intellectual property rights that our services or the products used in connection with our services may potentially infringe. In addition, patent applications in the United States are confidential until the Patent and Trademark Office either publishes the application or issues a patent (whichever arises first). Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the extent to which our services or the products used in connection with our services may infringe claims contained in pending patent applications. Further, it is sometimes not possible to determine definitively whether a claim of infringement is valid.\nOur ability to distribute video content via the Internet, including our Sling TV services, involves regulatory risk.\nAs a result of recent updates to certain of our programming agreements which allow us to, among other things, deliver certain authenticated content via the Internet and/or deliver certain content through our Sling TV services, we are increasingly distributing video content to our subscribers via the Internet and through our Sling TV services. The ability to continue this strategy may depend in part on the FCC\u2019s success in implementing rules prohibiting paid prioritization and blocking, throttling and discrimination against our distribution of content over broadband networks. For more information, see \u201cItem 1. Business - Government Regulations - FCC Regulations Governing our DBS Operations - Net Neutrality\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in the Cable Act, and/or the rules of the FCC that implement the Cable Act, may limit our ability to access programming from cable-affiliated programmers at nondiscriminatory rates.\nWe purchase a large percentage of our programming from cable-affiliated programmers. Pursuant to the Cable Act, cable providers had been prohibited from entering into exclusive contracts with cable-affiliated programmers. The Cable Act directed that this prohibition expire after a certain period of time unless the FCC determined that the prohibition continued to be necessary. On October 5, 2012, the FCC allowed this prohibition to expire. While the FCC has issued a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking aimed at serving some of the same objectives as the prohibition, there can be no assurances that such protections will be adopted or be as effective as the prohibition if they are adopted. In the event this decision is reconsidered by the FCC or reviewed by a court of appeals, we cannot predict the timing or outcome of any subsequent FCC decision.\nAs a result of the expiration of this prohibition on exclusivity, we may be limited in our ability to obtain access at all, or on nondiscriminatory terms, to programming from programmers that are affiliated with cable system operators. In addition, any other changes in the Cable Act, and/or the FCC\u2019s rules that implement the Cable Act, that currently limit the ability of cable-affiliated programmers to discriminate against competing businesses such as ours, could adversely affect our ability to acquire cable-affiliated programming at all or to acquire programming on nondiscriminatory terms.\nFurthermore, the FCC had imposed program access conditions on certain cable companies as a result of mergers, consolidations or affiliations with programmers. The expiration of the exclusivity prohibition in the Cable Act triggered the termination of certain program access conditions that the FCC had imposed on Liberty. In July 2012, similar program access conditions that had applied to Time Warner Cable expired as previously scheduled. These developments may adversely affect our ability to obtain Liberty\u2019s and Time Warner Cable\u2019s programming, or to obtain it on nondiscriminatory terms. In the case of certain types of programming affiliated with Comcast through its control of NBCUniversal, the prohibition on exclusivity will still apply until January 2018. During that time, we have the right to subject the terms of access to NBCUniversal\u2019s programming to binding arbitration if we and the programmer cannot reach agreement on terms, subject to FCC review. There can be no assurance that this procedure will result in favorable terms for us.\nIn addition, affiliates of certain cable providers have denied us access to sports programming that they distribute to their cable systems terrestrially, rather than by satellite. The FCC has held that new denials of such service are unfair if they have the purpose or effect of significantly hindering us from providing programming to consumers. However, we cannot be certain that we can prevail in a complaint related to such programming and gain access to it. Our continuing failure to access such programming could materially and adversely affect our ability to compete in regions serviced by these cable providers.\nThe injunction against our retransmission of distant networks, which is currently waived, may be reinstated.\nPursuant to STELA, we obtained a waiver of a court injunction that previously prevented us from retransmitting certain distant network signals under a statutory copyright license. Because of that waiver, we may provide distant network signals to eligible subscribers. To qualify for that waiver, we are required to provide local service in all 210 local markets in the U.S. on an ongoing basis. This condition poses a significant strain on our capacity. Moreover, we may lose that waiver if we are found to have failed to provide local service in any of the 210 local markets. If we lose the waiver, the injunction could be reinstated. Furthermore, depending on the severity of the failure, we may also be subject to other sanctions, which may include, among other things, damages.\nWe are subject to significant regulatory oversight, and changes in applicable regulatory requirements, including any adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the Internet, could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations, particularly our DBS operations and our wireless spectrum licenses, are subject to significant government regulation and oversight, primarily by the FCC and, to a certain extent, by Congress, other federal agencies and foreign, state and local authorities. Depending upon the circumstances, noncompliance with legislation or regulations promulgated by these authorities could result in the limitations on, or suspension or revocation of, our licenses or registrations, the termination or loss of contracts or the imposition of contractual damages, civil fines or criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to video programming, satellite services, wireless telecommunications, broadband, the Internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business, including our Sling TV services. If we become subject to new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation that govern Internet network neutrality, for example, we may be required to incur additional expenses or alter our business model. The manner in which legislation governing Internet network neutrality may be interpreted and enforced cannot be precisely determined, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See regulatory disclosures under the caption \u201cItem 1. Business - Government Regulations\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nOur business depends on FCC licenses that can expire or be revoked or modified and applications for FCC licenses that may not be granted.\nIf the FCC were to cancel, revoke, suspend, restrict, significantly condition, or fail to renew any of our licenses or authorizations, or fail to grant our applications for FCC licenses that we may file from time to time, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Specifically, loss of a frequency authorization would reduce the amount of spectrum available to us, potentially reducing the amount of services available to our DISH branded pay-TV subscribers. The materiality of such a loss of authorizations would vary based upon, among other things, the location of the frequency used or the availability of replacement spectrum. In addition, Congress often considers and enacts legislation that affects us and FCC proceedings to implement the Communications Act and enforce its regulations are ongoing. We cannot predict the outcomes of these legislative or regulatory proceedings or their effect on our business.\nWe are subject to digital HD \u201ccarry-one, carry-all\u201d requirements that cause capacity constraints.\nTo provide any full-power local broadcast signal in any market, we are required to retransmit all qualifying broadcast signals in that market (\u201ccarry-one, carry-all\u201d), including the carriage of full-power broadcasters\u2019 HD signals in markets in which we elect to provide local channels in HD. The carriage of additional HD signals on our DISH branded pay-TV service could cause us to experience significant capacity constraints and prevent us from carrying additional popular national programs and/or carrying those national programs in HD.\nOur business, investor confidence in our financial results and stock price may be adversely affected if our internal controls are not effective.\nWe periodically evaluate and test our internal control over financial reporting to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015. If in the future we are unable to report that our internal control over financial reporting is effective (or if our auditors do not agree with our assessment of the effectiveness of, or are unable to express an opinion on, our internal control over financial reporting), investors, customers and business partners could lose confidence in the accuracy of our financial reports, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, investor confidence in our financial results may weaken, and our stock price may suffer.\nWe may face other risks described from time to time in periodic and current reports we file with the SEC.", "PERMNO": 81696, "SIC": 4841, "TIC": "DISH"}
