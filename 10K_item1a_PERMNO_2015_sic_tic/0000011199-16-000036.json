{"cik": "11199", "company": "BEMIS CO INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-19", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nThe following factors, as well as factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, or in other filings by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Other factors not presently known to us or that we presently believe are not material could also affect our business operations and financial results.\nRaw materials - Raw material cost increases or shortages could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs a manufacturer, our sales and profitability are dependent on the availability and cost of raw materials, which are subject to price fluctuations. Inflationary and other increases in the costs of raw materials have occurred in the past and are expected to recur, and our performance depends in part on our ability to reflect changes in costs in selling prices for our products. We have generally been successful in managing the impact of higher raw material costs by increasing selling prices through our contractual pass-through mechanisms with most of our customers. Natural disasters such as hurricanes, in addition to terrorist activity and government regulation of environmental emissions, may negatively impact the production or delivery capacity of our raw material suppliers in the chemical and paper industries. This could result in increased raw material costs or supply shortages, which may have a negative impact on our profitability if the cost increases are sustained sequentially over multiple periods or, in the case of a shortage, if we are unable to secure raw materials from alternative sources.\nKey customers - The loss of key customers or a significant reduction in sales to those customers could significantly reduce our revenues.\nOur customer base includes key (generally large) customers that are important to our success. The Company's response to continued and increased customer consolidations and marketplace competition may result in lower than expected net pricing of the Company products. Furthermore, if key customers experience financial pressure, they could request more favorable contractual terms, which could place additional pressure on our margins and cash flows. In addition, our success depends on our ability to respond timely to changes in customer product needs and market acceptance of our products. We must produce products that meet the quality, performance, and price expectations of our customers. Changes in customers\u2019 preferences for our products can also affect the demand for our products. Lower demand for our products could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nForeign operations - Conditions in foreign countries and changes in foreign currency exchange rates may significantly reduce our reported results of operations.\nWe have operations globally. In 2015, approximately 28 percent of our sales were generated by entities operating outside of the United States. Fluctuations in currencies can cause transaction and translation losses. In addition, our revenues and net income may be adversely affected by economic conditions, political situations, and changing laws and regulations in foreign countries, as to which we have no control.\nInterest rates - An increase in interest rates could reduce our reported results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2015, our variable rate borrowings approximated $967.2 million (which includes $400 million fixed rate notes that have been effectively converted to variable rate debt through the use of a fixed to variable rate interest rate swap). Fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and have an adverse impact on results of operations. Accordingly, increases in short-term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay. For each one percent increase in variable interest rates, our annual interest expense would increase by approximately $9.7 million on the $967.2 million of variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2015.\nAcquisitions and divestitures - We may not be able to successfully integrate businesses that we acquire or limit ongoing costs associated with the operations we divest.\nWe have made numerous acquisitions in the past and are regularly considering new acquisitions that we believe will provide meaningful opportunities to grow our business and improve performance in the future. Acquired businesses may not achieve the levels of revenue, profit, productivity, or otherwise perform as we expect. Acquisitions involve special risks, including, without limitation, the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies as well as difficulties in integrating acquired businesses. While we believe that our acquisitions will improve our competitiveness and future financial performance, we can give no assurance that acquisitions will be successful.\nWe also make strategic divestitures from time to time and we may agree to indemnify acquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses.\nInformation technology - A failure in our information technology systems could negatively affect our business.\nWe depend on information technology to record and process customers' orders, manufacture and ship products in a timely manner, and maintain the financial accuracy of our business records. We are in the process of implementing a global Enterprise Resource Planning (\"ERP\") system that will redesign and deploy new processes and a common information system across our plants over a period of several years. There can be no certainty that this system will deliver the expected benefits. The failure to achieve our goals may impact our ability to (1) process transactions accurately and efficiently and (2) remain in step with the changing needs of the trade, which could result in the loss of customers. In addition, the failure to either deliver the application on time, or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs, could lead to business disruption and loss of customers and revenue. Finally, failure or abandonment of any part of the ERP system could result in a write-off of part or all of the costs that have been capitalized on the project.\nOur information systems could also be penetrated by outside parties or misused by employees or other insiders intent on extracting information, corrupting information, or disrupting business processes. Such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets, which could result in the loss of customer confidence and business, and cause us to incur time and expense in remediation efforts.\nLitigation - Litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance.\nWe are, and in the future will become, involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business. As we expand our global footprint, we become exposed to more uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment. The timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain. Additionally, the possible outcomes of, or resolutions to, these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements, either of which could require substantial payments. See \u201cLegal Proceedings\" included in Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets - A significant write-down of goodwill and/or other intangible assets would have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net worth.\nWe review our goodwill balance for impairment at least once a year using the business valuation methods allowed in accordance with current accounting standards. These methods include the use of a weighted-average cost of capital to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows of our reporting units. Future changes in the cost of capital, expected cash flows, or other factors may cause our goodwill and/or other intangible assets to be impaired, resulting in a non-cash charge against results of operations to write down these assets for the amount of the impairment. In addition, if we make changes in our business strategy or if external conditions adversely affect our business operations, we may be required to record an impairment charge for goodwill or intangibles, which would lead to decreased assets and reduced net operating results. If a significant write down is required, the charge would have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net worth. We have identified the valuation of intangibles as a critical accounting estimate. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments-Intangible assets and goodwill\u201d included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPatents and proprietary technology - Our success is dependent on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products and to acquire and retain intellectual property rights.\nOur ability to develop and successfully market new products and to develop, acquire, and retain necessary intellectual property rights is essential to our continued success, but cannot reasonably be assured.\nFunded status of pension plans - Recognition of pension liabilities may cause a significant reduction in stockholders\u2019 equity.\nIn September 2013 the Company approved amendments related to certain defined benefit pension plans effective December 31, 2013. The amendments froze all further benefit accruals for all persons entitled to benefits under these plans as of December 31, 2013. As a result, final average pay formulas will not reflect future compensation increases or additional service after December 31, 2013. While the amendments reduced some risk related to future service costs, there is still risk associated with ongoing liability re-measurement and plan asset valuations. Current accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") require balance sheet recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans. If the fair value of our pension plans\u2019 assets at a future reporting date decreases or if the discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation (\"PBO\") as of that date decreases, we will be required to record the incremental change in the excess of PBO over the fair value of the assets as a reduction of stockholders\u2019 equity. The resulting non-cash after-tax charge would represent future expense and would be recorded directly as a decrease in the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income component of stockholders\u2019 equity. While we cannot estimate the future funded\nstatus of our pension liability with any certainty at this time, we believe that if the market value of assets or the discount rate used to calculate our pension liability materially decreases, the adjustment could significantly reduce our stockholders\u2019 equity. A significant reduction in stockholders\u2019 equity may impact our compliance with debt covenants or could cause a downgrade in our credit ratings that could also adversely impact our future cost and speed of borrowing and have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We have identified pension assumptions as a critical accounting estimate. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments-Pension costs\u201d and \u201c-Pension assumptions sensitivity analysis\u201d included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCredit rating - A downgrade in our credit rating could increase our borrowing costs and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to using cash provided by operations, we regularly issue commercial paper to meet our short-term liquidity needs. Our credit ratings are important to our ability to issue commercial paper at favorable rates of interest. A downgrade in our credit rating could increase the cost of borrowing by increasing the spread over prevailing market rates that we pay for our commercial paper or the fees associated with our bank credit facility.\nRestructuring activities - Our restructuring activities and cost saving initiatives may not achieve the results we anticipate.\nWe have undertaken and will continue to undertake restructuring activities and cost reduction initiatives to optimize our asset base, improve operating efficiencies and generate cost savings. We cannot be certain that we will be able to complete these initiatives as planned or that the estimated operating efficiencies or cost savings from such activities will be fully realized or maintained over time. In addition, we may not be successful in migrating production from one facility to another.\nImports and exports - We are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets.\nCertain of our products are subject to export controls and may be exported only with the required export license or through an export license exception. If we were to fail to comply with export licensing, customs regulations, economic sanctions and other laws, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines for the Company and incarceration for responsible employees and managers, and the possible loss of export or import privileges. In addition, if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.\nFurthermore, export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. While we train our employees to comply with these regulations, we cannot assure that a violation will not occur, whether knowingly or inadvertently. Any such shipment could have negative consequences including government investigations, penalties, fines, civil and criminal sanctions, and reputational harm. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations. Any limitation on our ability to export or sell our products could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 43772, "SIC": 2670, "TIC": "BMS"}
