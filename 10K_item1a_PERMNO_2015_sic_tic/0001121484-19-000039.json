{"cik": "1121484", "company": "OIL STATES INTERNATIONAL, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results.\nDemand for the majority of our products and services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by companies in the oil and natural gas industry. Lower oil and natural gas prices since 2014 have significantly reduced the demand for our products and services and the prices we are able to charge. This has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDemand for most of our products and services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by companies in the oil and natural gas industry. The significant decline in oil and natural gas prices during 2014 that continued in 2016 and 2017, before improving through the first nine months of 2018 caused a reduction in most of our customers\u2019 drilling, completion and other production activities and related spending on our products and services. The reduction in demand from our customers has resulted in an oversupply of many of the services and products we provide, and such oversupply has substantially reduced the prices we can charge our customers for many of our products and services. Although oil prices improved since the trough in 2016, these price improvements have not resulted in significant global improvements in the demand for our products and services or the prices we are able to charge. If oil prices remain persistently low or decline further, our customers\u2019 activity levels and spending, along with the prices we charge, could worsen. In addition, a continuation or worsening of these conditions may result in a material adverse impact on certain of our customers\u2019 liquidity and financial position, resulting in further spending reductions, delays in the collection of amounts owing to us and similar impacts. These conditions have, had and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and it is difficult to predict how long the current depressed commodity price environment will continue.\nAlthough conditions in our industry improved in 2018, particularly in the shale resource plays in the United States, crude prices again declined significantly beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018. Given the historical volatility of crude oil prices, there remains a degree of risk that prices could remain at current levels or deteriorate further due to increases in global inventory levels, increasing domestic crude oil production, U.S. and China trade tensions, sanctions or waivers on Iranian production, civil unrest in Libya, increasing price differentials between markets, slowing growth rates in China and other global regions, use of alternative fuels, improved vehicle fuel efficiency, a more sustained movement to electric vehicles and/or the potential for ongoing supply/demand imbalances. If oil prices remain low or decline further, we could encounter difficulties such as an inability to access needed capital on attractive terms or at all, the incurrence of asset impairment charges, the inability to meet financial ratios contained in our debt agreements, the need to reduce our capital spending and other similar impacts. For example, our reduced EBITDA during recent periods resulted in our inability to access the full borrowing capacity available under our Revolving Credit Facility as a result of the maximum leverage ratio covenant, which under our Amended Revolving Credit Facility, requires that our ratio of total net debt to consolidated EBITDA be no greater than 4.00 to 1.0 for fiscal quarters ending prior to December 31, 2018 and no greater than 3.75 to 1.0 thereafter. As more fully disclosed in Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the heading \"Liquidity, Capital Resources and Other Matters,\" we discuss our expectations regarding liquidity and covenant compliance for 2019.\nMany factors affect the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas and, therefore, influence product prices, including:\n\u2022\nthe level of drilling and completion activity;\n\u2022\nthe level of oil and natural gas production;\n\u2022\nthe levels of oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022\ndepletion rates;\n\u2022\nworldwide demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe expected cost of finding, developing and producing new reserves;\n\u2022\ndelays in major offshore and onshore oil and natural gas field development timetables;\n\u2022\nthe availability of attractive oil and natural gas field prospects that may be affected by governmental actions or environmental activists that may restrict development;\n\u2022\nthe availability of transportation infrastructure for oil and natural gas, refining capacity and shifts in end-customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas;\n\u2022\nglobal weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022\nworldwide economic activity including growth in developing countries;\n\u2022\nnational government political requirements, including the ability and willingness of OPEC to set and maintain production levels and prices for oil and government policies which could nationalize or expropriate oil and natural gas exploration, production, refining or transportation assets;\n\u2022\nshareholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to limit certain sources of funding for the energy sector or restrict the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe impact of armed hostilities involving one or more oil producing nations;\n\u2022\nrapid technological change and the timing and extent of development of energy sources, including liquefied natural gas or alternative fuels;\n\u2022\nenvironmental and other governmental laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign tax policies, including those regarding tariffs and duties.\nIn response to lower oil prices, many of our customers have reduced or delayed their capital spending, which reduced the demand for our products and services and exerted downward pressure on the prices paid for our products and services. Although some of our customers increased their 2018 capital expenditure budgets, these customers are still spending significantly less than their pre-2015 levels. Additionally, if oil prices remain at current levels or decline further, these customers may further reduce their spending levels. We expect that we will continue to encounter weakness in the demand for, and prices of, our products and services until commodity prices stabilize at higher levels and our customers\u2019 capital spending increases. Any prolonged reduction in the overall level of exploration and production activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and natural gas prices or otherwise, could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in many ways including by negatively affecting:\n\u2022\nour equipment utilization, revenues, cash flows and profitability;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional capital to finance our business and the cost of that capital; and\n\u2022\nour ability to attract and retain skilled personnel.\nGiven the cyclical nature of our business, a severe prolonged downturn could negatively affect the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets.\nAs of December 31, 2018, goodwill and other intangible assets represented 32% and 13%, respectively, of our total assets. We record goodwill when the consideration we pay in acquiring a business exceeds the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets of that business. We are required to periodically review the goodwill and other intangible assets of our applicable reporting units (Completion Services, Downhole Technologies and Offshore/Manufactured Products) for impairment in value and to recognize a non-cash charge against earnings causing a corresponding decrease in stockholders\u2019 equity if circumstances, some of which are beyond our control, indicate that the carrying amounts will not be recoverable. It is possible that we could recognize goodwill and other intangible assets impairment losses in the future if, among other factors:\n\u2022\nglobal economic and industry conditions deteriorate;\n\u2022\nthe outlook for future profits and cash flow for any of our reporting units deteriorate further as the result of many possible factors, including, but not limited to, increased or unanticipated competition, technology becoming obsolete, further reductions in customer capital spending plans, loss of key personnel, adverse legal or regulatory judgment(s), future operating losses at a reporting unit, downward forecast revisions, or restructuring plans;\n\u2022\ndomestic and/or foreign income tax rates increase, or regulations change;\n\u2022\ncosts of equity or debt capital increase;\n\u2022\nvaluations for comparable public companies or comparable acquisition valuations deteriorate; or\n\u2022\nour stock price experiences a sustained decline.\nLaws and regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase our costs of doing business and result in additional operating restrictions, delays or cancellations in the completion of oil and natural gas wells that may reduce demand for our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough we do not directly engage in hydraulic fracturing, a material portion of our Completion Services, Downhole Technologies and Offshore/Manufactured Products operations support many of our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers in such activities. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process for the completion of oil and natural gas wells in targeted subsurface formations with low permeability, such as shale formations, and involves the pressurized injection of water, sand or other proppants and chemical additives into rock formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production.\nHydraulic fracturing onshore in the United States is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions and similar agencies. However, the practice has become increasingly controversial in certain parts of the country, resulting in increased scrutiny and regulation, including by federal agencies.\nFor example, the EPA has asserted regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities under the SDWA involving the use of diesel fuels and published guidance covering such activities as well as published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to collect data on chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing under the Toxic Substances Control Act. Also, in 2016, the EPA published an efficient limit guideline final rule under the Clean Water Act prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. Additionally, in 2015, the federal Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\") published a final rule establishing new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands but the BLM rescinded the rule in December 2017; however, litigation was filed in federal court in January 2018 challenging the BLM\u2019s rescission of the 2015 rule and legal challenges remain pending. Also, from time to time, Congress has considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing in the United States and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. In addition to asserting regulatory authority, a number of federal entities have reviewed various environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. For example, in 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that \"water cycle\" activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances.\nAt the state level, some states have adopted and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose new or more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities, including states where we or our customers operate. States could elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the State of New York. Local governments may also seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place or manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular.\nIn the event that new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to use of the hydraulic fracturing process in the United States are adopted in areas where our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate, those customers could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with requirements relating to permitting, construction, financial assurance, monitoring, recordkeeping, and/or plugging and abandonment, as well as could experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of production or development activities, any of which could reduce demand for the products and services of each of our business segments and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nMoreover, non-governmental organizations may seek to restrict hydraulic fracturing. For example, certain interest groups in Colorado opposed to oil and natural gas development generally, and hydraulic fracturing in particular, have from time to time advanced various options for ballot initiatives that, if approved, would allow revisions to state statutes or the constitution in a manner that would make such exploration and production activities in the state more difficult or expensive in the future. In each of the November 2014, 2016 and 2018 general election cycles in Colorado, ballot initiatives have been pursued, with the 2018 initiative making the November 2018 ballot, seeking to increase setback distances between new oil and natural-gas development and specific occupied structures and/or certain environmentally sensitive or recreational areas that, if adopted, may have had significant adverse impacts on new oil and natural-gas development in the state. However, in each election cycle, the ballot initiative either did not secure a place on the general ballot or, as was the case in November 2018, was defeated. Similar initiatives may be pursed in Colorado and other states in the future.\nIn foreign countries outside of the United States, including provincial, regional, tribal or local jurisdictions therein where we conduct operations, there may exist similar governmental restrictions or controls on our customers\u2019 hydraulic fracturing activities, which, if such restrictions or controls exist or are adopted in the future, our customers may incur significant costs to comply with such requirements or may experience delays or curtailment in the permitting or pursuit of their operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe explosion of dangerous materials used in our business could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial conditions.\nOur Downhole Technologies business operations include the licensing, storage and handling of explosive materials. Despite our use of specialized facilities to store and handle dangerous materials and our employee training programs, the storage and handling of explosive materials could result in explosive incidents that temporarily shut down or otherwise disrupt our or our customers\u2019 operations or could cause restrictions, delays or cancellations in the delivery of our services. It is possible that such an explosion could result in death or significant injuries to employees and other persons. Material property damage to us, our customers and third parties arising from an explosion or resulting fire could also occur. Any explosion could expose us to adverse publicity and liability for damages or cause production restrictions, delays or cancellations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable requirements or the occurrence of an explosive incident may also result in the loss of our license to store and handle explosives, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions.\nFederal or state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to induced seismicity could result in operating restrictions or delays in the drilling and completion of oil and natural gas wells that may reduce demand for our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur oil and natural gas producing customers dispose of flowback water or certain other oilfield fluids gathered from oil and natural gas producing operations in accordance with permits issued by government authorities overseeing such disposal activities. While these permits are issued pursuant to existing laws and regulations, these legal requirements are subject to change based on concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such disposal activities. One such concern relates to seismic events near underground disposal wells used for the disposal by injection of flowback water or certain other oilfield fluids resulting from oil and natural gas activities. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. Developing research suggests that the link between seismic activity and wastewater disposal may vary by region and local geology. For example, in 2016, the United States Geological Survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity, including Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arkansas. In response to concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, Oklahoma has issued rules for wastewater disposal wells that imposed certain permitting and operating restrictions and reporting requirements on disposal wells in proximity to faults and also, from time to time, is developing and implementing plans directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations. The Texas Railroad Commission has adopted similar rules. In addition, another consequence of seismic events may be lawsuits alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. One or more of these developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells by our customers to dispose of flowback water and certain other oilfield fluids. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity also could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and natural gas activities utilizing injection wells for waste disposal. As a result, our customers may have to limit disposal well volumes, disposal rates or locations, or require our customers or third party disposal well operators that are used to dispose of customers\u2019 wastewater to shut down disposal wells, which developments could adversely affect our customers\u2019 business and result in a corresponding decrease in the need for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe do business in international jurisdictions which exposes us to unique risks.\nA portion of our revenue and net assets are attributable to operations in foreign countries. Risks associated with our operations in foreign areas include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nexpropriation, confiscation or nationalization of assets;\n\u2022\nrenegotiation or nullification of existing contracts;\n\u2022\nforeign exchange limitations;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations;\n\u2022\nforeign taxation;\n\u2022\nthe inability to repatriate earnings or capital in a tax efficient manner;\n\u2022\nchanging political conditions;\n\u2022\neconomic or trade sanctions;\n\u2022\nchanging foreign and domestic monetary and trade policies;\n\u2022\nchanges in trade activity;\n\u2022\nsocial, political, military, and economic situations in foreign areas where we do business, and the possibilities of war, other armed conflict or terrorist attacks; and\n\u2022\nregional economic downturns.\nAdditionally, in some jurisdictions we are subject to foreign governmental regulations favoring or requiring the awarding of contracts to local contractors, or requiring foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. These regulations may adversely affect our ability to compete in such jurisdictions.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\"), and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices and impact our business. Any failure to comply with the FCPA or other anti-bribery legislation could subject us to civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We could also face fines, sanctions, and other penalties from authorities in the relevant foreign jurisdictions, including prohibition of our participating in, or curtailment of, business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of assets. Additionally, we may have competitors who are not subject to the same ethics-related laws and regulations which provides them with a competitive advantage over us by securing business awards, licenses, or other preferential treatment, in those jurisdictions using methods that certain ethics-related laws and regulations prohibit us from using.\nThe regulatory regimes in some foreign countries may be substantially different than those in the United States, and may be unfamiliar to U.S. investors. Violations of foreign laws could result in monetary and criminal penalties against us or our subsidiaries and could damage our reputation and, therefore, our ability to do business.\nThe ultimate impact of recent changes to tariffs and duties imposed by the United States and other countries is uncertain. We use a variety of domestically produced and imported raw materials and component products, including steel, in the manufacture of our products. In 2018, the United States imposed tariffs on a variety of imported products, including steel and aluminum. In response to the U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum, the European Union and several other countries, including Canada and China, have threatened and/or imposed retaliatory tariffs. The effect of these new tariffs and the application and interpretation of existing trade agreements and customs, anti-dumping and countervailing duty regulations continues to evolve, and we continue to monitor these matters. If we encounter difficulty in procuring these raw materials and component products, or if the prices we have to pay for these products increase as a result of customs, anti-dumping and countervailing duty regulations or otherwise and we are unable to pass corresponding cost increases on to our customers, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, uncertainty with respect to potential costs in the drilling and completion of oil and gas wells could cause our customers to delay or cancel planned projects which, if this occurred, would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. See Note 13, \"Commitments and Contingencies.\"\nAdditional domestic and international deepwater drilling laws, regulations and other restrictions, delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration, development, oil spill-response and decommissioning plans and other offshore-related developments may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (\"BOEM\") and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (\"BSEE\"), each an agency of the U.S. Department of the Interior, have, over time, imposed more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements for new wells to be drilled in federal waters. Compliance with these more stringent regulatory requirements and with existing environmental and oil spill regulations, together with any uncertainties or inconsistencies in decisions and rulings by governmental agencies, delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits or exploration, development, oil spill-response and decommissioning plans and possible additional regulatory initiatives could result in difficult and more costly actions and adversely affect, delay or curtail new drilling and ongoing development efforts.\nAdditionally, these governmental agencies are continuing to evaluate and, as necessary, develop and implement new, more restrictive requirements that could result in additional costs, delays, restrictions or obligations with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and production operations conducted offshore. For example, in 2016, the BSEE published a final rule on well control that, among other things, imposes rigorous standards relating to the design, operation and maintenance of blowout preventers, real-time monitoring of deepwater and high temperature, high pressure drilling activities, and enhanced reporting requirements. Pursuant to President Trump\u2019s Executive Orders of March 2017 and April 2017 (\"Executive Orders\"), however, the BSEE initiated a review of the well control regulations to determine whether the rules are consistent with the stated policy of encouraging energy exploration and production, while ensuring that any such activity is safe and environmentally responsible. One consequence of this review is that in September 2018, the BSEE published final revisions to its regulations regarding offshore drilling safety equipment, which\nincludes the removal of the requirement for offshore operators to certify through an independent third party that their critical safety and pollution prevention equipment (e.g., subsea safety equipment, including blowout preventers) is operational and functioning as designed in the most extreme conditions. Another consequence of this BSEE review is that, in May 2018, the BSEE issued a proposed rule to revise its existing regulations for well control and blowout preventer systems that was bolstered under its 2016 final rule, but the May 2018 proposed rule has not been finalized.\nMoreover, in 2016, the BOEM issued a Notice to Lessees and Operators (\"NTL\") that would bolster supplemental bonding procedures for the decommissioning of offshore wells, platforms, pipelines, and other facilities by oil and natural gas exploration and production operators, some of whom are our customers, on the Outer Continental Shelf (\"OCS\"). However, since the BOEM\u2019s issuance of the NTL, the agency has delayed indefinitely beyond June 30, 2017, the implementation timeline of the NTL for most of those facilities so that BOEM could further assess this financial assurance program. This delay is expected to be temporary and following completion of its review, the BOEM may elect to retain the 2016 NTL in its current form or may make revisions thereto. Consequently, until the review is completed and the BOEM determines what additional financial assurance may be required of operators on the OCS, which additional assurance amounts could be significant, we are unable to assess the extent to which our customers on the OCS will be able to comply with any such assurance obligations. Significant increases in financial assurance could adversely affect the ability of our customers to operate on the OCS, which could reduce demand for our products and services to those customers. Also, in 2016, the BOEM published a proposed rule that would update existing air emissions requirements relating to offshore oil and natural gas activity on the OCS which would include a requirement to report and track pollutant emissions affecting human health and public welfare. However, pursuant to the Executive Orders, the BOEM has ceased rulemaking activities and is reviewing the continuing need for the proposed air quality rule.\nThese regulatory actions, or any new rules, regulations, or legal initiatives could delay or disrupt our customers\u2019 operations, increase the risk of expired leases due to the time required to develop new technology, result in increased supplemental bonding and costs and limit activities in certain areas, or cause our customers to incur penalties, fines, or shut-in production at one or more of their facilities or result in the suspension or cancellation of leases, any or all of which could reduce demand for our products and services. While the Trump Administration has generally indicated an interest in scaling back or rescinding regulations that inhibit the development of the U.S. oil and natural gas industry, it is difficult to predict the extent to which such policies will be implemented or the outcome of any litigation challenging such implementation.\nAlso, if material spill events were to occur in the future, the United States or other countries where such an event were to occur could elect to issue directives to temporarily cease drilling activities and, in any event, may from time to time issue further safety and environmental laws and regulations regarding offshore oil and natural gas exploration and development, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict with any certainty the full impact of any new laws, regulations or legal initiatives on our customers\u2019 drilling operations or on the cost or availability of insurance to cover the risks associated with such operations. The matters described above, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConsolidation of our customers and competitors may impact our results of operations.\nThe oil and gas industry has experienced periods of consolidation in the past. Industry consolidation may result in reduced capital spending by some of our customers, the acquisition of one or more of our primary customers or competitors or consolidated entities using size and purchasing power to seek pricing or other concessions, which may lead to decreased demand for our products and services. In addition, recent, ongoing and future mergers, combinations and consolidations in our industry could result in existing competitors increasing their market share and may result in stronger competitors. As a result, industry consolidation may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nExchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our U.S. reported results of operations and financial position.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we enter into purchase and sales commitments that are denominated in currencies that differ from the functional currency used by our operating subsidiaries. Currency exchange rate fluctuations can create volatility in our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows. Although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, these transactions, if entered into, will not eliminate that risk entirely. To the extent that we are unable to match revenues received in foreign currencies with expenses paid in the same currency, exchange rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows. Additionally, because our consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, if we generate net revenues or earnings in countries whose currency is not the U.S. dollar, the translation of such amounts into U.S. dollars can result in an increase or decrease in the amount of our net revenues and earnings depending upon exchange rate movements. As a result, a material decrease in the value of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may have a negative impact on our reported\nrevenues, net income, and cash flows. Any currency controls implemented by local monetary authorities in countries where we currently operate could also adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe results of the United Kingdom\u2019s referendum on withdrawal from the European Union including the subsequent exchange rate fluctuations and political and economic uncertainties may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.\nWe are a multinational company and are subject to the risks inherent in doing business in other countries, including the United Kingdom (the \"U.K.\"). In June 2016, a majority of voters in the U.K. elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national referendum (\"Brexit\"). The referendum was advisory, and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years after the government of the U.K. formally initiates a withdrawal process. Nevertheless, Brexit has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.K. and the European Union and other countries, including with respect to the laws and regulations that will apply as the U.K. determines which European Union derived laws to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal. The referendum has also given rise to calls for the governments of other European Union member states to consider withdrawal. These developments, or the perception that any of these developments may occur, could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and the jurisdictions in which we operate and may cause us to lose customers, suppliers and employees.\nThe impact from Brexit on our business and operations will depend on the outcome of tariff, tax treaty, trade, regulatory and other negotiations, as well as the impact of the withdrawal on macroeconomic growth and currency volatility, which are uncertain at this time. Any of these effects of Brexit could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nOur operations are significantly affected by numerous laws and regulations domestically at the federal, regional, state, tribal and local levels or by foreign governments regarding the discharge of substances into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. We could be exposed to liabilities for cleanup costs, natural resource damages, and other damages under these laws and regulations, with certain of these legal requirements imposing strict liability for such damages and costs, even though our conduct was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct resulting in such damage and costs were caused by prior operators or other third-parties.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations in the United States and in foreign countries are subject to change in the future, possibly resulting in more stringent legal requirements. If existing regulatory requirements or enforcement policies change or new regulatory or enforcement initiatives are developed and implemented in the future, we or our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers may be required to make significant, unanticipated capital and operating expenditures. Examples of recent regulations or other regulatory initiatives include the following:\n\u2022\nGround-Level Ozone Standards. In 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the CAA, lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (\"NAAQS\") for ground-level ozone from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion under both the primary and secondary standards to provide requisite protection of public health and welfare, respectively. In 2017 and 2018, the EPA issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone as either \"attainment/unclassifiable,\" \"unclassifiable\" or \"non-attainment.\" Additionally, in November 2018, the EPA issued final requirements that apply to state, local, and tribal air agencies for implementing the 2015 NAAQS for ground-level ozone. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our or our customers\u2019 equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our or our customers\u2019 capital expenditures and operating costs.\n\u2022\nEPA Review of Drilling Waste Classification. Drilling, fluids, produced water and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or natural gas, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under the RCRA and instead, are regulated under RCRA\u2019s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions. However, following the filing of a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by several non-governmental environmental groups against the EPA for the agency\u2019s failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations for oil and natural gas wastes, the EPA and the environmental groups entered into an agreement that was finalized in a consent decree issued by the District Court in December 2016. Under the decree, the EPA is required to propose no later than March 15, 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and natural gas wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. If the EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and natural gas waste regulations, the consent decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021.\n\u2022\nWaters of the United States. In 2015, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (\"Corps\") released a final rule outlining federal jurisdictional reach under the Clean Water Act over waters of the United States, including wetlands. Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, the EPA and the Corps agreed to reconsider the 2015 rule and, thereafter, the agencies have (i) published a proposed rule in July 2017 to rescind the 2015 rule and recodify the regulatory text that governed waters of the United States prior to promulgation of the 2015 rule, (ii) published a final rule in February 2018 adding a February 6, 2020 applicable date to the 2015 rule, and (iii) published a proposed rule in December 2018 re-defining the Clean Water Act's jurisdiction over waters of the United States for which the agencies will seek public comment. The 2015 and February 2018 final rules are being challenged by various factions in federal district court and implementation of the 2015 rule has been enjoined in twenty-eight states pending resolution of the various federal district court challenges. As a result of these legal developments, future implementation of the 2015 rule or a revised rule is uncertain at this time. To the extent that the 2015 rule or a revised rule expands the scope of the Clean Water Act\u2019s jurisdiction in areas where we or our customers conduct operations, we or our customers could incur increased costs and restrictions, delays or cancellations, which could reduce demand for our products and services.\nCompliance with these regulations and other regulatory initiatives, or any other new environmental laws and regulations could, among other things, require us or our customers to install new or modified emission controls on equipment or processes, incur longer permitting timelines, and incur significantly increased capital or operating expenditures, which costs may be significant. Additionally, one or more of these developments could reduce demand for our products and services. Moreover, any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations may result in governmental authorities taking actions against our business that could adversely impact our operations and financial condition, including the:\n\u2022\nissuance of administrative, civil, and/or criminal penalties;\n\u2022\ndenial or revocation of permits or other authorizations;\n\u2022\nreduction, delay or cessation in operations, including any development or expansion of projects; and\n\u2022\nperformance of site investigatory, remedial, or other corrective actions or the incurrence of capital expenditures.\nAn accidental release of pollutants into the environment may cause us to incur significant costs and liabilities.\nOur business activities present risks of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in our business as a result of our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons, because of air emissions and waste water discharges related to our operations, and due to historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Additionally, private parties, including the owners of properties upon which we perform services and facilities where our wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property or natural resource damages. Some environmental laws and regulations may impose strict liability, which means that in some situations we could be exposed to liability as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by prior operators or other third parties. Remedial costs and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws and costs associated with changes in environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance.\nClimate change laws and regulations restricting or regulating emissions of GHGs could result in increased operating and capital costs and reduced demand for our products and services.\nClimate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention in the United States and in foreign countries. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made internationally, domestically at the federal, regional and state levels, and by foreign governments to monitor and limit GHGs. These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources.\nIn the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level, to date. In the absence of federal GHG-limiting legislation, the EPA has determined that GHG emissions present a danger to public health and the environment and has adopted rules under authority of the CAA that, among other things, establish Potential for Significant Deterioration construction and Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that are also potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions, which reviews could require securing permits at covered facilities emitting GHGs and meeting \u201cbest available control technology\u201d standards for those GHG emissions. Additionally, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the United States, including, among others, onshore and offshore production facilities, which include certain of our producing customers\u2019 operations.\nFederal agencies also have begun directly regulating emissions of methane, a GHG, from oil and natural gas operations, and states, such as New Mexico, are considering additional local regulations. In 2016, the EPA published a final rule establishing new emissions standards for methane and additional standards for volatile organic compounds from certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas source category that will require the use of certain equipment specific emissions control practices. However, in 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay certain portions of the 2016 standards for two years but the rule has not been finalized. Rather, in February 2018, the EPA finalized amendments to certain requirements of the 2016 final rule and, in September 2018, the agency proposed additional amendments that included rescission or revision of certain requirements such as fugitive emission monitoring frequency. Furthermore, in 2016, the BLM published a final rule to reduce methane emissions by regulating venting, flaring, and leaking from oil and natural gas operations on federal and Indian lands. However, in September 2018, the BLM published a final rule that rescinds most of the requirements in the 2016 final rule and codifies the BLM's prior approach to venting and flaring. The rescission of the requirements in the 2016 final rule is being challenged in federal court. These rules, should they remain in effect, and any other new methane emission standards imposed on the oil and gas sector could result in increased costs to our and our customers\u2019 operations as well as result in delays or curtailment in such operations, which costs, delays or curtailment could adversely affect our business.\nAdditionally, in April 2016, the United States joined other countries in entering into a United Nations-sponsored non-binding agreement negotiated in Paris, France (the \"Paris Agreement\") for nations to limit their GHG emissions through individually-determined reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. However, in August 2017, the U.S. State Department informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, which provides for a four-year exit process beginning when the agreement took effect in November 2016. Notwithstanding any withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, the adoption and implementation of any international, federal or state legislation or regulations that require reporting of GHGs or otherwise restrict emissions of GHGs could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions imposed on us or our customers operations, adversely impact overall drilling activity in the areas in which we operate, reduce the demand for carbon-based fuels, and reduce the demand for our products and services. Any one or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, demand for our services, results of operations, and cash flows. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that oil and gas will continue to represent a major share of global energy use through 2040 and other studies by the private sector project continued growth in demand for the next two decades. However, recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energy-related assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production activities.\nThe Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and other laws intended to protect certain species of wildlife govern our and our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers\u2019 operations, which constraints could have an adverse impact on our ability to expand some of our existing operations or limit our customers\u2019 ability to develop new oil and natural gas wells.\nThe federal Endangered Species Act and comparable state laws were established to protect endangered and threatened species. Under the Endangered Species Act, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species' habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Oil and natural gas operations in our operating areas may be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife, which may limit our ability to operate in protected areas. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered and threatened species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures.\nMoreover, as a result of one or more settlements approved by the United States federal government, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service must make determinations on the listing of numerous species as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could indirectly cause us to incur additional costs, cause our or our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers\u2019 operations to become subject to operating restrictions or bans, and limit future development activity in affected areas, which could reduce demand for our products and services to those customers.\nOur inability to control the inherent risks of identifying and integrating businesses that we may acquire, including any related increases in debt or issuances of equity securities, could adversely affect our operations.\nAcquisitions have been, and our management believes will continue to be, a key element of our growth strategy. We continually review complementary acquisition opportunities and we expect to seek to consummate acquisitions of such businesses in the future. However, we may not be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on favorable terms in the future or at all. In addition, we may be required to incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions and also may issue equity securities in\nconnection with such acquisitions. Such additional debt service requirements could impose a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and the issuance of additional equity securities could result in significant dilution to stockholders.\nWe expect to gain certain business, financial, and strategic advantages as a result of business combinations we undertake, including synergies and operating efficiencies. Our forward-looking statements assume that we will successfully integrate our business acquisitions and realize these intended benefits. However, our inability to realize expected financial performance and strategic advantages as a result of an acquisition, including the GEODynamics and Falcon Acquisitions, could negatively affect the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Additional risks we could face in connection with acquisitions, including the GEODynamics and Falcon Acquisitions, include:\n\u2022\nretaining key employees and customers of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nretaining supply and distribution relationships key to the supply chain;\n\u2022\nincreased administrative burden, including additional costs associated with regulatory compliance;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management time and attention;\n\u2022\ndeveloping our sales and marketing capabilities;\n\u2022\nmanaging our growth effectively;\n\u2022\npotential goodwill impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition;\n\u2022\nintegrating operations, workforce, product lines and technology;\n\u2022\nmanaging tax and foreign exchange exposure;\n\u2022\noperating a new line of business;\n\u2022\nincreased logistical problems common to large, expansive operations;\n\u2022\ninability to pursue and protect patents covering acquired technology;\n\u2022\naddition of acquisition-related debt and increased expenses and working capital requirements;\n\u2022\nsubstantial accounting charges for restructuring and related expenses, write-off of in-process research and development, impairment of goodwill, amortization of intangible assets, and stock-based compensation expense;\n\u2022\nbecoming subject to unanticipated liabilities of the acquired business, including litigation related to the acquired business; and\n\u2022\nachieving the expected benefits from the acquisition, including certain cost savings and operational efficiencies or synergies.\nAdditionally, an acquisition may bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different from those we have previously experienced. If we fail to manage any of these risks successfully, our business could be harmed. Our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly following an acquisition, and stockholders of the Company may not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial, and other relevant information that we will consider in evaluating future acquisitions.\nFollowing our acquisition of GEODynamics in January 2018, we determined that certain steel products historically imported by GEODynamics from China for use in its manufacturing process may potentially be subject to anti-dumping and countervailing duties based on recent clarifications/decisions rendered by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Court of International Trade. Following these findings, we commenced an internal review of this matter and ceased further purchases of these potentially affected Chinese products. As part of our internal review, we engaged trade counsel and decided to voluntarily disclose this matter to U.S. Customs and Border Protection in September 2018. In connection with the GEODynamics acquisition, the seller agreed to indemnify and hold us harmless against certain claims related to matters such as this. Additionally, we are able to set off payments due under the $25.0 million promissory note (see Note 7, \"Long-term Debt\") issued to the seller of GEODynamics in respect of indemnification claims which could affect both the timing of payment and the amount due under the promissory note.\nWe might be unable to compete successfully with other companies in our industry.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive and certain of them have relatively few barriers to entry. The principal competitive factors in our markets are product, equipment and service quality, availability, responsiveness, experience, technology, safety performance, and price. In some of our product and service offerings, we compete with the oil and natural gas industry\u2019s largest oilfield service providers. These large national and multi-national companies have longer operating histories, greater financial, technical, and other resources, and greater name recognition than we do. Several of our competitors provide a broader array of services and have a stronger presence in more geographic markets. In addition, we compete with many smaller companies capable\nof competing effectively on a regional or local basis. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and services, and changes in customer requirements. Many contracts are awarded on a bid basis, which further increases competition based on price. As a result of competition, we may lose market share or be unable to maintain or increase prices for our present services, or to acquire additional business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business and results of operations could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.\nWe rely heavily on information systems to conduct our business. Although we devote significant resources to protect our systems and data, we may experience various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the safety of our employees; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure, or third-party facilities and infrastructure; and threats from terrorist acts. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor these threats and mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information (including our intellectual property and customer data), critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities, essential to our operations, and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe may not have adequate insurance for potential liabilities and our insurance may not cover certain liabilities, including litigation risks.\nThe products that we manufacture and the services that we provide are complex, and the failure of our equipment to operate properly or to meet specifications may greatly increase our customers\u2019 costs. In addition, many of these products are used in inherently hazardous applications where an accident or product failure can cause personal injury or loss of life, damages to property, equipment, or the environment, regulatory investigations and penalties, and the suspension or cancellation of the end-user\u2019s operations. If our products or services fail to meet specifications, or are involved in accidents or failures, we could face warranty, contract, or other litigation claims for which we may be held responsible and our reputation for providing quality products may suffer. In the ordinary course of business, we become the subject of various claims, lawsuits, and administrative proceedings, seeking damages or other remedies concerning our commercial operations, products, employees, and other matters, including occasional claims by individuals alleging exposure to hazardous materials as a result of our products or operations. Some of these claims relate to the activities of businesses that we have sold, and some relate to the activities of businesses that we have acquired, even though these activities may have occurred prior to our acquisition of such businesses.\nWe maintain insurance to cover many of our potential losses, and we are subject to various self-retentions and deductibles under our insurance policies. It is possible, however, that a judgment could be rendered against us in cases in which we could be uninsured and beyond the amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for such matters. Even a partially uninsured or underinsured claim, if successful and of significant size, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or consolidated financial position. We also face the following other risks related to our insurance coverage:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022\nwe may be faced with types of liabilities that will not be covered by our insurance, such as damages from environmental contamination or terrorist attacks;\n\u2022\nthe counterparties to our insurance contracts may pose credit risks; and\n\u2022\nwe may incur losses from interruption of our business that exceed our insurance coverage.\nWe are susceptible to seasonal earnings volatility due to adverse weather conditions in our regions of operations.\nOur operations are directly affected by seasonal differences in weather in the areas in which we operate, most notably in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States and the Gulf of Mexico. Severe winter weather conditions in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States can restrict access to work areas for our Well Site Services and Downhole Technologies segment customers. Our operations in and near the Gulf of Mexico are also affected by weather patterns. Weather conditions in the Gulf Coast region generally result in higher drilling activity in the spring, summer and fall months, with the lowest levels of activity in the winter months. In addition, summer and fall drilling activity can be restricted due to hurricanes and other storms prevalent in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Gulf Coast. As a result of these seasonal differences, full year results are not likely to be a direct multiple of any particular quarter or combination of quarters.\nWe are exposed to risks relating to subcontractors\u2019 performance in some of our projects.\nIn many cases, we subcontract the performance of portions of our operations to subcontractors. While we seek to obtain appropriate indemnities and guarantees from these subcontractors, we remain ultimately responsible for the performance of our subcontractors. Industrial disputes, natural disasters, financial failure or default, or inadequate performance in the provision of services, or the inability to provide services by such subcontractors, has the potential to materially adversely affect us.\nWe depend on several significant customers in each of our business segments, and the loss of one or more such customers or the inability of one or more such customers to meet their obligations to us, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe depend on several significant customers in each of our business segments. While no customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues in 2016, Halliburton Company individually accounted for 10% and 16% of our total consolidated revenues in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe loss of a significant portion of customers in any of our business segments, or a sustained decrease in demand by any of such customers, could result in a substantial loss of revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, the concentration of customers in one industry impacts our overall exposure to credit risk, in that customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic and industry conditions. While we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers, we do not generally require collateral in support of our trade receivables.\nAs a result of our customer concentration, risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by our counterparties are a concern in our business. Many of our customers finance their activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt, or the issuance of equity. Many of our customers have experienced substantial reductions in their cash flows from operations, and some are experiencing liquidity shortages, lack of access to capital and credit markets, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities, and other adverse impacts to their financial condition. These conditions may result in a significant reduction in our customers\u2019 liquidity and ability to pay or otherwise perform on their obligations to us. The inability, or failure of, our significant customers to meet their obligations to us, or their insolvency or liquidation, may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe may assume contractual risks in developing, manufacturing and delivering products in our Offshore/Manufactured Products business segment.\nMany of our products from our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment are ordered by customers under frame agreements or project-specific contracts. In some cases these contracts stipulate a fixed price for the delivery of our products and impose liquidated damages or late delivery fees if we do not meet specific customer deadlines. Our actual costs, and any gross profit realized on these fixed-price contracts, may vary from the initially expected contract economics. This may occur for various reasons, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nerrors in estimates or bidding;\n\u2022\nchanges in availability and cost of materials and labor;\n\u2022\nfailures of our suppliers to deliver raw materials and other goods that comply with our specifications;\n\u2022\nvariations in productivity from our original estimates;\n\u2022\nchanges in tariffs or tax regimes; and\n\u2022\nmaterial changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThese variations and the risks inherent in our projects may result in reduced profitability or losses on projects. Depending on the size of a project, variations from estimated contract performance could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nIn addition, some customer contracts stipulate consequential damages payable, generally as a result of our gross negligence or willful misconduct. The final delivered products may also include customer and third-party supplied equipment, the delay of which can negatively impact our ability to deliver our products on time at our anticipated profitability.\nIn certain cases these orders include new technology or unspecified design elements. There is inherent risk in the estimation process including significant unforeseen technical and logistical challenges, or longer than expected lead times. In some cases we may not be fully, or, properly compensated for the cost to develop and design the final products, negatively impacting our profitability on the projects. In addition, our customers, in many cases, request changes to the original design or bid specifications for which we may not be fully or properly compensated.\nIn fulfilling some contracts, we provide limited warranties for our products. Although we estimate and record a provision for potential warranty claims, repair or replacement costs under warranty provisions in our contracts could exceed the estimated cost to cure the claim, which could be material to our financial results. We utilize percentage-of-completion accounting, depending on the size and length of a project, and variations from estimated contract performance could have a significant impact on our reported operating results as we progress toward completion of major jobs.\nBacklog in our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and, therefore, has limitations as an indicator of our future revenues and earnings.\nThe revenues projected in our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment backlog may not be realized or, if realized, may not result in profits. Because of potential changes in the scope or schedule of our customers\u2019 projects, we cannot predict with certainty when or if backlog will be realized. Material delays, cancellations or payment defaults could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nReductions in our backlog due to cancellations or deferrals by customers, or for other reasons, would adversely affect, potentially to a material extent, the revenues and earnings we actually receive from contracts included in our backlog. Some of the contracts in our backlog are cancellable by the customer, subject to the payment of termination fees and/or the reimbursement of our costs incurred. We typically have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in our backlog once a project is canceled. While backlog cancellations have not been significant in the past, we incurred cancellations totaling $6.5 million, $3.5 million and $3.7 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. If commodity prices do not improve, or decline further, we may incur additional cancellations or experience continued declines in our backlog. If we experience significant project terminations, suspensions, or scope adjustments to contracts included in our backlog, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be adversely impacted.\nWe might be unable to employ a sufficient number of technical and service personnel.\nMany of the products that we sell, especially in our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment, are complex and highly engineered, and often must perform in harsh conditions. We believe that our success depends upon our ability to employ and retain technical personnel with the ability to design, utilize, and enhance these products. In addition, our ability to expand our operations in each of our businesses depends in part on our ability to increase our skilled labor force. As observed in the U.S. shale play regions such as the Permian Basin in recent years, during periods of increased activity, the demand for skilled workers is high, and the supply is limited. When these events occur, our cost structure increases and our growth potential could be impaired. Conversely, during periods of reduced activity, we are forced to reduce headcount, freeze or reduce wages, and implement other cost-saving measures which could lead to job abandonment by our technical and service personnel.\nIf we do not develop new competitive technologies and products, our business and revenues may be adversely affected.\nThe market for our products and services is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better performance in increasingly greater water depths, higher pressure levels and harsher conditions. If we are unable to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in technology, our business and revenues will be adversely affected. Many of our competitors are large multinational companies that may have significantly greater financial resources than we have, and they may be able to devote greater resources to research and development of new systems, services and technologies than we are able to do. In addition, competitors or customers may develop new technologies, which address similar or improved solutions to our existing technology. Additionally, the development and commercialization of new products and services requires substantial capital expenditures and we may not have access to needed capital at attractive rates or at all due to our financial condition, disruptions of the bank or capital markets, or other reasons beyond our control to continue these activities. Should our technologies become the less attractive solution, our operations and profitability would be negatively impacted.\nWe may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights.\nThe tools, techniques, methodologies, programs, and components we use to provide our products and services may infringe, or be alleged to infringe, upon the intellectual property rights of others. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs, and may distract management from running our core business. Royalty payments under a license from third parties, if available, would increase our costs. If a license was not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDuring periods of strong demand or limited supply, we may be unable to obtain critical materials on a timely basis.\nOur operations depend on our ability to procure, on a timely basis, certain project materials, such as forgings, to complete projects and produce products in an efficient and timely manner. Our inability to procure critical materials during times of strong demand/limited supply or at reasonable costs due to supply issues, import taxes or the like, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOur oilfield operations involve a variety of operating hazards and risks that could cause losses.\nOur operations are subject to the hazards inherent in the oilfield business. These include, but are not limited to, equipment defects, blowouts, explosions, spills, fires, collisions, capsizing, and severe weather conditions. These hazards could result in personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to, or destruction of, property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, and suspension of operations. We may incur substantial liabilities or losses as a result of these hazards as part of our ongoing business operations. We may agree to indemnify our customers against specific risks and liabilities. While we maintain insurance protection against some of these risks, and seek to obtain indemnity agreements from our customers requiring the customers to hold us harmless from some of these risks, our insurance and contractual indemnity protection may not be sufficient or effective enough to protect us under all circumstances or against all risks. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations to us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur common stock price has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations in response to the highly cyclical nature of our industry and a variety of other factors, including quarterly variations in operating results, conditions in the oil and gas industry, perceptions of our industry, analyst reports, estimates and commentary, general economic conditions and numerous other events or factors that are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the U.S. stock markets in general and the market for oil field service companies, in particular, have experienced large price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating results or asset values of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may materially impact the market price and trading volume of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance.\nWe might be unable to protect our intellectual property rights and we may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on a variety of intellectual property rights that we use in our businesses, particularly our patents relating to our FlexJoint\u00ae and Merlin\u2122 technology and intervention and downhole extended-reach tools (including our HydroPull\u00ae tool) utilized in the completion or workover of oil and natural gas wells. The market success of our technologies will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and enforce our proprietary rights in these technologies, to preserve rights in our trade secret and non-public information, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights and these rights could be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, we may be required to expend significant amounts of capital pursuing and defending our intellectual property rights, and these proceedings may not ultimately be successful. For example, during 2018 we incurred expenses in excess of $8 million in connection with patent defense. If any of our patents or other intellectual property rights are determined to be invalid or unenforceable, or if a court or other tribunal limits the scope of claims in a patent or fails to recognize our trade secret rights, our competitive advantages could be significantly reduced in the relevant technology, allowing competition for our customer base to increase.\nIn addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which our products and services may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The failure of our Company to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could adversely affect our competitive position.\nThe Spin-Off of Civeo may subject us to future liabilities.\nWe spun off (the \"Spin-Off\") our accommodations business to Civeo Corporation (\"Civeo\"), a stand-alone, publicly traded corporation, through a tax-free distribution to our stockholders on May 30, 2014.\nPursuant to agreements we entered into with Civeo in connection with the Spin-Off, we and Civeo are each generally responsible for the obligations and liabilities related to our respective businesses. Pursuant to those agreements, we and Civeo each agreed to cross-indemnities principally designed to allocate financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of our business to us and those of Civeo\u2019s business to it. However, third parties, including governmental agencies, could seek to hold us responsible for\nobligations and liabilities that Civeo agreed to retain or assume, and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from Civeo will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such obligations and liabilities, or that Civeo will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Additionally, if a court were to determine that the Spin-Off or related transactions, including the payment of the dividend we received from Civeo, were consummated with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud current or future creditors or resulted in Civeo receiving less than reasonably equivalent value when it was insolvent, or that it was rendered insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due, then it is possible that the court could disregard the allocation of obligations and liabilities agreed to between us and Civeo and impose substantial obligations and liabilities on us, void some or all of the Spin-Off transactions or require us to repay some or all of the dividend we received in connection with the Spin-Off. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, we received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") regarding certain aspects of the Spin-Off. The private letter ruling, and an opinion we received from our tax advisor, each rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from us and Civeo regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings are, or become, incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, we may not be able to rely on the private letter ruling or the opinion of our tax advisor and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. In addition, an opinion of counsel is not binding upon the IRS, so, notwithstanding the opinion of our tax advisor, the IRS could conclude upon audit that the Spin-Off is taxable in full or in part if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in our or Civeo\u2019s stock ownership. If the Spin-Off is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any reason, we and/or our stockholders could incur significant income tax liabilities.", "PERMNO": 88897, "SIC": 3533, "TIC": "OIS"}
