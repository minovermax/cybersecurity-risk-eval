RISK FACTORS\nWe operate in an environment that involves a number of significant risks and uncertainties. We caution you to read the following risk factors, which have affected, and/or in the future could affect, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. The risks described below include forward-looking statements, and actual events and our actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. Furthermore, additional risks and uncertainties are described under other captions in this report and should also be considered by our investors.\nSUMMARY OF MATERIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, discussed in more detail in the following section. These risks include, among others, the following key risks:\nBusiness Related Risks - Risks Related to Our Financial Results\n\u2022The current pandemic of COVID-19 and its variants and the future outbreak of other highly infectious or contagious diseases, could continue to have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our commercial operations and sales, clinical trials and pre-clinical studies, and could impact other areas of our business as well.\n\u2022The marketing and sale of ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI, OXLUMO or any future products, including vutrisiran, may be unsuccessful or less successful than anticipated and we may be unable to expand the indication for ONPATTRO, or, if approved, vutrisiran.\n\u2022We have a history of losses and may never become and remain consistently profitable.\n\u2022We will require substantial funds to continue our research, development and commercialization activities.\n\u2022Although we sold a portion of the expected royalty stream and commercial milestones related to global sales of Leqvio by Novartis, we are entitled to retain the remaining portion of such future royalties and, if certain specified thresholds are met, to the remaining portion of commercial milestone payments, and any negative developments related to Leqvio could have a material adverse effect on the timing or amount of those payments.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\n\u2022We may not be able to execute our business strategy if we are unable to maintain existing or enter into new alliances with other companies that can provide business and scientific capabilities and funds for the development and commercialization of certain of our product candidates.\n\u2022If any collaborator materially amends, terminates or fails to perform its obligations under agreements with us, the development and commercialization of certain of our product candidates could be delayed or terminated and we could suffer other economic harm.\n\u2022We have limited manufacturing experience and resources, and we must incur significant costs to develop this expertise and/or rely on third parties to manufacture our products.\n\u2022We rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, and if they fail to fulfill their obligations, our development plans may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Managing Our Operations\n\u2022If we are unable to attract and retain qualified key management and scientists, development, medical and commercial staff, consultants and advisors, our ability to implement our business plan may be adversely affected.\n\u2022We recently underwent our first CEO succession. Any leadership transition carries with it disruption risks that could have a negative impact on the execution of our Alnylam P5x25 strategy. These risks include our ability to attract and retain qualified employees.\n\u2022We may have difficulty expanding our operations successfully as we continue our evolution from a U.S.- and Europe-based company primarily involved in discovery, pre-clinical testing and clinical development into a global company that develops and commercializes multiple drugs in multiple geographies including Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.\n\u2022We may experience computer system failures or unauthorized or inappropriate use of or access to our information systems or those of our contractors or collaborators, potentially resulting in substantial loss of data, business interruption or other harm.\nIndustry Related Risks - Risks Related to Development, Clinical Testing and Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates and the Commercialization of Our Approved Products\n\u2022Any product candidates we or our partners develop may fail in development or be delayed to a point where they do not become commercially viable.\n\u2022We or our partners may be unable to obtain U.S. or foreign regulatory approval for our or our partnered product candidates.\n\u2022Even if we or our partners obtain regulatory approvals, our marketed drugs will be subject to ongoing regulatory oversight.\n\u2022Even if we receive regulatory approval to market our product candidates, and our collaborators receive regulatory approval to market product candidates discovered by us or developed with our technology, the market may not be receptive to such product candidates upon their commercial introduction, which could prevent us from becoming profitable.\n\u2022We are a multi-product commercial company and expect to continue to invest significant financial and management resources to continue to scale our marketing, sales, market access and distribution capabilities and further establish our global commercial and compliance infrastructure, and our commercial efforts may not be successful.\n\u2022The patient populations suffering from hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, AHP, and PH1 are small and have not been established with precision.\n\u2022We may incur significant liability if enforcement authorities allege or determine that we are engaging in commercial activities or promoting our commercially approved products in a way that violates applicable regulations, including in connection with the ongoing DOJ investigation.\n\u2022Any drugs we develop may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, thereby harming our business.\n\u2022Governments outside the U.S. may impose strict price controls, and the U.S. government may impose price controls or reference pricing, which may adversely affect our revenues.\nRisks Related to Patents, Licenses and Trade Secrets\n\u2022If we are not able to obtain and enforce patent protection for our discoveries, our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates will be harmed.\n\u2022We license patent rights from third-party owners. If such owners do not properly or successfully obtain, maintain or enforce the patents underlying such licenses, our competitive position and business prospects may be harmed.\n\u2022Other companies or organizations may challenge our patent rights or may assert patent rights that prevent us from developing and commercializing our products.\n\u2022If we become involved in patent litigation or other proceedings related to a determination of rights, we could incur substantial costs and expenses, substantial liability for damages or be required to stop our product development and commercialization efforts.\n\u2022If we fail to comply with our obligations under any licenses or related agreements, we may be required to pay damages and could lose license or other rights that are necessary for developing, commercializing and protecting our RNAi technology.\nRisks Related to Competition\n\u2022The pharmaceutical market is intensely competitive. If we are unable to compete effectively with existing drugs, new treatment methods and new technologies, we may be unable to commercialize successfully any drugs that we or our collaborators develop.\n\u2022We face competition from other companies that are working to develop novel drugs and technology platforms using technology similar to ours, as well as from companies utilizing emerging technologies, including gene therapy and gene editing.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\u2022If our stock price fluctuates, purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\n\u2022We may incur significant costs from class action litigation.\n\u2022Future sales of shares of our common stock, including by our significant stockholders, us or our directors and officers, could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\n\u2022Regeneron\u2019s ownership of our common stock could delay or prevent a change in corporate control.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nRisks Related to Our Financial Results\nThe current pandemic of COVID-19 and its variants, and the future outbreak of other highly infectious or contagious diseases, could continue to have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our commercial operations and sales, clinical trials and pre-clinical studies.\nThe novel coronavirus identified in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease known as COVID-19, has led to an ongoing global pandemic that continues to evolve and the ultimate impact of this pandemic remains highly uncertain. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the implementation of various responses, including government-imposed quarantines, travel restrictions and other public health safety measures. COVID-19 has and may continue to impact our operations and those of our third-party partners and the ultimate impact on our business and financial results remains uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, and will depend on many factors, including the scope, severity, duration and any recurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic, including through any new variant strains of the underlying virus, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, the effectiveness of vaccination and booster vaccination campaigns, among others. The continued development and fluidity of the COVID-19 pandemic precludes any prediction as to its full impact on our business.\nIn response to the spread of COVID-19, we took, and have continued to take, both temporary and ongoing precautionary measures, intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees and their families, including implementing a global work from home policy in early March 2020 for nearly all employees who were able to perform their duties remotely. In addition, in October 2021, we implemented a mandatory vaccination policy requiring all U.S. employees and contractors to be fully vaccinated, subject to certain medical and religious accommodations. Where and to the extent permitted to be open under local regulations, our office sites are operational with appropriate safety precautions based on COVID-19 vaccination rates and local guidance, and in October 2021, we formally re-opened our U.S. offices to those employees who have been fully vaccinated. Working arrangements for many of our employees differ from the arrangements before the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect a number of employees will continue to work in a remote capacity or a hybrid of in-person and remote work. We may face several challenges or disruptions during our return to the workplace transition, including re-integration challenges for our employees, and our hybrid of in-person and remote work option may negatively impact productivity, or disrupt, delay, or otherwise adversely impact our business. Compliance with governmental measures imposed in response to COVID-19 has caused and will continue to cause us to incur additional costs, and any inability to comply with such measures can subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines, and other penalties, any of which can adversely affect our business. We cannot predict when certain restrictions that are in place to protect our employees can be further reduced or will no longer be needed. In addition, the increase in certain of our employees working remotely has amplified certain risks to our business, including increased demand on our information technology resources and systems, increased phishing and other cybersecurity attacks, and any failure to effectively manage these risks, including to timely identify and appropriately respond to any cyberattacks, could adversely impact our business operations.\nAs the pandemic continues, and if conditions worsen or if the duration of the pandemic extends significantly, we may experience disruptions that could severely impact our business and operations, including our ability to successfully commercialize our approved products, and we may not be able to meet expectations with respect to commercial sales. In addition, we may also experience decreased patient demand for our approved products if current or potential patients decide to delay treatment as a result of the COVID-19 or a future pandemic. Business interruptions from the current or future pandemics, including staffing shortages, raw material or other supply chain shortages, production slowdowns and disruptions in delivery\nsystems, may also adversely impact the third parties we or our partners rely on in the U.S. and abroad to sufficiently manufacture our approved products and to produce product candidates in quantities we require, which may impair our commercialization efforts, our research and development activities and the potential commercialization of our product candidates.\nAdditionally, timely completion of pre-clinical activities and initiation of planned clinical trials are dependent upon the availability of, for example, pre-clinical and clinical trial sites, researchers and investigators, patients or healthy volunteer subjects available for recruitment and enrollment, and regulatory agency personnel, which may be adversely affected by global health matters, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We are conducting and plan to continue to conduct pre-clinical activities and clinical trials for our drug product candidates in geographies which have been and continue to be affected by COVID-19, and believe that the COVID-19 pandemic will have an impact on various aspects of our ongoing clinical trials and on the clinical trials and pre-clinical studies we expect to initiate in 2022. For example, certain trial sites in some of our ongoing clinical trials were restricted temporarily by the institutions where they are located from scheduling patient visits or permitting onsite monitoring due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in some of our ongoing trials, delayed or missed doses of study drug have been reported. Any business interruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could also delay necessary interactions with local regulators, ethics committees, manufacturing sites, research or clinical trial sites and other important agencies and contractors, which could adversely impact the clinical trials of our product candidates.\nHealth regulatory agencies globally may also experience disruptions in their operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may impact review, inspection and approval timelines. Since March 2020, when foreign and domestic inspections of facilities were largely placed on hold, the FDA has been working to resume routine surveillance, bioresearch monitoring and pre-approval inspections on a prioritized basis. Since April 2021, the FDA has conducted limited inspections and employed remote interactive evaluations, using risk management methods, to meet user fee commitments and goal dates. Ongoing travel restrictions and other uncertainties continue to impact oversight operations both domestic and abroad and it is unclear when standard operational levels will resume. The FDA is continuing to complete mission-critical work, prioritize other higher-tiered inspectional needs (e.g., for-cause inspections), and carry out surveillance inspections using risk-based approaches. Should the FDA determine that an inspection is necessary for approval of a marketing application and an inspection cannot be completed during the review cycle due to restrictions on travel, and the FDA does not determine a remote interactive evaluation to be adequate, the FDA has stated that it generally intends to issue, depending on the circumstances, a complete response letter or defer action on the application until an inspection can be completed. For example, in December 2020, the FDA issued a complete response letter regarding Novartis' NDA for inclisiran, stating that the agency could not approve the NDA by the PDUFA action date due to unresolved facility inspection-related conditions. The FDA ultimately approved Novartis' NDA in December 2021. Regulatory authorities outside the U.S. may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and may experience delays in their regulatory activities.\nSome factors from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that may delay or otherwise adversely affect enrollment in and the conduct of the clinical trials of our product candidates, as well as adversely impact our business generally, include:\n\u2022the diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials to focus on pandemic concerns, including the availability of materials necessary to conduct our clinical trials;\n\u2022limitations on travel that could interrupt key trial activities, such as clinical trial site initiations and monitoring, domestic and international travel by employees, contractors or patients to clinical trial sites, including any government-imposed travel restrictions or quarantines that will impact the ability or willingness of patients, employees or contractors to travel to our research, manufacturing and clinical trial sites or secure visas or entry permissions, any of which could delay or adversely impact the conduct or progress of our clinical trials; and\n\u2022interruption of, or delays in receiving, supplies of our product candidates from our CMOs due to staffing shortages, production slowdowns, raw material or other supply shortages, or stoppages and disruptions in delivery systems.\nThese and other factors arising from the COVID-19 pandemic could worsen in countries with higher infection rates and case counts, or could return to countries where the pandemic has been partially contained, each of which could further adversely impact our ability to conduct clinical trials and our business generally, and could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition and results. In addition, a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nThe marketing and sale of ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI, OXLUMO or any future products, including vutrisiran, may be less successful than anticipated, and we may be unable to expand the indication for ONPATTRO, or, if approved, vutrisiran.\nIn 2018, our first commercial product, ONPATTRO, was approved by the FDA and EMA, and we have since received approval and launched ONPATTRO in several additional territories. In 2019, the FDA approved our second product, GIVLAARI, which was also approved by the EMA and has since received approval in several additional territories, and in 2020, the FDA and EMA approved our third product, OXLUMO, which received additional regulatory approvals in 2021. We also have several product candidates in late-stage clinical development, including vutrisiran, which is currently under review by the FDA, and has a PDUFA date of April 14, 2022, as well as other agencies. While we have commercially launched three\nproducts, we cannot predict whether we will successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties encountered by companies commercializing products in the biopharmaceutical industry. To execute our business plan of building a profitable, top five biotech company over the next 5 years and achieving our Alnylam P5x25 strategy and the metrics associated with such strategy, in addition to successfully marketing and selling our approved products we will need to successfully:\n\u2022execute product development activities and continue to leverage new technologies related to both RNAi and to the delivery of siRNAs to the relevant tissues and cells, including the liver, CNS, eye, lung and muscle;\n\u2022successfully execute our leadership succession plan;\n\u2022build and maintain a strong intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022gain regulatory acceptance for the development and commercialization of our product candidates and market success for our approved products, as well as any other products we commercialize;\n\u2022attract and retain customers for our products;\n\u2022develop and maintain successful strategic alliances; and\n\u2022manage our spending as costs and expenses increase due to clinical trials, regulatory approvals and commercialization.\nIf we are unsuccessful in accomplishing the objectives set forth above, we may not be able to develop product candidates, successfully commercialize our approved products or any future products, raise capital, if needed, repay the debt we incurred in 2020 and 2021, expand our business, achieve financial self-sustainability or continue our operations.\nWe have a history of losses and may never become and remain consistently profitable.\nWe have experienced significant operating losses since our inception. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of 5.44 billion. Although to date we have launched three products in the U.S., EU and various other countries globally, and expect to launch our commercially approved products in additional countries during 2022 and beyond, we may never attain profitability or positive cash flow from operations. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized $662.1 million in net product revenues from sales of ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO. While our full year operating loss for 2021 and 2020 each improved relative to the prior year, marking 2019 as our peak operating loss year, we expect to continue to incur annual operating losses, and will require substantial resources over the next several years as we expand our efforts to discover, develop and commercialize RNAi therapeutics, and aim to achieve self-sustainability by the end of 2025. While we believe the funding provided by our strategic financing collaboration with Blackstone should enable us to achieve a self-sustainable profile without the need for future equity financing, we will depend on our ability to generate revenues to achieve this goal. In addition to revenues derived from sales of our current and future, if any, commercially approved products, we anticipate that a portion of any revenues we generate over the next several years will continue to be from alliances with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including Novartis and Regeneron. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain our existing alliances, secure and maintain new alliances, meet the obligations, or achieve any milestones that we may be required to meet or achieve to receive payments under our existing or new alliances. Moreover, we cannot be certain that our partners, including Novartis, will continue to successfully execute their obligations under our alliance agreements and generate additional revenues for us.\nWe believe that to become and remain consistently profitable, we must succeed in discovering, developing and commercializing novel drugs with significant market potential. This will require us to build upon the success we have had in a range of challenging activities, including continued platform innovation, pre-clinical testing and clinical trial stages of development, obtaining regulatory approval and reimbursement for these novel drugs and manufacturing, marketing and selling them. We may never generate revenues that are significant enough to achieve profitability and, even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. If we cannot become and remain consistently profitable, the market price of our common stock could decline. In addition, we may be unable to raise capital, expand our business, develop additional product candidates or continue our operations.\nWe will require substantial funds to continue our research, development and commercialization activities and if the funds we require are greater than what we have estimated, we may need to critically limit or significantly scale back or cease our operations.\nWe have used substantial funds to develop our RNAi technologies and will require substantial funds to conduct further research and development, including pre-clinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates, and to manufacture, market and sell our three approved products and any other products that are approved for commercial sale. Because the length of time or activities associated with successful development of our product candidates, including vutrisiran, may be greater than we anticipate, we are unable to estimate the actual funds we will require to develop and commercialize them.\nWe believe 2019 was our peak operating loss year, and believe that our strategic financing collaboration with Blackstone will enable us to achieve a self-sustainable financial profile without need for future equity financing. However, our future capital requirements and the period for which we expect our existing resources to support our operations may vary from what we expect. We have based our expectations on a number of factors, many of which are difficult to predict or are outside of our control, including:\n\u2022progress in our research and development programs, including programs in both rare and prevalent diseases as well as what may be required by regulatory bodies to advance these programs;\n\u2022the timing, receipt and amount of milestone and other payments, if any, from present and future collaborators, if any, including milestone payments related to Leqvio, which is being commercialized by our partner, Novartis;\n\u2022our ability to maintain and establish additional collaborative arrangements and/or new business initiatives;\n\u2022the potential for improved product profiles to emerge from our new technologies and our ability to successfully advance our delivery efforts in extrahepatic tissues;\n\u2022the resources, time and costs required to successfully initiate and complete our pre-clinical and clinical studies, obtain regulatory approvals, prepare for global commercialization of our product candidates and obtain and maintain licenses to third-party intellectual property;\n\u2022our ability to establish, maintain and operate our own manufacturing facilities in a timely and cost-effective manner;\n\u2022our ability to manufacture, or contract with third parties for the manufacture of, our product candidates for clinical testing and commercial sale;\n\u2022the impact of COVID-19 on the initiation or completion of pre-clinical studies or clinical trials and the supply of our products or product candidates;\n\u2022the resources, time and cost required for the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of patent claims;\n\u2022the costs associated with legal activities, including litigation and government investigations, arising in the course of our business activities and our ability to prevail or reach a satisfactory result in any such legal disputes and investigations;\n\u2022the timing, receipt and amount of sales and royalties, if any, from our approved products and our potential products, if and when approved; and\n\u2022the outcome of the regulatory review process and commercial success of drug products for which we are entitled to receive royalties, including Leqvio.\nIf our estimates, predictions and financial guidance relating to these factors are incorrect, we may need to modify our operating plan and may be required to seek additional funding in the future. We may do so through either collaborative arrangements, public or private equity offerings or debt financings, royalty or other monetization transactions or a combination of one or more of these funding sources. Additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nIn April 2020, we entered into a credit agreement, or Credit Agreement, for up to $750.0 million among us, certain of our subsidiaries (together with us, the Loan Parties), funds or accounts managed or advised by GSO Capital Partners LP (now Blackstone Alternative Credit Advisors LP) and certain other affiliates of Blackstone, and the other lenders from time to time party thereto and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as the administrative agent for the lenders. The Credit Agreement provided for a senior secured delayed draw term loan facility, funded in three tranches, or Term Loans, each tranche as requested by certain dates specified in the Credit Agreement, and subject to customary terms and conditions in the case of each tranche. The Term Loans mature seven years from the date of the first draw, and bear interest at a variable rate. All obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by security interests in certain assets, including the intellectual property owned by us relating to ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI and vutrisiran, the equity interests held by the Loan Parties in their subsidiaries, all of our ownership of the inclisiran royalty remaining after the royalty purchase and material real property, and certain personal property, including, without limitation, cash held in certain deposit accounts of the Loan Parties and equipment. The Credit Agreement contains negative covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, could restrict our ability to, incur additional liens, incur additional indebtedness, make investments, including acquisitions, engage in fundamental changes, sell or dispose of assets that constitute collateral, including certain intellectual property, pay dividends or make any distribution or payment on or redeem, retire or purchase any equity interests, amend, modify or waive certain material agreements or organizational documents and make payments of certain subordinated indebtedness. The Credit Agreement also requires us to have consolidated liquidity of at least $100.0 million as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. Additionally, the Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and provisions relating to events of default. In August 2020, in connection with execution of the funding agreement for the clinical development of vutrisiran and zilebesiran (formerly ALN-AGT), or Funding Agreement, we entered into the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement. The First Amendment added certain intellectual property owned by us relating to zilebesiran as collateral under the Credit Agreement, as amended, and made certain other amendments related thereto and the Funding Agreement. In December 2020, we drew down the first tranche of $200.0 million and the second and third tranches of $250.0 million each, were drawn under the Credit Agreement, as amended, in June and December 2021, respectively. Our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Credit Agreement, as amended, and meet our debt service obligations will depend upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are\nbeyond our control. If we default on our Term Loans, we may not be able to replace the financing commitment on favorable terms, or at all.\nThe terms of any financing we may be required to pursue in the future notwithstanding the funds due or available to us from Blackstone may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, further dilution to our existing stockholders will result. In addition, as a condition to providing additional funding to us, future investors may demand, and may be granted, rights superior to those of existing stockholders. For example, pursuant to our stock purchase agreement with Blackstone, we agreed to register the resale of the shares purchased on a registration statement and filed a registration statement on June 5, 2020. In addition, subject to certain conditions, Blackstone will be entitled to participate in registered underwritten public offerings by us if other selling stockholders are included in the registration.\nIf we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis, we may be required to significantly delay or curtail one or more of our research or development programs, or delay or curtail the further development of our global commercial infrastructure, and our ability to achieve our long-term strategic goals may be delayed or diminished. We also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies, product candidates or products that we would otherwise pursue on our own.\nAlthough we sold a portion of the royalty stream and commercial milestones from the global sales of Leqvio by our collaborator, Novartis, we are entitled to retain the remaining portion of future royalties from the global sales of Leqvio and, if certain specified thresholds are met, to the remaining portion of commercial milestone payments, and any negative developments related to Leqvio could have a material adverse effect on our receipt of those payments.\nIn April 2020, we sold to Blackstone 50% of the royalties payable to us with respect to net sales by Novartis, its affiliates or sublicensees of Leqvio and 75% of the commercial milestone payments payable to us under the MDCO agreement. If Blackstone does not receive royalty payments in respect of global sales of Leqvio equaling at least $1.00 billion by December 31, 2029, Blackstone\u2019s royalty interest will increase to 55% effective January 1, 2030. Our receipt of future royalty payments and a portion of commercial milestone payments may be negatively impacted if the Leqvio royalty stream and commercial milestones payments are insufficient to meet the specified thresholds. For example, in December 2020, the FDA issued a complete response letter regarding Novartis' NDA for inclisiran, stating that the agency could not approve the NDA by the PDUFA action date due to unresolved inspection-related conditions at a third party manufacturing facility, delaying the potential approval and launch of Leqvio in the U.S., as well as payment of an associated approval milestone and potential royalties. While Leqvio was granted marketing authorization by the EC in Europe in December 2020, and was approved by the FDA in December 2021, any negative impact to future royalty payments and commercial milestone payments could affect our ability to meet the specified repayment thresholds. Additional factors that may have an adverse effect on the Leqvio royalty stream and commercial milestones include:\n\u2022companies working to develop new therapies or alternative formulations of products for ASCVD;\n\u2022foreign currency movement, which could have a negative impact on Novartis\u2019 sales of Leqvio, thereby reducing the royalties;\n\u2022any negative developments relating to Leqvio, such as safety, efficacy, or reimbursement issues, could reduce demand for Leqvio;\n\u2022any disputes concerning patents, proprietary rights, or license and collaboration agreements could negatively impact our receipt of commercial milestone payments or royalties; and\n\u2022adverse regulatory or legislative developments could limit or prohibit the sale of Leqvio, such as restrictions on the use of Leqvio or safety-related label changes, including enhanced risk management programs, which may significantly reduce expected royalty revenue and commercial milestone payments and could require significant expense to address the associated legal and regulatory issues.\nIf the revenues generated by sales of Leqvio are lower than expected, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe expect our operating results to fluctuate in future periods, which may adversely affect our stock price.\nOur quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past, and may continue to do so in the future. Our operating results may fluctuate due to the impact of the COVID-19 and related variants or a future pandemic, the level of success of our commercial efforts and resulting revenues, as well as the variable nature of our operating expenses as a result of the timing and magnitude of expenditures. For example, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, product revenues in the second quarter of 2020 for ONPATTRO were less than originally forecast. In addition, in one or more future periods, our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the market price of our common stock could substantially decline.\nIf the estimates we make, or the assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our consolidated financial statements and/or our projected guidance prove inaccurate, our actual results may vary from those reflected in our projections and accruals.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We cannot assure you, however, that our estimates, or the assumptions underlying them, will be correct.\nFurther, from time to time we issue financial guidance relating to our expectations regarding our combined product sales, collaboration and royalty revenues, and GAAP and non-GAAP research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses, and expectations for our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities available for operations, which guidance is based on estimates and the judgment of management. If, for any reason, our revenues and/or expenses differ materially from our guidance or we utilize our cash more quickly than anticipated, we may have to adjust our publicly announced financial guidance. If we fail to meet, or if we are required to change or update any element of, our publicly disclosed financial guidance or other expectations about our business, our stock price could decline.\nThe investment of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities is subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $2.44 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We historically have invested these amounts in high-grade corporate notes, commercial paper, securities issued or sponsored by the U.S. government, certificates of deposit and money market funds meeting the criteria of our investment policy, which is focused on the preservation of our capital. Corporate notes may also include foreign bonds denominated in U.S. dollars. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. We may realize losses in the fair value of these investments or a complete loss of these investments, which would have a negative effect on our consolidated financial statements. In addition, should our investments cease paying or reduce the amount of interest paid to us, our interest income would suffer. The market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur revenue from outside of the U.S. will increase as our products, whether commercialized by us or our collaborators, gain marketing approval in such jurisdictions. Our primary foreign currency exposure relates to movements in the Japanese yen, Euro and British pound. If the U.S. dollar weakens against a specific foreign currency, our revenues will increase, having a positive impact on net income, but our overall expenses will increase, having a negative impact. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar strengthens against a specific foreign currency, our revenues will decrease, having a negative impact on net income, but our overall expenses will decrease, having a positive impact. Therefore, significant changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in tax law could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to numerous international, federal, state, and other governmental laws, rules, and regulations that may adversely affect our operating results, including, taxation and tax policy changes, tax rate changes, new tax laws, or revised tax law interpretations, which individually or in combination may cause our effective tax rate to increase. In the U.S., the rules dealing with federal, state, and local income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury Department. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect us or holders of our common stock. In recent years, many such changes have been made and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future. Future changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition or results of operations.\nAdditionally, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, the EC, and individual taxing jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. The OECD has released its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting. In addition, the OECD, the EC and individual countries are examining changes to how taxing rights should be allocated among countries considering the digital economy. As a result, the tax laws in the U.S. and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could materially adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe may not be able to execute our business strategy if we are unable to maintain existing or enter into new alliances with other companies that can provide business and scientific capabilities and funds for the development and commercialization of our product candidates. If we are unsuccessful in forming or maintaining these alliances on terms favorable to us, our business may not succeed.\nWe are continuing to advance our commercial capabilities, including in marketing, sales, market access and distribution, to support our wholly-owned products. We also continue to advance our growing pipeline of RNAi therapeutic opportunities. However, we may not have adequate capacity or capabilities to advance all of our therapeutic opportunities. Accordingly, we have entered into alliances with other companies and collaborators that we believe can provide such capabilities in certain territories and/or for certain product candidates, and we intend to enter into additional such alliances in the future. Our collaboration strategy is to form alliances that create significant value for us and our collaborators in the advancement of RNAi therapeutics as a new class of innovative medicines. Specifically, with respect to our Genetic Medicine pipeline, as a result of our broad strategic alliance with Sanofi formed in 2014, Sanofi has the right to develop and commercialize fitusiran globally. In addition, we formed a collaboration with MDCO (which was acquired by Novartis in January 2020) to advance inclisiran. In March 2018, we entered into a discovery collaboration with Regeneron to identify RNAi therapeutics for NASH and potentially other related diseases, and in November 2018, we and Regeneron entered into a separate, fifty-fifty collaboration to further research, co-develop and commercialize any therapeutic product candidates that emerge from these discovery efforts. In October 2017, we announced an exclusive licensing agreement with Vir for the development and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics for infectious diseases, including chronic HBV infection. In April 2020, we entered into a development and commercialization collaboration with Dicerna (which was acquired by Novo Nordisk in December 2021) to advance investigational RNAi therapeutics for the treatment of alpha-1 liver disease. With respect to our CNS/Ocular Disease pipeline, in April 2019, we announced a global, strategic collaboration with Regeneron to discover, develop and commercialize RNAi therapeutics for a broad range of diseases by addressing therapeutic targets expressed in the eye and CNS, in addition to a select number of targets expressed in the liver.\nIn such alliances, we expect our current, and may expect our future, collaborators to provide substantial capabilities in clinical development, regulatory affairs, and/or marketing, sales and distribution. Under certain of our alliances, we also may expect our collaborators to develop, market and/or sell certain of our product candidates. We may have limited or no control over the development, sales, marketing and distribution activities of these third parties. Our future revenues may depend heavily on the success of the efforts of these third parties. For example, we will rely entirely on (i) Regeneron for the development and commercialization of all programs targeting eye diseases (subject to limited exceptions), and potentially other CNS and liver programs, (ii) Novartis for all future development and commercialization of Leqvio worldwide, and (iii) Sanofi for the development and commercialization of fitusiran worldwide. In the case of each such collaboration referenced in clauses (i)-(iii) above, we are entitled to royalties on the sales of each of these products. If our collaborators are not successful in their development and/or commercialization efforts, our future revenues from RNAi therapeutics for these indications may be adversely affected. For example, while Leqvio was granted marketing authorization by the EC in Europe, in December 2020, Novartis received a complete response letter from the FDA stating that the agency could not approve the NDA by the PDUFA action date due to unresolved inspection-related conditions at a third party manufacturing facility. While Leqvio was approved by the FDA in December 2021, the resolution of the complete response letter resulted in a delay in the payment of an approval milestone and potential U.S. royalties. If the revenues generated by the royalties received by Blackstone from us with respect to Leqvio sales do not reach a certain level by the end of 2029, Blackstone will be entitled to a higher royalty percentage beginning in 2030, which would have an adverse impact on our revenues beginning in 2030.\nWe may not be successful in entering into future alliances on terms favorable to us due to various factors, including our ability to demonstrate improved product profiles from our new technologies, including our IKARIA and GEMINI platforms, our ability to successfully demonstrate proof-of-concept for our technology in humans in certain tissues or disease areas, including our alternative conjugate approach for delivering CNS or ocular product candidates or other extrahepatic approaches, our ability to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our specific drug candidates, our ability to manufacture or have third parties manufacture RNAi therapeutics, the strength of our intellectual property and/or concerns around challenges to our intellectual property. For example, our decision in October 2016 to discontinue development of revusiran could give rise to concerns around the safety and/or efficacy of our technology platform or product candidates. In addition, the occurrence of a fatal thrombotic serious adverse event, or SAE, in our fitusiran study in 2017 and a subsequent pause in dosing and enrollment in fitusiran clinical studies in 2020 could contribute to further concerns about the safety of specific therapeutic candidates or therapeutic candidates for specific diseases. Even when we succeed in securing such alliances, we may not be able to maintain them if, for example, development or approval of a product candidate is delayed, challenges are raised as to the validity or scope of our intellectual property, we are unable to secure adequate reimbursement from payors or sales of an approved drug are lower than we expected.\nFurthermore, any delay in entering into collaboration agreements would likely either delay the development and commercialization of certain of our product candidates and reduce their competitiveness even if they reach the market, or prevent the development of certain product candidates. Any such delay related to our collaborations could adversely affect our business.\nFor certain product candidates, we have formed collaborations to fund all or part of the costs of drug development and commercialization, such as our collaborations with Regeneron, Novartis, Vir, Dicerna (acquired by Novo Nordisk) and Sanofi. We may not, however, be able to enter into additional collaborations for certain other programs, and the terms of any collaboration agreement we do secure may not be favorable to us. If we are not successful in our efforts to enter into future collaboration arrangements with respect to one or more of our product candidates, we may not have sufficient funds to develop\nthese product candidates or other product candidates internally, or to bring our product candidates to market. If we do not have sufficient funds to develop and bring our product candidates to market, we will not be able to generate revenues from these product candidates, and this will substantially harm our business.\nIf any collaborator materially amends, terminates or fails to perform its obligations under agreements with us, the development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed or terminated.\nOur dependence on collaborators for capabilities and funding means that our business could be adversely affected if any collaborator materially amends or terminates its collaboration agreement with us or fails to perform its obligations under that agreement. Our current or future collaborations, if any, may not be scientifically or commercially successful. Disputes may arise in the future with respect to the ownership of rights to technology or products developed with collaborators, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to develop and commercialize any affected product candidate. Our current collaborations allow, and we expect that any future collaborations will allow, either party to terminate the collaboration for a material breach by the other party. In addition, our collaborators may have additional termination rights for convenience with respect to the collaboration or a particular program under the collaboration, under certain circumstances. For example, our agreement with MDCO, which was acquired by Novartis in January 2020, relating to the development and commercialization of inclisiran worldwide may be terminated by Novartis at any time upon four months\u2019 prior written notice, provided if the agreement is terminated by Novartis for convenience, Novartis must grant a license to us under certain of our technology developed in the course of MDCO's activities under the agreement, subject to a royalty to be negotiated between the parties. Moreover, any adverse actions by Novartis with respect to the MDCO agreement or disputes with Novartis regarding each party's rights and obligations under the MDCO agreement could adversely impact our ability to comply with our obligations under our agreements with Blackstone. If we were to lose a commercialization collaborator, we would have to attract a new collaborator or develop expanded sales, distribution and marketing capabilities internally, which would require us to invest significant amounts of financial and management resources.\nIn addition, if we have a dispute with a collaborator over the ownership of technology or other matters, or if a collaborator terminates its collaboration with us, for breach or otherwise, or determines not to pursue the research, development and/or commercialization of RNAi therapeutics, it could delay our development of product candidates, result in the need for additional company resources to develop product candidates, require us to expend time and resources to develop expanded sales and marketing capabilities on a more expedited timeline, make it more difficult for us to attract new collaborators and could adversely affect how we are perceived in the business and financial communities.\nMoreover, a collaborator, or in the event of a change in control of a collaborator or the assignment of a collaboration agreement to a third party, the successor entity or assignee, as in the case of MDCO and Novartis, could determine that it is in its interests to:\n\u2022pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products, either on its own or jointly with others, that may be competitive with the products on which it is collaborating with us or which could affect its commitment to the collaboration with us;\n\u2022pursue higher-priority programs or change the focus of its development programs, which could affect the collaborator\u2019s commitment to us; or\n\u2022if it has marketing rights, choose to devote fewer resources to the marketing of our product candidates, if any are approved for marketing, than it does for product candidates developed without us.\nIf any of these occur, the development and commercialization of one or more products or product candidates could be delayed, curtailed or terminated because we may not have sufficient financial resources or capabilities to continue such development and commercialization on our own.\nWe have limited manufacturing experience and resources and we must incur significant costs to develop this expertise and/or rely on third parties to manufacture our products.\nWe have limited manufacturing experience. In order to continue to commercialize our approved products, continue to develop our current product candidates, including vutrisiran, apply for regulatory approvals and, if approved, commercialize future products, we will need to develop, contract for, or otherwise arrange for the necessary manufacturing capabilities. Historically, our internal manufacturing capabilities were limited to small-scale production of material for use in in vitro and in vivo experiments that is not required to be produced under cGMP standards. During 2012, we developed cGMP capabilities and processes for the manufacture of patisiran formulated bulk drug product for late stage clinical trial use and commercial supply. In addition, during 2020, we completed construction and qualification of our cGMP manufacturing facility in Norton, Massachusetts where we manufacture drug substance for clinical and, eventually, will manufacture for commercial use. In December 2020, we began cGMP operations, and we believe this facility will enable us to initiate manufacturing for multiple new early-stage programs over the next few years, as well as provide us the manufacturing capabilities to support our late-stage and commercial programs in the future.\nAt the present time, we may manufacture limited quantities of clinical trial materials ourselves, but otherwise we continue to rely on third parties to manufacture the drug substance and finished product we will require for any clinical trials that we initiate and to support the commercial supply of our approved products and any of our other product candidates. There are a limited number of manufacturers that supply synthetic siRNAs. We currently rely on a limited number of CMOs for our supply of synthetic siRNAs. There are risks inherent in pharmaceutical manufacturing that could affect the ability of our CMOs to meet our delivery time requirements or provide adequate amounts of material to meet our needs, and ultimately delay our clinical trials and potentially put at risk commercial supply, as well as result in additional expense to us. To fulfill our siRNA requirements, we will likely need to secure alternative suppliers of synthetic siRNAs and such alternative suppliers are limited and may not be readily available, or we may be unable to enter into agreements with them on reasonable terms and in a timely manner. As noted above, in order to ensure long-term supply capabilities for our RNAi therapeutics, we are developing our own capabilities to manufacture drug substance for clinical and commercial use.\nIn addition to the manufacture of the synthetic siRNAs, we may have additional manufacturing requirements related to the technology required to deliver the siRNA to the relevant cell or tissue type, such as LNPs or conjugates. In some cases, the delivery technology we utilize is highly specialized or proprietary, and for technical and/or legal reasons, we may have access to only one or a limited number of potential manufacturers for such delivery technology. In addition, the scale-up of our delivery technologies could be very difficult and/or take significant time. We also have very limited experience in such scale-up and manufacturing, requiring us to depend on a limited number of third parties, who might not be able to deliver in a timely manner, or at all. Failure by manufacturers to properly manufacture our delivery technology and/or formulate our siRNAs for delivery could result in unusable product, supply delays and shortages. Furthermore, competition for supply from our manufacturers from other companies, a breach by such manufacturers of their contractual obligations or a dispute with such manufacturers would cause delays in our discovery and development efforts, as well as additional expense to us. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, was enacted in March 2020, and requires that manufacturers have in place a risk management plan that identifies and evaluates the risks to the supply of approved drugs for certain serious diseases or conditions for each establishment where the drug or active pharmaceutical ingredient is manufactured. The risk management plan will be subject to FDA review during an inspection. If we experience shortages in the supply of our marketed products, as a result of COVID-19 or otherwise, our results could be materially impacted. To date, three vaccines for COVID-19 have received Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA and two of those have since received marketing approval. Additional vaccines may be authorized or approved in the future. The resultant demand for vaccines and potential for manufacturing facilities and materials to be commandeered under the Defense Production Act of 1950, or equivalent foreign legislation, may make it more difficult to obtain materials or manufacturing slots for the products needed for our clinical trials or commercial products, which could lead to delays in these trials or issues with our commercial supply.\nIn developing manufacturing capabilities by building our own manufacturing facilities, we have incurred substantial expenditures, and expect to incur significant additional expenditures in the future. Also, we have had to, and will likely need to continue to, hire and train qualified employees to staff our facilities. If we are unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of material or if we encounter problems with our facilities in the future, we may also need to secure alternative suppliers, and such alternative suppliers may not be available, or we may be unable to enter into agreements with them on reasonable terms and in a timely manner. Given our dependence on a limited number of CMOs to supply our commercial products and clinical candidates, and our dependence on our own facility, any delay in supply caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could impact our ability to procure sufficient supplies for our approved products, and the development of our product candidates could also be delayed. Any delay or setback in the manufacture of our approved products could impede ongoing commercial supply, which could significantly impact our revenues and operating results. In addition, to the extent we or our partners rely on CMOs outside of the U.S. to supply drug substance for our product candidates, any delays or disruptions in supply caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse impact on the research and development activities and potential commercialization of our or our partners' product candidates.\nThe manufacturing process for our approved products and any other products that we may develop, is subject to the FDA and foreign regulatory authority approval process and we will need to meet, and will need to contract with CMOs who can meet, all applicable FDA and foreign regulatory authority requirements on an ongoing basis. In addition, if we receive the necessary regulatory approval for any product candidate, we also expect to rely on third parties, including potentially our commercial collaborators, to produce materials required for commercial supply.\nTo the extent that we have existing, or enter into future, manufacturing arrangements with third parties, we depend, and will depend in the future, on these third parties, to perform their obligations in a timely manner and consistent with contractual and regulatory requirements, including those related to quality control and quality assurance. The failure of any CMO to perform its obligations as expected, or, to the extent we manufacture all or a portion of our product candidates ourselves, our failure to execute on our manufacturing requirements, could adversely affect our business in a number of ways, including:\n\u2022we or our current or future collaborators may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials of product candidates that are under development;\n\u2022we or our current or future collaborators may be delayed in submitting regulatory applications, or receiving regulatory approvals, for our product candidates;\n\u2022we may lose the cooperation of our collaborators;\n\u2022our facilities and those of our CMOs, and our products could be the subject of inspections by regulatory authorities that could have a negative outcome and result in delays in supply;\n\u2022we may be required to cease distribution or recall some or all batches of our products or take action to recover clinical trial material from clinical trial sites; and\n\u2022ultimately, we may not be able to meet commercial demands for our products.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, and if they fail to fulfill their obligations, our development plans may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations, or CROs, and other third-party service providers to assist us in managing, monitoring and otherwise carrying out our clinical trials. We have contracted, and we plan to continue to contract with, certain third parties to provide certain services, including site selection, enrollment, monitoring, auditing and data management services. These investigators and CROs are not our employees and we have limited control over the amount of time and resources they dedicate to our programs. These third parties may have contractual relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors, which may draw their time and resources away from our programs. Although we depend heavily on these parties, we control only certain aspects of their activity and therefore, we cannot be assured that these third parties will adequately perform all of their contractual obligations to us in compliance with regulatory and other legal requirements and our internal policies and procedures. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs are required to comply with applicable GCP requirements, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our product candidates in clinical development, and to implement timely corrective action to any non-compliance. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCP requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites, including in connection with the review of marketing applications. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCP requirements, or fail to take any such corrective action, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, the EMA, the PMDA in Japan or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to take additional action or perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority in the future, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP regulations.\nIf our third-party service providers cannot adequately and timely fulfill their obligations to us for any reason, including due to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on their operations or at the sites they are overseeing, or if the quality and accuracy of our clinical trial data is compromised due to failure by such third party to adhere to our protocols or regulatory requirements or if such third parties otherwise fail to meet deadlines, our development plans and/or regulatory reviews for marketing approvals may be delayed or terminated. As a result, our stock price would likely be negatively impacted, and our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate additional revenues could be delayed.\nRisks Related to Managing Our Operations\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified key management and scientists, development, medical and commercial staff, consultants and advisors, in particular following our recent leadership transition, our ability to implement our business plan may be adversely affected.\nWe are highly dependent upon our senior management and our scientific, clinical, sales and medical staff. We recently underwent our first leadership transition, and we believe our current management team is well-positioned to execute our strategy. Nonetheless, this recent leadership transition may be viewed negatively by employees, investors and/or our strategic partners. Moreover, attrition associated with this transition could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of product development and commercialization, and other business objectives, and adversely impact our stock price. Our employment arrangements with our key personnel are terminable without notice. We do not carry key person life insurance on any of our employees.\nWe have grown our workforce significantly over the past several years and anticipate continuing to add additional employees as we focus on achieving our Alnylam P5x25 strategy. We face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, governmental entities and other research institutions, many of which have substantially greater resources with which to attract and reward qualified individuals than we do. In addition, due to the risks associated with developing a new class of medicine, we may face additional challenges in attracting and retaining employees. If we are not successful commercializing our approved products, we may be unable to attract and retain highly qualified sales and marketing professionals to support our approved products and our future products, if approved,\nincluding vutrisiran. Accordingly, we may be unable to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals in order to support our growing research, development and global commercialization efforts and initiatives, and our failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our future business plans.\nWe may have difficulty expanding our operations successfully as we continue our evolution from a U.S.- and EU-based company primarily involved in discovery, pre-clinical testing and clinical development into a global company that develops and commercializes multiple drugs.\nAs we continue the commercial launches of our approved products, and increase the number of product candidates we are developing, we will need to continue to expand our operations in the U.S. and further develop operations in the EU and other geographies, including Asia and Latin America. To date, we have received regulatory approval for three products, which we have launched in multiple geographies globally, and we continue to expand the reach of these products with additional regulatory filings and launches. In addition, we have a fourth product under review by regulatory authorities.\nWe have grown our workforce significantly over the last five years and anticipate continuing to hire additional employees globally in the future as we focus on the commercialization of ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO, preparing for the potential launch of vutrisiran and achieving our Alnylam P5x25 strategy. This growth has placed a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure and, as a result, we will need to continue to develop additional and/or new infrastructure and capabilities to support our growth and obtain additional space to conduct our global operations in the U.S., the EU, Japan, Latin America and other geographies. If we are unable to develop such additional infrastructure or obtain sufficient space to accommodate our growth in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. As we continue the commercialization of our approved products, and as the product candidates we develop enter and advance through clinical trials, we will need to continue to expand our global development, regulatory, manufacturing, quality, compliance, and marketing and sales capabilities, or contract with other organizations to provide these capabilities for us. In addition, as our operations continue to expand, we will need to successfully manage additional relationships with various collaborators, suppliers, distributors and other organizations. Our ability to manage our operations and future growth will require us to continue to enhance our operational, financial and management controls and systems, reporting systems and infrastructure, ethics and compliance functions, and policies and procedures. We may not be able to implement enhancements to our management information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls.\nThe use of social media presents risks and challenges.\nSocial media is being used to communicate about our clinical development programs and the diseases our investigational RNAi therapeutics are being developed to treat, and we are utilizing what we believe is appropriate social media in connection with our commercialization efforts for our approved products, and we intend to do the same for our future products, if approved, including vutrisiran. Social media practices in the biopharmaceutical industry continue to evolve and regulations and regulatory guidance relating to such use are evolving and not always clear. This evolution creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business, resulting in potential regulatory actions against us, along with the potential for litigation related to off-label marketing or other prohibited activities. For example, for our clinical-stage candidates, patients may use social media channels to comment on their experience in an ongoing blinded clinical study or to report an alleged AE. When such disclosures occur, there is a risk that study enrollment may be adversely impacted, we fail to monitor and comply with applicable adverse event, or AE, reporting obligations or that we may not be able to defend our business or the public\u2019s legitimate interests in the face of the political and market pressures generated by social media due to restrictions on what we may say about our investigational products. There is also a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any online platform, including a blog on the internet, or a post on a website, that can be distributed rapidly and could negatively harm our reputation. If any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face regulatory actions or incur other harm to our business.\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures or unauthorized or inappropriate use of or access to our systems.\nWe are increasingly dependent on our information technology systems and infrastructure for our business. We collect, store and transmit sensitive information including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information in connection with business operations. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Some of this information could be an attractive target of criminal attack or unauthorized access and use by third parties with a wide range of motives and expertise, including organized criminal groups, \u201chacktivists,\u201d patient groups, disgruntled current or former employees and others. Cyber-attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication, and despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to such attacks or may be breached, including due to employee error or malfeasance.\nThe pervasiveness of cybersecurity incidents in general and the risks of cyber-crime are complex and continue to evolve. Although we are making significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information systems and are exploring various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and\nmeasures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses, unauthorized or inappropriate access or use, natural disasters, pandemics (including COVID-19), terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures. Such events could cause interruption of our operations. For example, the loss of pre-clinical trial data or data from completed or ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory filings and development efforts, as well as delays in the commercialization of our products, and significantly increase our costs. To the extent that any disruption, security breach or unauthorized or inappropriate use or access to our systems were to result in a loss of or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, including but not limited to patient, employee or vendor information, we could incur notification obligations to affected individuals and government agencies, liability, including potential lawsuits from patients, collaborators, employees, stockholders or other third parties and liability under foreign, federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of personal information, and the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed.\nOur business and operations may be negatively impacted by the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the EU.\nFollowing the results of a referendum in 2016, the United Kingdom, or UK, left the EU on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d Pursuant to the formal withdrawal arrangements agreed between the UK and the EU, the UK was subject to a transition period until December 31, 2020, or the Transition Period, during which EU rules continued to apply, while the future relationship between the UK and EU was formally negotiated. The UK and the EU have signed an EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, or TCA, which became provisionally applicable on January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations. At present, Great Britain has implemented EU legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the EU regulatory framework will continue to apply in Northern Ireland). The regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore currently aligns with EU regulations, however it is possible that these regimes will diverge in future now that Great Britain\u2019s regulatory system is independent from the EU and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical legislation. It remains to be seen how Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for medicinal products and devices in the UK in the long-term.\nSince the expiry of the Transition Period, Great Britain is no longer covered by centralized marketing authorizations (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, centralized marketing authorizations will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). For a period of two years from January 1, 2021, the MHRA, the UK medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by the EC on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain marketing authorization. A separate application will, however, still be required. Any new divergent regulations in Great Britain and the EU could add time and expense to the conduct of our business, as well as the process by which our products receive regulatory approval in the UK, the EU and elsewhere. Any of these longer-term effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nRisks Related to Development, Clinical Testing and Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates and the Commercialization of Our Approved Products\nAny product candidates we or our partners develop may fail in development or be delayed to a point where they do not become commercially viable.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval for the commercial distribution of our product candidates, we must conduct, at our own expense, extensive nonclinical tests and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and/or efficacy in humans of our product candidates. Nonclinical and clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome, and the historical failure rate for product candidates is high. We currently have multiple programs in clinical development, including internal and partnered programs in Phase 3 development, as well as several earlier-stage clinical programs. In January 2021, we announced positive topline results from the HELIOS-A Phase 3 study of vutrisiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic in development for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis. Based on these positive results in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, we submitted an NDA for vutrisiran with the FDA in April 2021, which was accepted by the FDA. The FDA has set an action date of April 14, 2022 under PDUFA, and indicated that they were not currently planning an advisory committee meeting as part of the NDA review. In September 2021, we presented additional 9-month data from the HELIOS-A Phase 3 study of vutrisiran, and submitted an MAA in the EU with the EMA. Further, in January 2022, we reported positive full results for 18-month endpoints and safety from the HELIOS-A Phase 3 study of vutrisiran. We are also conducting additional Phase 3 trials of vutrisiran and patisiran in ATTR patients with cardiomyopathy. However, we may not be able to further advance these or any other product candidate through clinical trials and regulatory approval.\nAdditionally, several of our planned and ongoing clinical trials, such as our HELIOS-A study, utilize an \u201copen-label\u201d trial design. An \u201copen-label\u201d clinical trial is one where both the patient and investigator know whether the patient is receiving the investigational product candidate or either an existing approved drug or placebo. Most typically, open-label clinical trials test only the investigational product candidate and sometimes may do so at different dose levels. Open-label clinical trials are subject to various limitations that may exaggerate any therapeutic effect as patients in open-label clinical trials are aware when they are receiving treatment. Open-label clinical trials may be subject to a \u201cpatient bias\u201d where patients perceive their symptoms to have improved merely due to their awareness of receiving an experimental treatment. In addition, open-label clinical trials may be subject to an \u201cinvestigator bias\u201d where those assessing and reviewing the physiological outcomes of the clinical trials are aware of which patients have received treatment and may interpret the information of the treated group more favorably given this knowledge. The results from an open-label trial may not be predictive of future clinical trial results with any of our product candidates for which we include an open-label clinical trial when studied in a controlled environment with a placebo or active control.\nIf we enter into clinical trials, the results from nonclinical testing or early or late stage clinical trials of a product candidate may not predict the results that will be obtained in subsequent subjects or in subsequent human clinical trials of that product candidate or any other product candidate. For example, we are conducting the APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B Phase 3 clinical trials of patisiran and vutrisiran, respectively, which are investigating the potential of patisiran and vutrisiran to treat the cardiac manifestations of disease in patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. While both patisiran and vutrisiran have demonstrated positive results in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, we cannot be certain that the results from APOLLO-B and/or HELIOS-B will be positive or support approval of patisiran and/or vutrisiran for the treatment of patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. There is a high failure rate for drugs proceeding through clinical studies. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in clinical development even after achieving promising results in earlier studies, and any such setbacks in our clinical development, including with respect to patisiran and/or vutrisiran, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Moreover, our approved products and our current product candidates, employ novel delivery technologies that, with the exception of inclisiran, have yet to be extensively evaluated in human clinical trials and proven safe and effective.\nIn addition, we, the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities, or an IRB, or similar foreign review board or committee, may delay initiation of or suspend clinical trials of a product candidate at any time for various reasons, including if we or they believe the healthy volunteer subjects or patients participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks. Among other reasons, adverse side effects of a product candidate or related product on healthy volunteer subjects or patients in a clinical trial could result in our decision, or a decision by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, to suspend or terminate the trial, or, in the case of regulatory agencies, a refusal to approve a particular product candidate for any or all indications of use. For example, in October 2016, we announced our decision to discontinue development of revusiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic that was being developed for the treatment of patients with cardiomyopathy due to hATTR amyloidosis. Our decision followed the recommendation of the revusiran ENDEAVOUR Phase 3 study Data Monitoring Committee to suspend dosing and the observation of an imbalance in mortality in revusiran-treated patients as compared to those on placebo.\nClinical trials of a new product candidate require the enrollment of a sufficient number of patients, including patients who are suffering from the disease the product candidate is intended to treat and who meet other eligibility criteria. Rates of patient enrollment are affected by many factors, including the size of the patient population, the age and condition of the patients, the stage and severity of disease, the availability of clinical trials for other investigational drugs for the same disease or condition, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease, and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial. For example, we or our partners may experience difficulty enrolling our clinical trials, including, but not limited to, the ongoing clinical trials for fitusiran, due to the availability of existing approved treatments, as well as other investigational treatments in development. In addition, in November 2018 we announced that due to recruitment challenges, we had discontinued a Phase 2 study of cemdisiran in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and are focusing our cemdisiran clinical development efforts in a different indication. Delays or difficulties in patient enrollment or difficulties retaining trial participants, including as a result of the availability of existing or other investigational treatments or safety concerns, including the impact of public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can result in increased costs, longer development times or termination of a clinical trial.\nAlthough our investigational RNAi therapeutics have been generally well-tolerated in our clinical trials to date, new safety findings may emerge. For example, in September 2017, we announced that we had temporarily suspended dosing in all ongoing fitusiran studies pending further review of a fatal thrombotic SAE that occurred in a patient with hemophilia A without inhibitors who was receiving fitusiran in our Phase 2 OLE study. More recently, in October 2020, Sanofi voluntarily paused dosing in all ongoing fitusiran clinical studies to assess reports of non-fatal thrombotic events in patients participating in the ATLAS Phase 3 program. Following an assessment of available data and alignment with regulators, patients restarted on fitusiran under amended protocols in ongoing adolescent and adult clinical studies. In October 2021, Sanofi announced that a potential filing date for fitusiran has been moved to 2024 due to the introduction of a lower dose cohort in the ongoing phase 3 studies.\nAs demonstrated by the discontinuation of our revusiran program in October 2016, the temporary suspension of dosing in September 2017 in our fitusiran studies, as well as Sanofi's voluntary pause of fitusiran studies in October 2020, the occurrence of SAEs and/or AEs can result in the suspension or termination of clinical trials of a product candidate by us, our partners, or the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority. The occurrence of SAEs and/or AEs could also result in refusal by the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority to approve a particular product candidate for any or all indications of use.\nClinical trials also require the review, oversight and approval of IRBs, or, outside of the U.S., an independent ethics committee, which continually review clinical investigations and protect the rights and welfare of human subjects. Inability to obtain or delay in obtaining IRB or ethics committee approval can prevent or delay the initiation and completion of clinical trials, and the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may decide not to consider any data or information derived from a clinical investigation not subject to initial and continuing IRB or ethics committee review and approval, as the case may be, in support of a marketing application.\nOur product candidates that we develop may encounter problems during clinical trials that will cause us, an IRB, ethics committee or regulatory authorities to delay, suspend or terminate these trials, or that will delay or confound the analysis of data from these trials. If we experience any such problems, we may not have the financial resources to continue development of the product candidate that is affected, or development of any of our other product candidates. We may also lose, or be unable to enter into, collaborative arrangements for the affected product candidate and for other product candidates we are developing.\nA failure of one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, nonclinical testing and the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent regulatory approval or our ability to commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u2022our nonclinical tests or clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional nonclinical testing or clinical trials, or we may abandon projects that we expect to be promising;\n\u2022delays in filing IND applications or comparable foreign applications or delays or failure in obtaining the necessary approvals from regulators or IRBs/ethics committees in order to commence a clinical trial at a prospective trial site, or their suspension or termination of a clinical trial once commenced;\n\u2022conditions imposed on us by an IRB or ethics committee, or the FDA or comparable foreign authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials;\n\u2022problems in engaging IRBs or ethics committees to oversee clinical trials or problems in obtaining or maintaining IRB or ethics committee approval of trials;\n\u2022delays in enrolling patients and volunteers into clinical trials, and variability in the number and types of patients and volunteers available for clinical trials, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022disruptions caused by man-made or natural disasters or public health pandemics or epidemics or other business interruptions, including the current COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022high drop-out rates for patients and volunteers in clinical trials;\n\u2022negative or inconclusive results from our clinical trials or the clinical trials of others for product candidates similar to ours;\n\u2022inadequate supply or quality of product candidate materials or other materials necessary for the conduct of our clinical trials or disruption or delays in the clinical supply due to the COVID-19 or a future pandemic;\n\u2022greater than anticipated clinical trial costs;\n\u2022serious and unexpected drug-related side effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials or by individuals using drugs similar to our product candidates;\n\u2022poor or disappointing effectiveness of our product candidates during clinical trials;\n\u2022unfavorable FDA or other regulatory agency inspection and review of a clinical trial site or records of any clinical or nonclinical investigation;\n\u2022failure of our third-party contractors or investigators to comply with regulatory requirements, including GCP and cGMP, or otherwise meet their contractual obligations in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022governmental or regulatory delays and changes in regulatory requirements, policy and guidelines, including the imposition of additional regulatory oversight around clinical testing generally or with respect to our technology in particular; or\n\u2022interpretations of data by the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies that differ from ours.\nEven if we successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates, any given product candidate may not prove to be a safe and effective treatment for the disease for which it was being tested.\nWe or our partners may be unable to obtain U.S. or foreign regulatory approval for our or our partnered product candidates and, as a result, we or our partners may be unable to commercialize such product candidates.\nOur and our partnered product candidates are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to, among other things, research, testing, development, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, approval, recordkeeping, reporting, labeling, storage, pricing, marketing and distribution of drugs. Rigorous nonclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process are required to be successfully completed in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions before a new drug can be marketed. Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays. It is possible that the product candidates we and our partners are developing will not obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for us or our collaborators to begin selling them.\nThe time required to obtain FDA and other regulatory approvals is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials, depending upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate. The standards that the FDA and its foreign counterparts use when regulating us are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. Any analysis we perform of data from nonclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. We or our partners may also encounter unexpected delays or increased costs due to new government regulations, for example, from future legislation or administrative action, or from changes in FDA policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and FDA regulatory review. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA or foreign regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.\nBecause the drugs we or our partners are developing represent a new class of drug, the FDA and its foreign counterparts have not yet established any definitive policies, practices or guidelines in relation to these drugs. The lack of policies, practices or guidelines may hinder or slow review by the FDA of any regulatory filings that we or our partners may submit. Moreover, the FDA may respond to these submissions by defining requirements we or our partners may not have anticipated. Such responses could lead to significant delays and increased costs in the development of our or our partnered product candidates. In addition, because there may be approved treatments for some of the diseases for which we or our partners may seek approval, or treatments in development which are approved by the time we or they apply for approval, in order to receive regulatory approval, we or they may need to demonstrate through clinical trials that the product candidates we develop to treat these diseases, if any, are not only safe and effective, but safer or more effective than existing products. Interruption or delays in the operations of the FDA, EMA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies due to the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the review, inspection and approval timelines for our or our partnered product candidates. During the COVID-19 public health emergency, the FDA has worked to ensure timely reviews of applications for medical products in line with its user fee performance goals and conduct mission critical domestic and foreign inspections to ensure compliance of manufacturing facilities with FDA quality standards. However, the FDA may not be able to continue its current pace and approval timelines could be extended, including where a pre-approval inspection or an inspection of clinical sites is required and due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and travel restrictions the FDA is unable to complete such required inspections during the review period. During the COVID-19 public health emergency, a number of companies announced receipt of complete response letters due to the FDA's inability to complete required inspections for their applications. In December 2020, the FDA issued a complete response letter regarding Novartis' NDA for inclisiran, stating that the agency could not approve the NDA by the PDUFA action date due to unresolved facility inspection-related conditions. In July 2021, Novartis announced that the resubmission to the FDA of the inclisiran NDA to address the complete response letter was filed, and the FDA approved Leqvio (which is the trade name under which inclisiran will be marketed in the U.S.) in December 2021. The delay in the approval of Leqvio resulted in delayed milestone and royalty revenue to us. Any similar interruption or delay by the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory agency in light of the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our efforts to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, including vutrisiran, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nAny delay or failure in obtaining required approvals for our product candidates or our partnered product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues from any product candidate for which we or our partners may seek approval in the future. Furthermore, any regulatory approval to market any product may be subject to limitations on the approved uses for which we or our partners may market the product or the labeling or other restrictions, which could limit each such product\u2019s market opportunity and have a negative impact on our results of operations and our stock price. In addition, the FDA has the authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan as part of an NDA, or after approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved drug, such as limiting prescribing to certain physicians or medical centers that have undergone specialized training, limiting treatment to patients who meet certain safe-use criteria and requiring treated patients to enroll in a registry. In the EU, we or our partners could be required to adopt a similar plan, known as a risk management plan, and our products could be subject to specific risk minimization measures, such as restrictions on prescription and supply, the conduct of post-marketing safety or efficacy studies, or the distribution of patient and/or prescriber educational materials. In either instance, these limitations and restrictions may limit the size of the market for the product and affect reimbursement by third-party payors.\nWe are also subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and third-party reimbursement. The foreign regulatory approval process varies among countries and includes all of the risks associated with FDA approval described above as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of local regulations in foreign jurisdictions. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities outside the U.S. and vice versa.\nEven if we or our partners obtain regulatory approvals, our marketed drugs will be subject to ongoing regulatory oversight. If we or our partners fail to comply with continuing U.S. and foreign requirements, our approvals could be limited or withdrawn, we could be subject to other penalties, and our business would be seriously harmed.\nFollowing any initial regulatory approval of drugs we or our partners may develop, including our three approved drugs, we will also be subject to continuing regulatory oversight, including the review of adverse drug experiences and clinical results that are reported after our drug products are made commercially available. This would include results from any post-marketing tests or surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of our approved drugs or other drug products required as a condition of approval or agreed to by us. The regulatory approvals that we receive for ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO, as well as any regulatory approvals we receive for any other product candidates, including vutrisiran, may also be subject to limitations on the approved uses for which the product may be marketed. Other ongoing regulatory requirements include, among other things, submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing, as well as continued compliance with good practice quality guidelines and regulations, including cGMP requirements and GCP requirements for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. In addition, we are conducting, and intend to continue to conduct, clinical trials for our product candidates, and we intend to seek approval to market our product candidates, in jurisdictions outside of the U.S., and therefore will be subject to, and must comply with, regulatory requirements in those jurisdictions.\nThe FDA has significant post-market authority, including, for example, the authority to require labeling changes based on new safety information and to require post-market studies or clinical trials to evaluate serious safety risks related to the use of a drug and to require withdrawal of the product from the market. The FDA also has the authority to require a REMS plan after approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved drug. As our approved products are used commercially, we or others could identify previously unknown side effects or known side effects could be observed as being more frequent or severe than in clinical studies or earlier post-marketing periods, in which case:\n\u2022sales of our approved products may be more modest than originally anticipated;\n\u2022regulatory approvals for our approved products may be restricted or withdrawn;\n\u2022we may decide, or be required, to send product warning letters or field alerts to physicians, pharmacists and hospitals;\n\u2022additional nonclinical or clinical studies, changes in labeling, adoption of a REMS plan, or changes to manufacturing processes, specifications and/or facilities may be required; and\n\u2022government investigations or lawsuits, including class action suits, may be brought against us.\nAny of the above occurrences could reduce or prevent sales of our approved products, increase our expenses and impair our ability to successfully commercialize one or more of these products.\nThe CMO and manufacturing facilities we use to make our approved products and certain of our current product candidates, including our Cambridge facility, our Norton facility, as well as facilities at Agilent and other CMOs, will also be subject to periodic review and inspection by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. For example, Agilent and our Cambridge-based facility were subject to regulatory inspection by the FDA and the EMA in connection with the review of our applications for regulatory approval for ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI, and may be subject to similar inspection in connection with any subsequent applications for regulatory approval of one or more of our products filed in other territories. The discovery of any new or previously unknown problems with our facilities or our CMOs, or our or their manufacturing processes or facilities, may result in restrictions on the drug or CMO or facility, including delay in approval or, in the future, withdrawal of the drug from the market. We have developed cGMP capabilities and processes for the manufacture of patisiran formulated bulk drug product for commercial use. In addition, in 2020, we completed construction of a cGMP manufacturing facility for drug substance for clinical and, eventually, commercial use. We may not have the ability or capacity to manufacture material at a broader commercial scale in the future. We may manufacture clinical trial materials, or we may contract a third party to manufacture this material for us. Reliance on CMOs entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured products ourselves, including reliance on the CMO for regulatory compliance.\nIf we or our collaborators, CMOs or service providers fail to comply with applicable continuing regulatory requirements in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions in which we may seek to market our products, we or they may be subject to, among other things, fines, warning letters, holds on clinical trials, refusal by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval, product recalls and seizures, refusal to permit the import or export of products, operating restrictions, injunction, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.\nWe may incur significant liability if enforcement authorities allege or determine that we are engaging in commercial activities or promoting our commercially approved products in a way that violates applicable regulations.\nPhysicians have the discretion to prescribe approved drug products for uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling and that differ from those approved by the FDA or other applicable regulatory agencies. Off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Although the FDA and other regulatory agencies that approve drug products do not regulate a physician\u2019s practice of medicine or choice of treatments, the FDA and other regulatory agencies regulate a manufacturer\u2019s communications regarding off-label use and prohibit off-label promotion, as well as the dissemination of false or misleading labeling or promotional materials, including by their agents. Manufacturers and their agents may not promote drugs for off-label uses or provide off-label information in the promotion of drug products that is not consistent with the approved labeling for those products. For example, we may not promote ONPATTRO in the U.S. for use in any indications other than the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis in adults. The FDA and other regulatory and enforcement authorities actively enforce laws and regulations prohibiting promotion of off-label uses and the promotion of products for which marketing approval has not been obtained. In April 2021, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Massachusetts, requiring production of documents pertaining to our marketing and promotion of ONPATTRO (patisiran) in the U.S. We are cooperating with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and producing documents in response to the subpoena. Current and former officers and employees also have received subpoenas in connection with the preservation and production of related materials. Given the ongoing nature of the investigation, it is possible that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Massachusetts or other government entities may request other information from, or issue other subpoenas, findings or similar documents to, us, our related entities and their respective directors, officers and employees. If we are found to have improperly marketed or promoted ONPATTRO in connection with such subpoenas, we may be subject to a broad range of civil, administrative and criminal penalties, including injunctive relief related to ONPATTRO promotional activities, substantial fines or penalties, and other legal or equitable sanctions. Any adverse decision, finding, allegation, or exercise of enforcement or regulatory discretion could harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. Other internal or government investigations or legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits brought by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence.\nNotwithstanding regulations related to product promotion, the FDA and other regulatory authorities allow companies to engage in truthful, non-misleading and non-promotional scientific exchange concerning their products, and we intend to engage in medical education activities and communicate with healthcare providers in compliance with all applicable laws and regulatory guidance. Nonetheless, the FDA, other applicable regulatory authorities, competitors, and other third parties may take the position that we are not in compliance with such regulations, and if such non-compliance is proven, it could harm our reputation, financial condition or divert financial and management resources from our core business, and would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, any threatened or actual government enforcement actions or lawsuits by third parties could also generate adverse publicity, which could decrease demand for our products and require that we devote substantial resources that could be used productively on other aspects of our business.\nIn addition to our medical education efforts, we also offer patient support services to assist patients receiving treatment with our commercially approved products. Manufacturers have increasingly become the focus of government investigation of patient support programs based on allegations that through such services illegal inducements are provided to physicians and/or patients, leading to improper utilization of government resources through Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs. Companies that are found to have violated laws such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and/or FCA face significant liability, including civil and administrative penalties, criminal sanctions, and potential exclusion from participation in government programs.\nAs described above we remain focused on our global compliance program, which is designed to support the execution of these programs and activities in compliance with applicable laws.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval to market our product candidates, the market may not be receptive to our product candidates upon their commercial introduction, which could prevent us from becoming profitable.\nThe product candidates that we are developing are based upon new technologies or therapeutic approaches. Key participants in pharmaceutical marketplaces, such as physicians, third-party payors and consumers, may not accept a product intended to improve therapeutic results based on RNAi technology. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to convince the medical community and third-party payors to accept and use our product, or to provide favorable reimbursement.\nOther factors that we believe will materially affect market acceptance of our product candidates include:\n\u2022the timing of our receipt of any marketing approvals, the terms of any approvals and the countries in which approvals are obtained;\n\u2022the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, as demonstrated in clinical trials and as compared with alternative treatments, if any;\n\u2022relative convenience and ease of administration of our product candidates;\n\u2022the willingness of patients to accept potentially new routes of administration or new or different therapeutic approaches and mechanisms of action;\n\u2022the success of our physician education programs;\n\u2022the availability of adequate government and third-party payor reimbursement;\n\u2022the pricing of our products, particularly as compared to alternative treatments, and the market perception of such prices and any price increase that we may implement in the future; and\n\u2022availability of alternative effective treatments for the diseases that product candidates we develop are intended to treat and the relative risks, benefits and costs of those treatments.\nFor example, ONPATTRO utilizes an intravenous mode of administration with pre-medication that physicians and/or patients may not readily adopt, or which may not compete favorably with other available options, including inotersen, marketed by Ionis in several countries, which is administered subcutaneously, or tafamidis, marketed by Pfizer Inc., or Pfizer, in several countries, which is in pill form. In addition, fitusiran represents a new approach to treating hemophilia which may not be readily accepted by patients and their caregivers.\nWe are a multi-product commercial company and expect to continue to invest significant financial and management resources to continue to build our marketing, sales, market access and distribution capabilities and further establish our global infrastructure. Even if we successfully scale our commercial capabilities, the market may not be receptive to our commercial products.\nHaving received our first product approval only four years ago, we have established our capabilities for marketing, sales, market access and distribution over the last several years. We currently expect to rely on third parties to launch and market certain of our product candidates in certain geographies, if approved. However, we intend to commercialize ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO, as well as several of our late-stage product candidates if approved, including vutrisiran, on our own globally in major markets. Accordingly, we have developed internal marketing, sales, market access and distribution capabilities as part of our core product strategy initially in the U.S., Europe and Japan, with expansion ongoing globally, which has, and will continue to, require significant financial and management resources. For those products for which we will perform marketing, sales, market access and distribution functions ourselves, including ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI, OXLUMO and, if approved, vutrisiran, and for future products we successfully develop where we may retain certain product development and commercialization rights, we could face a number of additional risks, including:\n\u2022scaling and retaining our global sales, marketing and administrative infrastructure and capabilities;\n\u2022hiring, training, managing and supervising our personnel worldwide;\n\u2022the cost of further developing, or leveraging an established, marketing or sales force, which may not be justifiable in light of the revenues generated by any particular product and/or in any specific geographic region; and\n\u2022our direct sales and marketing efforts may not be successful.\nIf we are unable to continue to develop and scale our own global marketing, sales, market access and distribution capabilities for ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI, OXLUMO and any future products, including vutrisiran, we will not be able to successfully commercialize our products without reliance on third parties.\nThe patient populations suffering from hATTR amyloidosis, AHP and PH1 are small and have not been established with precision. If the actual number of patients is smaller than we estimate, or if we cannot raise awareness of these diseases and diagnosis is not improved, our revenue and ability to achieve profitability from these products may be adversely affected.\nOur estimates regarding the potential market size for ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI, OXLUMO or any future products, including vutrisiran, at the time we commence commercialization, may be materially different from the actual market size, including as a result of the indication approved by regulatory authorities, which could result in significant changes in our business plan and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. For example, the indication approved by the FDA for ONPATTRO is for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis and not for the treatment of cardiomyopathy or other manifestations of the disease. In addition, the U.S. label does not include data from the exploratory cardiac endpoints included in our APOLLO Phase 3 study. This could have an adverse impact on the market opportunity for ONPATTRO in the U.S. In addition, our efforts to raise disease awareness and improve diagnosis of hATTR amyloidosis have been and may in the future be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, Alnylam Act, our third-party genetic screening initiative in the U.S., Canada and Brazil, experienced a decrease in submitted samples in the second quarter of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As is the case with most orphan diseases, if we cannot successfully raise awareness of these diseases and improve diagnosis, it will be more difficult or impossible to achieve profitability.\nAny drugs we develop may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, thereby harming our business.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drugs vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. We are actively monitoring these regulations as we market and sell ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO, and as several of our other programs move through late stages of development. However, a number of our programs are currently in the earlier stages of development, and we will not be able to assess the impact of price regulations for such programs for a number of years. We might obtain regulatory approval for a product, including one or more of our approved products, in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country and potentially in other countries due to reference pricing.\nOur ability to commercialize our approved products or any future products, including vutrisiran, successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. One or more of our approved products and other products for which we are able to obtain marketing approval, including vutrisiran, may not be considered cost-effective, and the amount reimbursed may be insufficient to allow us to sell such product(s) or any future products, including vutrisiran on a competitive basis. Increasingly, the third-party payors who reimburse patients or healthcare providers, such as government and private insurance plans, are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices, and are seeking to reduce the prices charged or the amounts reimbursed for drug products. In the U.S., we have entered into at least 40 VBAs, and are negotiating additional VBAs with commercial health insurers. The goal of these agreements is to ensure that we are paid based on the ability of our commercially approved products to deliver results in the real world setting comparable to those demonstrated in clinical trials, and the agreements are structured to link the performance of our approved products in real-world use to financial terms. Partnering with payers on these agreements is also intended to provide more certainty to them for their investment and help accelerate coverage decisions for patients. If the payment we receive for our products, or the reimbursement provided for such products, is inadequate in light of our development and other costs, or if reimbursement is denied, our return on investment could be adversely affected. In addition, we have stated publicly that we intend to grow through continued scientific innovation rather than arbitrary price increases. Specifically, we have stated that we will not raise the price of any product for which we receive marketing approval over the rate of inflation, as determined by the consumer price index for urban consumers (approximately 7.0% currently) absent a significant value driver. Our patient access philosophy could also negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of one or more of our products in the future.\nSome of the drugs we market need to be administered under the supervision of a physician or other healthcare professional on an outpatient basis, including ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO. Under currently applicable U.S. law, certain drugs that are not usually self-administered (including injectable drugs) may be eligible for coverage under the Medicare Part B program if:\n\u2022they are incident to a physician\u2019s services;\n\u2022they are reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of the illness or injury for which they are administered according to accepted standards of medical practice; and\n\u2022they have been approved by the FDA and meet other requirements of the statute.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining coverage for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for coverage does not imply that any drug will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution or that covers a particular provider\u2019s cost of acquiring the drug. Interim payments for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement may be based on payments allowed for lower-cost drugs that are already reimbursed, may be incorporated into existing payments for other services and may reflect budgetary constraints or imperfections in Medicare data. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the U.S.\nPresident Biden signed an Executive Order on July 9, 2021, affirming the administration\u2019s policy to (i) support legislative reforms that would lower the prices of prescription drugs, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation caps, and, by supporting the development and market entry of lower-cost generic drugs and biosimilars; and (ii) support the enactment of a public health insurance option. Among other things, the Executive Order also directs the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, to provide a report on actions to combat excessive pricing of prescription drugs, continue to clarify and improve the approval framework for generic drugs and identify and address any efforts to impede generic drug competition, enhance the domestic drug supply chain, reduce the price that the Federal government pays for drugs, and address price gouging in the industry; and directs the FDA to work with states and Indian Tribes that propose to develop\nsection 804 Importation Programs in accordance with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, and the FDA\u2019s implementing regulations. The FDA released such implementing regulations on September 24, 2020, which went into effect on November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. In response, authorities in Canada have passed rules designed to safeguard the Canadian drug supply from shortages. If implemented, importation of drugs from Canada and the Most Favored Nation, or MFN, Model may materially and adversely affect the price we receive for any of our commercially approved products. Further, on November 20, 2020, CMS issued an Interim Final Rule implementing the MFN Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates will be calculated for certain drugs based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita. The MFN Model regulations mandate participation by identified Part B providers and would have applied to all U.S. states and territories for a seven-year period beginning January 1, 2021, and ending December 31, 2027. However, on December 29, 2021, CMS rescinded the proposed MFN rule. Additionally, on December 2, 2020, HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to court order, the removal and addition of the aforementioned safe harbors have been delayed until January 1, 2023, requiring manufacturers to ensure the full value of co-pay assistance is passed on to the patient or these dollars will count toward the Average Manufacturer Price and Best Price calculation of the drug. On May 21, 2021, PhRMA sued the HHS in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, to stop the implementation of the rule claiming that the rule contradicts federal law surrounding Medicaid rebates. It is unclear how the outcome of this litigation will affect the rule. We cannot predict how the implementation of and any further changes to this rule will affect our business. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the current U.S. presidential administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the current U.S. presidential administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.\nWe believe that the efforts of governments and third-party payors to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare and legislative and regulatory proposals to broaden the availability of healthcare will continue to affect the business and financial condition of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.\nA number of other legislative and regulatory changes in the healthcare system in the U.S. and other major healthcare markets have been proposed or enacted in recent months and years, and such efforts have expanded substantially in recent years. These developments could, directly or indirectly, affect our ability to sell ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI, OXLUMO or future products, if approved, including vutrisiran, at a favorable price.\nIn particular, in March 2010, the ACA was signed into law. This legislation changed the system of healthcare insurance and benefits intended to broaden coverage and control costs. The law also contains provisions that affect companies in the pharmaceutical industry and other healthcare related industries by imposing additional costs and changes to business practices. Among the provisions affecting pharmaceutical companies are the following:\n\u2022Mandatory rebates for drugs sold into the Medicaid program were increased, and the rebate requirement was extended to drugs used in risk-based Medicaid managed care plans.\n\u2022The 340B Drug Pricing Program under the Public Health Service Act was extended to require mandatory discounts for drug products sold to certain critical access hospitals, cancer hospitals and other covered entities.\n\u2022Pharmaceutical companies are required to offer discounts on brand-name drugs to patients who fall within the Medicare Part D coverage gap, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole.\u201d\n\u2022Pharmaceutical companies are required to pay an annual non-tax deductible fee to the federal government based on each company\u2019s market share of prior year total sales of branded products to certain federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid, Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense. Since we expect our branded pharmaceutical sales to constitute a small portion of the total federal healthcare program pharmaceutical market, we do not expect this annual assessment to have a material impact on our financial condition.\n\u2022The law provides that approval of an application for a follow-on biologic product may not become effective until 12 years after the date on which the reference innovator biologic product was first licensed by the FDA, with a possible six-month extension for pediatric products. After this exclusivity ends, it will be easier for generic manufacturers to enter the market, which is likely to reduce the pricing for such products and could affect our profitability.\n\u2022The law creates a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected.\n\u2022The law expands eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer\u2019s Medicaid rebate liability.\n\u2022The law expands the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service Act pharmaceutical pricing program.\n\u2022The law expands healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the civil FCA and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance.\n\u2022The law establishes new requirements to report financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals and to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians.\n\u2022The law establishes a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.\n\u2022The law established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery methods.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030; however, pursuant to the CARES Act, and subsequent legislation, these Medicare sequester reductions have been suspended from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for our approved products or any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval, including vutrisiran, or the frequency with which our products or any future product, including vutrisiran, is prescribed or used.\nFurther, there have been several changes to the 340B Drug Pricing Program, which imposes ceilings on prices that drug manufacturers can charge for medications sold to certain healthcare facilities. On December 27, 2018, the District Court for the District of Columbia invalidated a reimbursement formula change under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, and CMS subsequently altered the fiscal years 2019 and 2018 reimbursement formula on specified covered outpatient drugs. The court ruled this change was not an \u201cadjustment\u201d which was within the Secretary\u2019s discretion to make but was instead a fundamental change in the reimbursement calculation. However, most recently, on July 31, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned the district court\u2019s decision and found that the changes were within the Secretary\u2019s authority. On September 14, 2020, the plaintiffs-appellees filed a Petition for Rehearing En Banc (i.e., before the full court), and the court denied this petition on October 16, 2020. Plaintiffs-appellees filed a petition for a writ of certiorari at the Supreme Court on February 10, 2021. On Friday July 2, 2021, the Supreme Court granted the petition. It is unclear how these developments could affect covered hospitals who might purchase our future products and affect the rates we may charge such facilities for our approved products in the future, if any.\nThe full effects of the U.S. healthcare reform legislation cannot be known until the law is fully implemented through regulations or guidance issued by CMS and other federal and state healthcare agencies. The financial impact of the U.S. healthcare reform legislation over the next few years will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited, to the policies reflected in implementing regulations and guidance, and changes in sales volumes for products affected by the new system of rebates, discounts and fees. This legislation may also have a positive impact on our future net sales, if any, by increasing the aggregate number of persons with healthcare coverage in the U.S.\nSince its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court's decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for the purpose of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact our business.\nAt the state level, legislatures have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing. Some of these measures include price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, measures designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing.\nWe cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. Further federal and state legislative and regulatory developments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives in the U.S. to increase pressure on drug pricing. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from one or more of our approved products or other product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop drug candidates.\nWe are subject to U.S. and certain foreign export and import controls, sanctions, embargoes, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these legal standards could impair our ability to compete in domestic and international markets. We can face criminal liability and other serious consequences for violations, which can harm our business.\nWe are subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations, various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and other state and national anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, contractors, and other collaborators from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or anything else of value to recipients in the public or private sector. From time to time, we may engage third parties to conduct clinical trials outside of the U.S., to sell our products abroad, and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations, and other regulatory approvals. We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities, and other organizations. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees, agents, contractors, and other collaborators, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. Any violations of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences.\nWe remain focused on these laws and the activities they regulate and, as detailed above, maintain a global compliance program designed to empower our business to operate in compliance with their requirements.\nGovernments outside the U.S. may impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenues.\nThe pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is also subject to governmental control outside the U.S. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of regulatory approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our ability to generate revenues and become profitable could be impaired.\nIn some countries, including Member States of the EU, or Japan, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to governmental control. Additional countries may adopt similar approaches to the pricing of prescription drugs. In such countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after receipt of regulatory approval for a product. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Moreover, political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after coverage and reimbursement have been obtained. Reference pricing used by various countries and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced countries, can further reduce prices. In some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical study or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a product candidate to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval, which is time-consuming and costly. We cannot be sure that such prices and reimbursement will be acceptable to us or our strategic partners. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries. If pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels or if reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, our revenues from sales by us or our strategic partners and the potential profitability of our approved products or any future products, including vutrisiran, in those countries would be negatively affected. Another impact from the tightening pricing control could be felt from greater competition from less expensive generic or biosimilar products once the exclusivity expires; the governments have adopted policies to switch prescribed products to generic versions in order to cut the medical cost.\nIf we or our collaborators, CMOs or service providers fail to comply with healthcare laws and regulations, or legal obligations related to privacy, data protection and information security, we or they could be subject to enforcement actions, which could affect our ability to develop, market and sell our products and may harm our reputation.\nAs a manufacturer of pharmaceuticals, we are subject to federal, state, and comparable foreign healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights, in addition to legal obligations related to privacy, data protection and information security. These laws and regulations include:\n\u2022The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, the purchase, lease, order, arrangement, or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. Violations are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal FCA or federal civil money penalties.\n\u2022The U.S. federal false claims laws, including the FCA, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented, claims for payment by government-funded programs such as Medicare or Medicaid that are false or fraudulent, making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to \u201ccause\u201d the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery.\n\u2022The federal civil monetary penalties laws, which impose civil fines for, among other things, the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program, unless an exception applies.\n\u2022The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity can be found guilty of violating HIPAA without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it.\n\u2022HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and requires notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information.\n\u2022Federal \u201csunshine\u201d requirements imposed by the ACA on drug, device, biological and medical supply manufacturers when payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to HHS under the Open Payments Program, information regarding any payment or other \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately, and completely reported in an annual submission. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners.\n\u2022Federal price reporting laws, which require manufacturers to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs, where such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on approved products.\n\u2022Federal statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to pricing and sales of product to Federal Government Agencies.\n\u2022Federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.\n\u2022State and foreign laws comparable to each of the above federal laws, including in the EU laws prohibiting giving healthcare professionals any gift or benefit in kind as an inducement to prescribe our products, national transparency laws requiring the public disclosure of payments made to healthcare professionals and institutions, and data privacy laws, in addition to anti-kickback and false claims laws applicable to commercial insurers and other non-federal payors, requirements for mandatory corporate regulatory compliance programs, and laws relating to government reimbursement programs, patient data privacy and security.\n\u2022European Privacy Laws including Regulation 2016/679, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, and the e-Privacy Directive (202/58/EC), and the national laws implementing each of them, as well as the privacy laws of Japan and other territories. Failure to comply with our obligations under the privacy regime could expose us to significant fines and/or adverse publicity, which could have material adverse effects on our reputation and business.\n\u2022The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, effective as of January 1, 2020, that gives California residents expanded rights to access and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation.\nSome state laws also require pharmaceutical manufacturers to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare provides or marketing expenditures and pricing information. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the aforementioned requirements, we may be subject to penalties, including civil or criminal penalties (including individual imprisonment), criminal prosecution, monetary damages, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, or exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or the imposition of a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, any of which could adversely affect our financial results. As detailed above, we remain focused on enhancing our global compliance infrastructure following the commercial launch of our three products over the last three years in the U.S., EU and multiple other geographies, and as we prepare for the launch of our products in additional countries, assuming regulatory approvals. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for an alleged or suspected violation could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and could divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business, even if our defense is successful. In addition, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations may be costly to us in terms of money, time and resources.\nIf we or our collaborators, CMOs or service providers fail to comply with applicable federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions, which could affect our ability to develop, market and sell our approved products, or any other future products, successfully and could harm our reputation and lead to reduced acceptance of our products by the market. These enforcement actions include, among others:\n\u2022adverse regulatory inspection findings;\n\u2022untitled letters or warning letters;\n\u2022voluntary or mandatory product recalls or public notification or medical product safety alerts to healthcare professionals;\n\u2022restrictions on, or prohibitions against, marketing our products;\n\u2022restrictions on, or prohibitions against, importation or exportation of our products;\n\u2022suspension of review or refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;\n\u2022exclusion from participation in government-funded healthcare programs;\n\u2022exclusion from eligibility for the award of government contracts for our products;\n\u2022suspension or withdrawal of product approvals;\n\u2022product seizures;\n\u2022injunctions; and\n\u2022civil and criminal penalties, up to and including criminal prosecution resulting in fines, exclusion from healthcare reimbursement programs and imprisonment.\nMoreover, federal, state or foreign laws or regulations are subject to change, and while we, our collaborators, CMOs and/or service providers currently may be compliant, that could change due to changes in interpretation, prevailing industry standards or the legal structure.\nWe are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations, particularly related to privacy, data protection and information security, and we are subject to consumer protection laws that regulate our marketing practices and prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.\nThe GDPR imposes strict requirements on controllers and processors of personal data, including special protections for \u201cspecial category data,\u201d which includes health, biometric and genetic information of data subjects located in the EU and UK. Further, GDPR provides a broad right for EU Member States to create supplemental national laws, such as laws relating to the processing of health, genetic and biometric data, which could further limit our ability to use and share such data or could cause our costs to increase, and harm our business and financial condition. GDPR grants individuals the opportunity to object to the processing of their personal information, allows them to request deletion of personal information in certain circumstances, and provides the individual with an express right to seek legal remedy in the event the individual believes his or her rights have been violated.\nFailure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States, which may deviate slightly from the GDPR, may result in fines of up to 4% of total global annual revenue, or \u20ac20,000,000, whichever is greater, and in addition to such fines, we may be the subject of litigation and/or adverse publicity, which could have material adverse effect on our reputation and business. As a result of the implementation of the GDPR, we are required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new data protection rules. For example, the GDPR requires us to make more detailed disclosures to data subjects, requires disclosure of the legal basis on which we can process personal data, may make it harder for us to obtain valid consent for processing, will require the appointment of a data protection officer where sensitive personal data (i.e., health data) is processed on a large scale, introduces mandatory data breach notification requirements throughout the EU and UK, imposes additional obligations on us when we are contracting with service providers and requires us to adopt appropriate privacy governance including policies, procedures, training and data audit.\nSignificantly, the GDPR imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU to the U.S. or other regions that have not been deemed to offer \u201cadequate\u201d privacy protections. In the past, companies in the U.S. were able to rely upon the EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks to legitimize data transfers from the EU and the UK to the U.S. In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, or CJEU, in Case C-311/18 (Data Protection Commissioner v Facebook Ireland and Maximillian Schrems, or Schrems II) invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield on the grounds that the Privacy Shield failed to offer adequate protections to EU personal data transferred to the U.S. The CJEU, in the same decision, deemed that the Standard Contractual Clauses, or SCCs, published by the EC are valid. However, the CJEU ruled that transfers made pursuant to the SCCs need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis to ensure the law in the recipient country provides \u201cessentially equivalent\u201d protections to safeguard the transferred personal data as the EU, and required businesses to adopt supplementary measures if such standard is not met. Subsequent guidance published by the European Data Protection Board in June 2021 described what such supplementary measures must be, and stated that businesses should avoid or cease transfers of personal data if, in the absence of supplementary measures, equivalent protections cannot be afforded. On June 4, 2021, the EC published new versions of the SCCs, which seek to address the issues identified by the CJEU\u2019s Schrems II decision and provide further details regarding the transfer assessments that the parties are required to conduct when implementing the New SCCs. However, there continue to be concerns about whether the SCCs and other mechanisms will face additional challenges. Similarly, the Swiss data protection authority determined the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield framework was no longer a valid mechanism for Swiss-U.S. data transfers and also raised questions about the validity of the SCCs as a mechanism for transferring personal data from Switzerland. While Standard Contractual Clauses provide an alternative to our Privacy Shield certification for EU-U.S. data flows, the decision (and certain regulatory guidance issued in its wake) casts doubt on the legality of EU-U.S. data flows in general. Any inability to transfer personal data from the EU to the U.S. in compliance with data protection laws may impede our ability to conduct trials and may adversely affect our business and financial position. The UK is not subject to the EC\u2019s new SCCs but has published a draft version of its International Transfer Agreement, which, once finalized, will enable transfer from the UK.\nWe are subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in those jurisdictions where we are monitoring the behavior of individuals in the EU or UK (i.e., undertaking clinical trials). We depend on a number of third parties in relation to the provision of our services, a number of which process personal data of EU and/or UK individuals on our behalf. With each such provider we enter or intend to enter into contractual arrangements under which they are contractually obligated to only process personal data according to our instructions, and conduct or intend to conduct diligence to ensure that they have sufficient technical and organizational security measures in place.\nWe are also subject to evolving European privacy laws on electronic marketing and cookies. The EU is in the process of replacing the e-Privacy Directive (2002/58/EC) with a new set of rules taking the form of a regulation, which will be directly implemented in the laws of each European member state, without the need for further enactment. While the e-Privacy\nRegulation was originally intended to be adopted on May 25, 2018 (alongside the GDPR), it is still going through the European legislative process. Draft regulations were rejected by the Permanent Representatives Committee of the Council of EU on November 22, 2019; it is not clear when new regulations will be adopted.\nCompliance with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations could require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to collect, use and disclose data, or in some cases, impact our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil, criminal and administrative penalties), private litigation, and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. Moreover, clinical trial subjects, employees and other individuals about whom we or our potential collaborators obtain personal information, as well as the providers who share this information with us, may limit our ability to collect, use and disclose the information. Claims that we have violated individuals\u2019 privacy rights, failed to comply with data protection laws, or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.\nOur ability to obtain services, reimbursement or funding from the federal government may be impacted by possible reductions in federal spending and services, and any inability on our part to effectively adapt to such changes could substantially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nUnder the Budget Control Act of 2011, the failure of Congress to enact deficit reduction measures of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021 triggered automatic cuts to most federal programs. These cuts included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, starting in 2013. Certain of these automatic cuts have been implemented resulting in reductions in Medicare payments to physicians, hospitals, and other healthcare providers, among other things. Due to legislation amending the statute, including the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, these reductions will stay in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Pursuant to the CARES Act, as well as subsequent legislation, these reductions have been suspended from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The full impact on our business of these automatic cuts is uncertain.\nIf other federal spending is reduced, any budgetary shortfalls may also impact the ability of relevant agencies, such as the FDA or the NIH to continue to function. Amounts allocated to federal grants and contracts may be reduced or eliminated. These reductions may also impact the ability of relevant agencies to timely review and approve drug research and development, manufacturing, and marketing activities, which may delay our ability to develop, market and sell our approved products and any other products we may develop, including vutrisiran.\nThere is a substantial risk of product liability claims in our business. If we are unable to obtain sufficient insurance, a product liability claim against us could adversely affect our business.\nOur business exposes us to significant potential product liability risks that are inherent in the development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of human therapeutic products. Product liability claims could delay or prevent completion of our clinical development programs. Following the decision to discontinue clinical development of revusiran, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of available revusiran data. We reported the results of this evaluation in August 2017, however, our investigation did not result in a conclusive explanation regarding the cause of the mortality imbalance observed in the ENDEAVOUR Phase 3 study. In addition, in September 2017, we announced that we had temporarily suspended dosing in all ongoing fitusiran studies pending further review of a fatal thrombotic SAE and agreement with regulatory authorities on a risk mitigation strategy. Notwithstanding the risks undertaken by all persons who participate in clinical trials, and the information on risks provided to study investigators and patients participating in our clinical trials, including the revusiran and fitusiran studies, it is possible that product liability claims will be asserted against us relating to the worsening of a patient\u2019s condition, injury or death alleged to have been caused by one of our product candidates, including revusiran or fitusiran. Such claims might not be fully covered by product liability insurance. In addition, product liability claims could result in an FDA investigation of the safety and effectiveness of our approved products, our manufacturing processes and facilities or our marketing programs, and potentially a recall of our products or more serious enforcement action, limitations on the approved indications for which they may be used, or suspension or withdrawal of approvals. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may also result in decreased demand for our products, injury to our reputation, costs to defend the related litigation, a diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources, substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients and a decline in our stock price. We currently have product liability insurance that we believe is appropriate for our stage of development, including the marketing and sale of our approved products. Any insurance we have or may obtain may not provide sufficient coverage against potential liabilities. Furthermore, clinical trial and product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive. As a result, we may be unable to obtain sufficient insurance at a reasonable cost to protect us against losses caused by product liability claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements or insider trading violations, which could significantly harm our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with governmental regulations, comply with healthcare fraud and abuse and anti-kickback laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad, or failure to report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized\nactivities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of, including improper trading based upon, information obtained in the course of clinical studies, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. As detailed above, we maintain a global compliance program and remain focused on its evolution and enhancement. Our program includes efforts such as risk assessment and monitoring, fostering a culture encouraging employees and third parties to raise good faith questions or concerns, and defined processes and systems for reviewing and remediating allegations and identified potential concerns. It is not always possible, however, to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nIf we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur research, development and manufacturing involve the use of hazardous materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds. We maintain quantities of various flammable and toxic chemicals in our facilities in Cambridge and Norton that are required for our research, development and manufacturing activities. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. We believe our procedures for storing, handling and disposing these materials in our Cambridge and Norton facilities comply with the relevant guidelines of the City of Cambridge, the town of Norton, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards mandated by applicable regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. If an accident occurs, we could be held liable for resulting damages, which could be substantial. We are also subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of biohazardous materials.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of these materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials. Additional federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our operations may be adopted in the future. We may incur substantial costs to comply with, and substantial fines or penalties if we violate, any of these laws or regulations.\nRisks Related to Patents, Licenses and Trade Secrets\nIf we are not able to obtain and enforce patent protection for our discoveries, our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates will be harmed.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to protect proprietary compositions, methods and technologies that we develop under the patent and other intellectual property laws of the U.S. and other countries, so that we can prevent others from unlawfully using our inventions and proprietary information. However, we may not hold proprietary rights to some patents required for us to manufacture and commercialize our proposed products. Because certain U.S. patent applications are confidential until the patents issue, such as applications filed prior to November 29, 2000, or applications filed after such date which will not be filed in foreign countries, third parties may have filed patent applications for subject matter covered by our pending patent applications without our being aware of those applications, and our patent applications may not have priority over those applications. For this and other reasons, we may be unable to secure desired patent rights, thereby losing desired exclusivity. Further, we or our licensees may be required to obtain licenses under third-party patents to market one or more of our or our partner's approved products, or further develop and commercialize future products, or continue to develop candidates in our pipeline being developed by us or our licensees. If licenses are not available to us or not available on reasonable terms, we or our licensees may not be able to market the affected products or conduct the desired activities.\nOur strategy depends on our ability to rapidly identify and seek patent protection for our discoveries. In addition, we may rely on third-party collaborators to file patent applications relating to proprietary technology that we develop jointly during certain collaborations. The process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming. If our present or future collaborators fail to file and prosecute all necessary and desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, our business may be adversely affected. Despite our efforts and the efforts of our collaborators to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may be able to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. While issued patents are presumed valid, this does not guarantee that the patent will survive a validity challenge or be held enforceable. Any patents we have obtained, or obtain in the future, may be challenged, invalidated, adjudged unenforceable or circumvented by\nparties attempting to design around our intellectual property. Moreover, third parties or the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, may commence interference proceedings involving our patents or patent applications. Any challenge to, finding of unenforceability or invalidation or circumvention of, our patents or patent applications, would be costly, would require significant time and attention of our management, could reduce or eliminate royalty payments to us from third party licensors and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur pending patent applications may not result in issued patents. The patent position of pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, including ours, is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual considerations. The standards that the USPTO and its foreign counterparts use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. Similarly, the ultimate degree of protection that will be afforded to biotechnology inventions, including ours, in the U.S. and foreign countries, remains uncertain and is dependent upon the scope of the protection decided upon by patent offices, courts and lawmakers. Moreover, there are periodic discussions in the Congress of the United States and in international jurisdictions about modifying various aspects of patent law. For example, the America Invents Act, or AIA, included a number of changes to the patent laws of the U.S. If any of the enacted changes do not provide adequate protection for discoveries, including our ability to pursue infringers of our patents for substantial damages, our business could be adversely affected. One major provision of the AIA, which took effect in March 2013, changed U.S. patent practice from a first-to-invent to a first-to-file system. If we fail to file an invention before a competitor files on the same invention, we no longer have the ability to provide proof that we were in possession of the invention prior to the competitor\u2019s filing date, and thus would not be able to obtain patent protection for our invention. There is also no uniform, worldwide policy regarding the subject matter and scope of claims granted or allowable in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents.\nAccordingly, we do not know the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights or the breadth of claims that will be allowed in any patents issued to us or to others. We also rely to a certain extent on trade secrets, know-how and technology, which are not protected by patents, to maintain our competitive position. If any trade secret, know-how or other technology not protected by a patent were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to obtain and maintain all available regulatory exclusivities, broad patent scope and to maximize patent term restoration or extension on patents covering our products may lead to loss of exclusivity and early generic entry resulting in a loss of market share and/or revenue.\nWe license patent rights from third-party owners. If such owners do not properly or successfully obtain, maintain or enforce the patents underlying such licenses, our competitive position and business prospects may be harmed.\nWe are a party to a number of licenses that give us rights to third-party intellectual property that is necessary or useful for our business. In particular, we have obtained licenses from, among others, Stanford University, Ionis, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, or Whitehead, Max Planck Innovation GmbH (formerly known as Garching Innovation GmbH), or Max Planck, Arbutus, and Dicerna. We also intend to enter into additional licenses to third-party intellectual property in the future.\nOur success will depend in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our licensed intellectual property, in particular, those patents to which we have secured exclusive rights. Our licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications to which we are licensed. Even if patents issue in respect of these patent applications, our licensors may fail to maintain these patents, may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents, or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would. Without protection for the intellectual property we license, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects. In addition, we sublicense our rights under various third-party licenses to our collaborators. Any impairment of these sublicensed rights could result in reduced revenues under our collaboration agreements or result in termination of an agreement by one or more of our collaborators.\nOther companies or organizations may challenge our patent rights or may assert patent rights that prevent us from developing and commercializing our products.\nRNAi is a relatively new scientific field, the commercial exploitation of which has resulted in many different patents and patent applications from organizations and individuals seeking to obtain patent protection in the field. We have obtained grants and issuances of RNAi patents and have licensed many of these patents from third parties on an exclusive basis. The issued patents and pending patent applications in the U.S. and in key markets around the world that we own or license claim many different methods, compositions and processes relating to the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics.\nSpecifically, we have a portfolio of patents, patent applications and other intellectual property covering: fundamental aspects of the structure and uses of siRNAs, including their use as therapeutics, and RNAi-related mechanisms; chemical modifications to siRNAs that improve their suitability for therapeutic and other uses; siRNAs directed to specific targets as treatments for particular diseases; delivery technologies, such as in the fields of carbohydrate conjugates and cationic liposomes; and all aspects of our specific development candidates.\nAs the field of RNAi therapeutics is maturing, patent applications are being fully processed by national patent offices around the world. There is uncertainty about which patents will issue, and, if they do, as to when, to whom, and with what claims. It is likely that there will be significant litigation and other proceedings, such as interference, re-examination and opposition proceedings, as well as inter partes and post-grant review proceedings introduced by provisions of the AIA, which became available to third party challengers on September 16, 2012, in various patent offices relating to patent rights in the RNAi field. In addition, third parties may challenge the validity of our patents. For example, a third party has filed an opposition in the European Patent Office, or EPO, against our owned patent EP 2723758, with claims directed to compositions and methods of ANGPTL3, arguing that the granted claims are invalid. An oral hearing was held at the EPO on February 17, 2021, where the patent was revoked. A notice of appeal of the EPO's decision was filed on June 23, 2021. We expect that additional oppositions will be filed in the EPO and elsewhere, and other challenges will be raised relating to other patents and patent applications in our portfolio. In many cases, the possibility of appeal exists for either us or our opponents, and it may be years before final, unappealable rulings are made with respect to these patents in certain jurisdictions. The timing and outcome of these and other proceedings is uncertain and may adversely affect our business if we are not successful in defending the patentability and scope of our pending and issued patent claims. Even if our rights are not directly challenged, disputes could lead to the weakening of our intellectual property rights. Our defense against any attempt by third parties to circumvent or invalidate our intellectual property rights could be costly to us, could require significant time and attention of our management and could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to successfully compete in the field of RNAi.\nThere are many issued and pending patents that claim aspects of oligonucleotide chemistry and modifications that we may need for our siRNA products marketed by us or our licensees, our late-stage therapeutic candidates being developed by us or our licensees, including vutrisiran, zilebesiran and fitusiran, as well as our other pipeline products. There are also many issued patents that claim targeting genes or portions of genes that may be relevant for siRNA drugs we wish to develop. In addition, there may be issued and pending patent applications that may be asserted against us in a court proceeding or otherwise based upon the asserting party\u2019s belief that we may need such patents for our siRNA therapeutic candidates or marketed products, or further develop and commercialize future products such as vutrisiran, currently under review with the FDA, or continuing to develop candidates in our pipeline being developed by us or our licensees. Thus, it is possible that one or more organizations will hold patent rights to which we may need a license, or hold patent rights which could be asserted against us. If those organizations refuse to grant us a license to such patent rights on reasonable terms and/or a court rules that we need such patent rights that have been asserted against us and we are not able to obtain a license on reasonable terms, we may be unable to market products, including ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI or OXLUMO, or perform research and development or other activities covered by such patents. For example, during 2017 and 2018, Silence filed claims in several jurisdictions, including the High Court of England and Wales, and named us and our wholly owned subsidiary Alnylam UK Ltd. as co-defendants. Silence alleged various claims, including that ONPATTRO infringed one or more Silence patents. There were also a number of related actions brought by us or Silence in connection with this intellectual property dispute. In December 2018, we entered into a Settlement and License Agreement with Silence, resolving all ongoing claims, administrative proceedings, and regulatory proceedings worldwide between us regarding, among other issues, patent infringement, patent invalidity and breach of contract.\nIf we become involved in patent litigation or other proceedings related to a determination of rights, we could incur substantial costs and expenses, substantial liability for damages or be required to stop our product development and commercialization efforts.\nThird parties may sue us for infringing their patent rights. For example, in October 2017 Silence sued us in the UK alleging that ONPATTRO and other investigational RNAi therapeutics we or MDCO are developing infringed one or more Silence patents. Likewise, we may need to resort to litigation to enforce a patent issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of proprietary rights of others or protect our proprietary information and trade secrets. For example, during the second quarter of 2015, we filed a trade secret misappropriation lawsuit against Dicerna to protect our rights in the RNAi assets we purchased from Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., or Merck. We and Dicerna settled the ongoing litigation between us in April 2018 and in December 2018 we and Silence settled all ongoing litigation between us. A third party may also claim that we have improperly obtained or used its confidential or proprietary information.\nIn protecting our intellectual patent rights through litigation or other means, a third party may claim that we have improperly asserted our rights against them. For example, in August 2017, Dicerna successfully added counterclaims against us in the above-referenced trade secret lawsuit alleging that our lawsuit represented abuse of process and claiming tortious interference with its business. In addition, in August 2017, Dicerna filed a lawsuit against us in the United States District Court of Massachusetts alleging attempted monopolization by us under the Sherman Antitrust Act. As noted above, in April 2018, we and Dicerna settled the ongoing litigation between us.\nFurthermore, third parties may challenge the inventorship of our patents or licensed patents. For example, in March 2011, The University of Utah, or Utah, filed a complaint against us, Max Planck Gesellschaft Zur Foerderung Der Wissenschaften e.V. and Max Planck Innovation, together, Max Planck, Whitehead, MIT and the University of Massachusetts, claiming that a professor of Utah was the sole inventor, or in the alternative, a joint inventor of certain of our in-licensed patents. Utah was seeking correction of inventorship of the Tuschl patents, unspecified damages and other relief. After several years of court proceedings and discovery, the court granted our motions for summary judgment, and dismissed Utah\u2019s state law damages claims as well. During the pendency of this litigation, as well as the Dicerna litigation described above, we incurred significant\ncosts, and in each case, the litigation diverted the attention of our management and other resources that would otherwise have been engaged in other activities.\nIn addition, in connection with certain license and collaboration agreements, we have agreed to indemnify certain third parties for certain costs incurred in connection with litigation relating to intellectual property rights or the subject matter of the agreements. The cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding relating to intellectual property rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and litigation would divert our management\u2019s efforts. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation or legal proceeding could delay our research, development and commercialization efforts and limit our ability to continue our operations.\nIf any parties successfully claim that our creation or use of proprietary technologies infringes upon or otherwise violates their intellectual property rights, we might be forced to pay damages, potentially including treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed on such parties\u2019 patent rights. In addition to any damages we might have to pay, a court could issue an injunction requiring us to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license. Any license required under any patent may not be made available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, such licenses are likely to be non-exclusive and, therefore, our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license and are unable to design around a patent, we may be unable to effectively market some of our technology and products, which could limit our ability to generate revenues or achieve profitability and possibly prevent us from generating revenue sufficient to sustain our operations. Moreover, we expect that a number of our collaborations will provide that royalties payable to us for licenses to our intellectual property may be offset by amounts paid by our collaborators to third parties who have competing or superior intellectual property positions in the relevant fields, which could result in significant reductions in our revenues from products developed through collaborations.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under any licenses or related agreements, we may be required to pay damages and could lose license or other rights that are necessary for developing, commercializing and protecting our RNAi technology, as well as our approved products and any other product candidates that we develop, or we could lose certain rights to grant sublicenses.\nOur current licenses impose, and any future licenses we enter into are likely to impose, various development, commercialization, funding, milestone, royalty, diligence, sublicensing, insurance, patent prosecution and enforcement, and other obligations on us. If we breach any of these obligations, or use the intellectual property licensed to us in an unauthorized manner, we may be required to pay damages and the licensor may have the right to terminate the license or render the license non-exclusive, which could result in us being unable to develop, manufacture, market and sell products that are covered by the licensed technology or enable a competitor to gain access to the licensed technology. Moreover, we could incur significant costs and/or disruption to our business and distraction of our management defending against any breach of such licenses alleged by the licensor. For example, in June 2018, Ionis sent us a notice claiming that it was owed payments under our second amended and restated strategic collaboration and license agreement as a result of the January 2018 amendment of our collaboration agreement with Sanofi and the related Exclusive TTR License and AT3 License Terms. Ionis claimed it was owed technology access fees, or TAFs, based on rights granted and amounts paid to us in connection with the Sanofi restructuring. Ionis later filed a Demand for Arbitration with the Boston office of the American Arbitration Association against us, asserting, among other things, breach of contract. Upon completion of the arbitration process in the second quarter of 2020, in October 2020, a partial award was issued by the arbitration panel that sought additional information from us. The arbitration panel issued its final award in December 2020, which ruled in favor of Ionis\u2019s request for a TAF on certain rights the panel determined we received in the Sanofi restructuring (but rejecting the TAF amount sought by Ionis), and in favor of us in denying Ionis\u2019s request for a TAF on a milestone payment received by us in the same restructuring. The panel\u2019s final award also denied Ionis\u2019s request for pre-judgement interest and attorney\u2019s fees. Pursuant to the panel's final award, we paid $41.2 million to Ionis in January 2021.\nMoreover, our licensors may own or control intellectual property that has not been licensed to us and, as a result, we may be subject to claims, regardless of their merit, that we are infringing or otherwise violating the licensor\u2019s rights. In addition, while we cannot currently determine the amount of the royalty obligations we will be required to pay on sales of each of our approved products or future products, if any, the amounts may be significant. The amount of our future royalty obligations will depend on the technology and intellectual property we use in such products. Therefore, even if we successfully develop and commercialize products, we may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nIn order to protect our proprietary technology and processes, we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees, consultants, CMOs, outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers, and other advisors. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information, and in such cases we could not assert any trade secret rights against such party. Costly and time-\nconsuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nRisks Related to Competition\nThe pharmaceutical market is intensely competitive. If we are unable to compete effectively with existing drugs, new treatment methods and new technologies, we may be unable to commercialize successfully any drugs that we develop.\nThe pharmaceutical market is intensely competitive and rapidly changing. Many large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are pursuing the development of novel drugs for the same diseases that we are targeting or expect to target. Many of our competitors have:\n\u2022much greater financial, technical and human resources than we have at every stage of the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of products;\n\u2022more extensive experience in pre-clinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and in manufacturing, marketing and selling drug products;\n\u2022product candidates that are based on previously tested or accepted technologies;\n\u2022products that have been approved or are in late stages of development; and\n\u2022collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research institutions.\nWe will face intense competition from drugs that have already been approved and accepted by the medical community for the treatment of the conditions for which we may develop drugs. We also expect to face competition from new drugs that enter the market. There are a number of drugs currently under development, which may become commercially available in the future, for the treatment of conditions for which we may try to develop drugs. These drugs may be more effective, safer, less expensive, or marketed and sold more effectively, than any products we develop and commercialize. For example, we developed ONPATTRO for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis. In August 2018, the FDA approved ONPATTRO lipid complex injection for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis in adults, and the EC granted marketing authorization for ONPATTRO for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis in adults with stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy. We are aware of other approved products used to treat this disease, including tafamidis, marketed by Pfizer, which is approved in a number of jurisdictions, and inotersen, developed and marketed by Ionis, as well as product candidates in various stages of clinical development, including an additional investigational drug. Finally, we are aware that BridgeBio Pharma, Inc. (formerly Eidos Therapeutics, Inc.), or BridgeBio, announced topline results from Part A of its Phase 3 clinical trial of acoramidis, a TTR stabilizer, in ATTR-CM in December 2021, which did not meet the primary endpoint of the study at month 12. BridgeBio initiated enrollment in Part B of its Phase 3 clinical trial of acoramidis in ATTR-PN patients in the fourth quarter of 2020, and anticipates topline results in 2023. While we believe that ONPATTRO has and will continue to have a competitive product profile for the treatment of patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, and if approved, that vutrisiran will have a competitive product profile in this indication, it is possible that ONPATTRO and/or vutrisiran may not compete favorably with these products and product candidates, or others, and, as a result, may not achieve commercial success. Moreover, positive or negative data and/or the commercial success or failure of competitive products could negatively impact our stock price. For example, our stock price was negatively impacted by the results of Part A of BridgeBio's Phase 3 clinical trial.\nIf we continue to successfully develop product candidates, and obtain approval for them, we will face competition based on many different factors, including:\n\u2022the safety and effectiveness of our products relative to alternative therapies, if any;\n\u2022the ease with which our products can be administered and the extent to which patients accept relatively new routes of administration;\n\u2022the timing and scope of regulatory approvals for these products;\n\u2022the availability and cost of manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities;\n\u2022the price of our products relative to alternative approved therapies;\n\u2022reimbursement coverage; and\n\u2022patent position.\nWe are aware of product candidates in various stages of clinical development for the treatment of PH1 which would compete with OXLUMO, our RNAi therapeutic approved in the U.S. and EU for the treatment of this disease, including Oxabact\u00ae, a bacteria-based investigational therapy in development by OxThera AB, reloxaliase an investigational enzyme therapy in Phase 3 development for primary or severe secondary hyperoxaluria by Allena Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and nedosiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic in development by Dicerna for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria. In July 2019, the FDA granted a Breakthrough Therapy Designation to nedosiran for the treatment of patients with primary hyperoxaluria, and in August 2021, Dicerna (acquired by Novo Nordisk in December 2021) announced positive topline results in its PHYOX2 pivotal\nclinical trial of nedosiran and expects to submit an NDA to the FDA in the first quarter of 2022. In April 2020, we and Dicerna granted each other a non-exclusive cross-license to our respective intellectual property related to lumasiran, and Dicerna\u2019s nedosiran product candidate. Our competitors may develop or commercialize products with significant advantages over any products we develop based on any of the factors listed above or on other factors. In addition, our competitors may develop strategic alliances with or receive funding from larger pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, providing them with an advantage over us. Our competitors may therefore be more successful in commercializing their products than we are, which could adversely affect our competitive position and business. Competitive products may make any products we develop obsolete or noncompetitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing our product candidates. Such competitors could also recruit our employees, which could negatively impact our level of expertise and the ability to execute on our business plan. Furthermore, we also face competition from existing and new treatment methods that reduce or eliminate the need for drugs, such as the use of advanced medical devices. The development of new medical devices or other treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could make our product candidates noncompetitive, obsolete or uneconomical.\nWe face competition from other companies that are working to develop novel drugs and technology platforms using technology similar to ours. If these companies develop drugs more rapidly than we do or their technologies, including delivery technologies, are more effective, our ability to successfully commercialize drugs may be adversely affected.\nIn addition to the competition we face from competing drugs in general, we also face competition from other companies working to develop novel drugs using technology that competes more directly with our own. We are aware of several other companies that are working to develop RNAi therapeutic products. Some of these companies are seeking, as we are, to develop chemically synthesized siRNAs as drugs. Others are following a gene therapy approach, with the goal of treating patients not with synthetic siRNAs but with synthetic, exogenously-introduced genes designed to produce siRNA-like molecules within cells. Companies working on chemically synthesized siRNAs include, but are not limited to, Takeda, Marina, Arrowhead, Quark, Silence, Arbutus, Sylentis, Dicerna and its collaborators, WAVE, Arcturus, and Genevant Sciences, launched by Arbutus and Roivant Sciences. In addition, we granted licenses or options for licenses to Ionis, Benitec, Arrowhead, Arbutus, Quark, Sylentis and others under which these companies may independently develop RNAi therapeutics against a limited number of targets. Any one of these companies may develop its RNAi technology more rapidly and more effectively than us.\nIn addition, as a result of agreements that we have entered into, Takeda has obtained a non-exclusive license, and Arrowhead, as the assignee of Novartis, has obtained specific exclusive licenses for 30 gene targets, that include access to certain aspects of our technology. We also compete with companies working to develop antisense-based drugs. Like RNAi therapeutics, antisense drugs target mRNAs in order to suppress the activity of specific genes. Akcea has received marketing approval for an antisense drug, inotersen that was developed by Ionis, for the treatment of stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with hATTR amyloidosis. Several antisense drugs developed by Ionis have been approved and are currently marketed, and Ionis has multiple antisense product candidates in clinical trials. Ionis is also developing antisense drugs using ligand-conjugated GalNAc technology licensed from us, and these drugs have been shown to have increased potency at lower doses in clinical and pre-clinical studies, compared with antisense drugs that do not use such licensed GalNAc technology. The development of antisense drugs is more advanced than that of RNAi therapeutics, and antisense technology may become the preferred technology for drugs that target mRNAs to silence specific genes.\nIn addition to competition with respect to RNAi and with respect to specific products, we face substantial competition to discover and develop safe and effective means to deliver siRNAs to the relevant cell and tissue types. Safe and effective means to deliver siRNAs to the relevant cell and tissue types may be developed by our competitors, and our ability to successfully commercialize a competitive product would be adversely affected. In addition, substantial resources are being expended by third parties in the effort to discover and develop a safe and effective means of delivering siRNAs into the relevant cell and tissue types, both in academic laboratories and in the corporate sector. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do, and if our competitors are able to negotiate exclusive access to those delivery solutions developed by third parties, we may be unable to successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nIf our stock price fluctuates, purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly and may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to factors that are beyond our control. The stock market in general has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, and the biotechnology sector in particular has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. The market prices of securities of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been extremely volatile, and have experienced fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the clinical development progress or operating performance of these companies, including as a result of adverse development events. For example, the trading price for our common stock and the common stock of other biopharmaceutical companies was highly volatile during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to evolve, and the extent to which the pandemic may impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. These broad market\nand sector fluctuations have resulted and could in the future result in extreme fluctuations in the price of our common stock, which could cause purchasers of our common stock to incur substantial losses.\nWe may incur significant costs from class action litigation.\nOur stock price may fluctuate for many reasons, including as a result of public announcements regarding the progress of our development and commercialization efforts or the development and commercialization efforts of our collaborators and/or competitors, the addition or departure of our key personnel, variations in our quarterly operating results and changes in market valuations of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. When the market price of a stock has been volatile as our stock price has been, holders of that stock have occasionally brought securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock.\nFor example, a class action complaint was filed on September 26, 2018 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts by stipulation of the parties and Order of the Court dated November 20, 2018). The complaint, as amended, or the Complaint, alleged that we and our Chief Executive Officer, former Chief Financial Officer and certain of our other executive officers violated certain federal securities laws, specifically under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The plaintiff sought unspecified damages on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of our common stock between September 20, 2017 and September 12, 2018. On March 23, 2020, the Court granted our motion to dismiss and dismissed the Complaint without prejudice, and subsequently in March 2021 denied plaintiffs' motion seeking leave to file a further amended complaint. Plaintiffs did not file a notice of appeal from such denial. This type of litigation is often expensive and diverts management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect the operation of our business. If we are ultimately required to pay significant defense costs, damages or settlement amounts, in excess of our insurance coverage, such payments could adversely affect our operations.\nWe may be the target of similar litigation in the future. For example, on September 12, 2019, the Chester County Employees Retirement Fund, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, filed a purported securities class action complaint alleging violation of federal securities laws against us, certain of our current and former directors and officers, and the underwriters of our November 14, 2017 public stock offering, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County. While we believe the allegations in the New York State Securities Litigation are without merit, in August 2021 the parties reached an agreement in principle to resolve the matter. A hearing is scheduled for April 12, 2022 in the Supreme Court of the State of New York regarding final approval of the settlement. Proceedings in the First Department are adjourned until February 2022, subject to further adjournment, pending final approval of any settlement. Future litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could cause serious harm to our business, operating results and financial condition. We maintain liability insurance; however, if any costs or expenses associated with this or any other litigation exceed our insurance coverage, we may be forced to bear some or all of these costs and expenses directly, which could be substantial. In addition, we have obligations to indemnify third parties in connection with certain litigation, including the New York State matter, and such obligations are not covered by insurance.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock, including by our significant stockholders, us or our directors and officers, could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nA small number of our stockholders beneficially own a substantial amount of our common stock. As of January 31, 2022, our seven largest stockholders beneficially owned in excess of 50% of our outstanding shares of common stock. If our significant stockholders, or we or our officers and directors, sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or there is a perception that such sales may occur, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. Sales of common stock by our significant stockholders might make it more difficult for us to raise funds by selling equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nRegeneron\u2019s ownership of our common stock could delay or prevent a change in corporate control.\nAs of May 21, 2019, the closing date of the stock purchase in connection with the 2019 Regeneron collaboration, Regeneron held approximately 4% of our outstanding common stock and has the right to increase its ownership up to 30%. This concentration of ownership could harm the market price of our common stock in the future by:\n\u2022delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company;\n\u2022impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving our company; or\n\u2022discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our\ncurrent management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. These provisions include:\n\u2022a classified board of directors;\n\u2022a prohibition on actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u2022limitations on the removal of directors; and\n\u2022advance notice requirements for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. These provisions would apply even if the proposed merger or acquisition could be considered beneficial by some stockholders.", "PERMNO": 90178, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ALNY"}
